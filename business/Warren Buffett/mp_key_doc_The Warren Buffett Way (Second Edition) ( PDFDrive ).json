Heemphasizes both the pluses and the minuses of Berkshire\u2019s businesses. Hebelieves that people who own stock in Berkshire Hathaway are ownersof the company, and he tells them as much as he would like to be told ifhe were in their shoes.When Buffett took control of Berkshire, the corporate net worth was$22 million. It has longbeen Buffett\u2019s goal to increase the book value of Berkshire Hathaway ata 15 percent annual rate\u2014well above the return achieved by the averageAmerican company. Since he took control of Berkshire in 1964, the gainhas been much greater: Book value per share has grown from $19 to$50,498, a rate of 22. This relative per-formance is all the more impressive when you consider that Berkshire ispenalized by both income and capital gains taxes and the Standard &Poor\u2019s 500 returns are pretax.1 Berkshire\u2019s Corporate Performance versus the S&P 500Annual Percentage ChangeIn Per-Share In S&P 500Book Value of with Dividends RelativeBerkshire Included ResultsYear (1) (2) (1)\u2013(2)1965 23.4Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2003 Annual Report.The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.8Overall Gain\u20141964\u20132003 259,485 4,743The World\u2019s Greatest Investor 7On a year-by-year basis, Berkshire\u2019s returns have at times beenvolatile; changes in the stock market and thus the underlying stocks thatBerkshire owns create wide swings in per share value (see Table 1.In 1998, Berkshire\u2019s value increased more than 48 percent. Then, in1999, Berkshire\u2019s increase dropped to a paltry 0. Two factors were involved: Berkshire\u2019s resultscan be traced to poor return on consumer nondurables (Coca-Cola andGillette), while the S&P increase was fu eled by the outstanding perfor-mance of technology stocks, which Berkshire does not own. Then in 2003,even though Berkshire had a terrific year\u2014book value up 21 percent\u2014the S&P did even better. When we look down the listof stocks that Buffett owns as well as the wholly owned companies in-side Berkshire, we are struck by the high degree of predictability re-flected there. I am pretty surethat if Coca-Cola, Gillette, or other similar businesses were today sellingat fifty cents on the dollar, Buffett would add more shares to Berkshire\u2019sportfolio. Perhaps in Buffett\u2019s rational mind, the sum total of his businessexperience in studying and operating the businesses in Berkshire\u2019s port-folio sets the bar of competence so high that it would be difficult toachieve a similar level of insight into a new industry.W e would be foolish indeed to assume that because the menu ofstocks available for purchase has been reduced, Warren Buffett is leftwithout investment options.But Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders should not feel they are beingdeprived of opportunities. The fourth principle states, \u201cOur preferencewould be able to reach our goal [of maximizing Berkshire\u2019s average an-nual rate of gain in intrinsic value] by directly owning a diversifiedgroup of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital.\u201dIn Berkshire\u2019s early years, owning common stocks made the mostsense economically. Now, as common stock prices have risen dramati-cally and the purchasing power of Berkshire\u2019s retained earnings hasmushroomed, the strategy of buying whole businesses, which is Buffett\u2019sstated preference, has come to the forefront. W e know that Buffett greatly en-joys his relationships with his operating managers and takes a great dealof pride in Berkshire\u2019s collection of operating businesses.The only activity Buffett involves himself in with Berkshire\u2019s operat-ing businesses is setting executive compensation and allocating the prof-its. Inside Berkshire\u2019s world, these decisions are highly rational. One is to make an invest-ment in Berkshire Hathaway and so participate in the economics ofthese outstanding businesses.293\u201cOur Main BusinessIs Insurance\u201dThe Early Days ofBerkshire HathawayWhen the Buffett Partnership took control of Berkshire Hathawayin 1965, stockholders\u2019 equity had dropped by half and loss fromoperations exceeded $10 million.THE INSURANCE BUSINESSIn March 1967, Berkshire Hathaway purchased, for $8. BerkshireHathaway the textile company would not long survive, but BerkshireHathaway the investment company that encompassed it was about totake off. As of 2004, Berkshire owns 38 insurance companies, includingtwo giants, the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO)and General Re, each of which has several subsidiaries.32 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett then spent five hours getting an education in the insurancebusiness from the only person working that day: Lorimer Davidson, aninvestment officer who eventually became the company\u2019s CEO.By 1991, Berkshire owned nearly half (48 percent) of GEICO. In 1994, serious discussions beganabout Berkshire\u2019s buying the entire company, and a year later the finaldeal was announced. At that point, Berkshire owned 51 percent ofGEICO, and agreed to purchase the rest for $2.9 billion booked in 1996, the year Berkshire took full ownership.\u201d3From the early bargain days of $2 a share in 1976, Buffett paidclose to $70 a share for the rest of the company in 1996.Knowing their close working relationship, it\u2019s a fair bet that Mungerhad a lot to say about Berkshire\u2019s other big insurance decision.34 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYGeneral Re CorporationIn 1996 Buffett paid $2.4It was his biggest acquisition by far; some have calledit the single biggest event in Berkshire history. By usingBerkshire stock to buy the company and its heavy bond portfolio, Buf-fett in one neat step shifted the balance of Berkshire\u2019s overall holdingsfrom 80 percent stocks to 60 percent.Just after Berkshire bought General Re, the company had one ofits worst years.\u201d7Buffett estimated that Berkshire\u2019s underwriting losses from the ter-rorist attacks on September 11 totaled $2. Under their leadership, he wrotein the 2003 letter to shar eholders, General Re \u201cwill be a powerful en-gine driving Berkshire\u2019s future profitability. The other is also a Berkshire company: theNational Indemnity reinsurance operation.Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupThe National Indemnity insurance operation inside Berkshire today is afar cry from the company that Buffett purchased in 1967. Today, this divi sion,\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 37run from National Indemnity\u2019s office in Stamford, Connecticut, con-tributes powerfully to Berkshire\u2019s revenues. He re-cently joked that when he joined Berkshire in 1982, he didn\u2019t evenknow how to spell reinsurance, yet Jain has built a tremendously prof-itable operation that earns Buffett\u2019s highest praise year in and year out. In 2003, the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Groupbrought in $4. Buffett held firm: Berkshire\u2019s insurance opera-tions would not move into unprofitable territory. Today, in annual revenue and profit, Berkshire\u2019s insurancegroup ranks second, only to AIG, in the property casualty industry. Ad-ditionally, the ratio of Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio ($35. Since that time, says Buffett,Berkshire has never knowingly wavered from this underwriting disci-pline.12WARREN BUFFETT , 2001\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 39large impact on Berkshire\u2019s overall performance for several years.Berkshire\u2019s superior financial strength has distinguished its insuranceoperations from the rest of the industry. When competitors vanish fromthe marketplace because they are frightened by recent losses, Berkshirestands by as a constant supplier of insurance. In a word, the financial in-tegrity that Buffett has imposed on Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies hascreated a franchise in what is otherwise a commodity business.\u201d13The stream of cash generated by Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations ismind-boggling: some $44.", "Berkshire_2002": "\u201dIn that same 2003 letter, Buffett explained that Berkshire wouldcontinue the capital allocation practices it had used in the past: \u201cIf stocksbecome cheaper than entire businesses, then we will buy them aggres-sively.)\u201d1To some extent, fixed-income investments will always be necessaryfor Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio because of Berkshire\u2019s concentrationin insurance companies. Still, Berkshire holds a significantly smaller percentage offixed-income securities in its insurance investment portfolio comparedwith other insurance companies. By the end of June1984, Berkshire Hathaway owned $139 million of WPPSS Project 1, 2,and 3 bonds (both low-coupon and high-coupon) with a face value of$205 million.With WPPSS, explains Buffett, Berkshire acquired a $139 millionbusiness that could expect to earn $22.7 million annually after tax (thecumulative value of WPPSS annual coupons) and would pay those earn-ings to Berkshire in cash.7 million after tax ($45 million pretax), it wouldhave cost Berkshire between $250 and $300 million\u2014assuming he couldfind one.Furthermore, Berkshire purchased the business (the bonds) at a 32 per-cent discount to book value.Investing in Fixed-Income Securities 147Of the total, 65 percent were in the energy industry and about $7 bil-lion were bought through Berkshire insurance companies.Describing his thinking in the 2002 letter to shar eholders, Buffettwrote, \u201cThe Berkshire management does not believe the credit risks as-sociated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly de-clined. The three were Berkshire Hathaway ($100 mil-lion), Legg Mason ($100 million) and Longleaf Partners ($300 million). The Government Employees Insurance Company,the auto insurance unit of Berkshire, stood to make $16.Although he never calculated his arbitrage performance over theyears, Buffett estimated that Berkshire has averaged an annual return ofabout 25 percent pretax.With Berkshire\u2019s historical success in arbitrage, shar eholders mightwonder why Buffett strayed from this str ategy.In any case, Berkshire\u2019s withdrawal from arbitrage was made easierwith the advent of convertible preferred stocks. This unpredictability, Buffett explains, is the precise rea-son Berkshire\u2019s investment was a convertible preferred issue rather thancommon stock.MidAmericanOn March 14, 2000, Berkshire acquired 34.Two years later, in March 2002, Berkshire bought 6.Since 2002, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries also have ac-quired approximately $1.In another but related transaction, a Berkshire subsidiary, MEHCInvestment Inc.This preferred stock does not generally vote with the common stock inthe election of directors, but in this deal Berkshire Hathaway gained theright to elect 20 percent of MidAmerican\u2019s board as well as rights of ap-proval over certain important transactions. In total, the company hadabout $19 billion of assets and $6 billion in annual revenues from 25states and several other countries, and was yielding Berkshire Hathawayabout $300 million per year. Hence the value of Berkshire\u2019s preferred stocks cannot be anyless than the value of a similar nonconvertible preferred and, because ofconversion rights, is probably more. In 2002, Berkshire\u2019s grossrealized gain from fixed-income investments was $1 billion.", "Warren_Buffett_Waybuyer_2003": " Thatone person is Warren Buffett.

This owner-oriented way of looking at po-tential investments is bedrock to Buffett\u2019s approach.Some of these companies, particularly the more recent acquisitions,are jewels that Buffett found in a typically Buffett-like way: He adver-tised for them in the Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.1WARREN BUFFETT , 1994Buying a Business 43good management in place. Some ofthem have been B erkshire companies for decades, and their stories havebecome part of the Buffett lore. It is noteworthy because it represents the first time Buffettmoved away from Ben Graham\u2019s dictum to buy only undervalued com-panies.\u201d To which Buffett added, \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t bought See\u2019s, we wouldn\u2019thave bought Coke. In 1983, Buffett paid Mrs., who was still at work44 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYuntil the year she died at the age of 104. \u201cOne piece of wisdom she im-parted,\u201d Buffett wrote, \u201cwas \u2018if you have the lowest price, customers willfind you at the bottom of a river.\u201d4In January 1986, Buffett paid $315 million in cash for the Scott &Fetzer Company, a conglomerate of twenty-one separate companies, in-cluding the makers of Kirby vacuum cleaners and World Book encyclo-pedia. It was one of Berkshire\u2019s largest business acquisitions up to thatpoint, and has since exceeded Buffett\u2019s own optimistic expectations. It isa model of an organization that creates a large return on equity withvery little debt\u2014and that is one of Buffett\u2019s favorite traits. Since Buffett bought it, Scott Fetzerhas distributed over 100 percent of its earnings back to Berkshire whilesimultaneously increasing its own earnings.In recent years, Warren Buffett has turned more and more of his at-tention to buying companies instead of shares. The story of how Buffettcame to acquire these diverse businesses is interesting in itself. It also owns46 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYand operates financing, loan-servicing, and insurance subsidiaries.The first aspect of the story is that Buffett had some hands-on ex-perience with the industry. Al Auxier, a professor of finance atthe University of Tennessee, brought a group of MBA students toOmaha to meet with Buffett for what Buffett describes as \u201ctwo hours ofgive-and-take.\u201d8Buying a Business 47In the fall of 2003, Buffett was invited to attend the University ofTennessee\u2019s MBA Symposium.An efficient, well-run company built on strong principles and show-ing consistent profitability is just what Warren Buffett likes to see. \u201cIn the past some retailers had shunned McLane,\u201d wrote Buffett in48 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYhis 2003 shar eholder letter, \u201cbecause it was owned by their major com-petitor.Recalling that August meeting, Buffett wrote to Berkshire share-holders, \u201cIt took me about ten seconds to decide that these were twomanagers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made adeal.INVESTING IN STOCKSIt is patently obvious that few of us are in a position to buy whole com-panies, as Buffett does. Their stories are included in this chapter becausethey give us such crisp insight into Buffett\u2019s way of thinking. W e may not be able to buy shares on the same scale asWarren Buffett, but we can profit from watching what he does. It is one of Buffett\u2019s most strongly held beliefs: Itmakes no sense to invest in a company or an industry you don\u2019t under-stand, because you won\u2019t be able to figure out what it\u2019s worth or totrack what it\u2019s doing.Buffett\u2019s relationship with Coca-Cola dates back to his childhood. For thenext fifty years, Buffett admits, he observed the phenomenal growth ofCoca-Cola, but he purchased textile mills, department stores, and wind-mill and farming equipment manufacturers. Even in 1986, when he for-mally announced that Cherry Coke would become the official softdrink of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meetings, Buffett had still notpurchased a share of Coca-Cola. It was not until two years later, in thesummer of 1988, that Buffett purchased his first shares of Coca-Cola.The best business to own, says Buffett, is one that over time canemploy large amounts of capital at very high rates of return.Because of this financial strength, and also because the product is sowell known, I use Coca-Cola as the primary example in Chapters 5through 8, which detail the tenets of the Warren Buffett Way.11WARREN BUFFETT , 199852 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmarket is 72.\u201dBuffett became interested in Gillette in the 1980s.\u201cGillette\u2019s business is very much the kind we like,\u201d Buffett said. Buffett re-ceived a 8.In 1989, Buffett joined Gillette\u2019s board of directors. Buffett\u2019s next step was to calculate the value of those12 million shares; in Chapter 8, we\u2019ll see how he went about it.54 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmargins. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant to go to bed every night,\u201d says Buffett,\u201cknowing there are 2. Buffett taught Katherine Grahamhow to run a successful business.Buffett first met Katherine Graham in 1971. At that time, Buffettowned stock in the New Yorker. Although the sale never materi-alized, Buffett came away very much impressed with the publisher ofthe Washington Post.56 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYFor the next two years, while business at the paper was improving,the mood on Wall Street was turning gloomy. And all the while,Warren Buffett was quietly buying shares in the Washington Post (seeFigure 4. Buffett assured her that Berkshire\u2019s purchase was for invest-ment purposes only. Katherine Graham res ponded by invit-ing Buffett to join the board of directors in 1974 and soon made himchairman of the finance committee. Warren Buffett was one of the ushers at herfuneral services at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral.Buffett\u2019s role at the Washington Post is widely documented.\u201d15Looking at the story from the reverse side, it\u2019s also clear that the Posthas played a major role for Buffett as well. Finance journalist AndrewKilpatrick, who has followed Buffett\u2019s career for years, believes that theWashington Post Company investment \u201clocked up Buffett\u2019s reputationas a master investor. Berkshire\u2019s holdings are nowworth more than $1 billion, and Buffett\u2019s original investment has in-creased in value more than fiftyfold. Earlier in the year, the share pricetraded as high as $86, then dropped sharply as investors abandoned58 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYCalifornia banks in droves. Buffett, in one corner, wasthe bull, betting $289 million that W ells Fargo would increase in value. Buffetthas continued to add to his position, and by year-end 2003, Berkshireowned more than 56 million shares, with a market value of $4.THE INTELLIGENT INVESTORThe most distinguishing trait of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy is theclear understanding that by owning shares of stocks he owns businesses,not pieces of paper.\u201d Those are, says Buffett, \u201cthe nine most impor-tant words ever written about investing. For Buffett, the activities of a commonstock holder and a business owner are intimately connected. \u201cI am a betterinvestor because I am a businessman,\u201d Buffett says, \u201cand a better busi-nessman because I am an investor.\u201d18THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBusiness Tenets1.", "Warren_Buffett_2003": "293\u201cOur Main BusinessIs Insurance\u201dThe Early Days ofBerkshire HathawayWhen the Buffett Partnership took control of Berkshire Hathawayin 1965, stockholders\u2019 equity had dropped by half and loss fromoperations exceeded $10 million. When Buffett took over, the corporation had $2. By the end of the first year, Buffett had enlarged thesecurities account to $5.Nonetheless, over the next decade Buffett had to come to gripswith certain realities. First, Buffett learned avaluable lesson about corporate turnarounds: They seldom succeed. Thus Warren Buffett had acquired not onlytwo modestly healthy compani es, but a cast-iron vehicle for managinginvestments.Government Employees Insurance CompanyWarren Buffett first became acquainted with GEICO while a studentat Columbia because his mentor, Ben Graham, was a chairman ofits board of directors.32 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett then spent five hours getting an education in the insurancebusiness from the only person working that day: Lorimer Davidson, aninvestment officer who eventually became the company\u2019s CEO.Back home in Omaha and working for his father\u2019s brokerage firm, avery young Warren Buffett wrote a report of GEICO for a financialjournal in which he noted, in what may be the understatement of thatdecade, \u201cThere is reason to believe the major portion of growth liesahead.When the stock price dropped from $61 to $2 a share in 1976,Warren Buffett started buying. Theinsurance company\u2019s impressive performance, and Buffett\u2019s interest inthe company, continued to climb.Despite a rough spot or two, Buffett\u2019s trust in the basic concept ofGEICO has been handsomely rewarded. When Buffett took over the company in 1996, he put in anew incentive system that rewards this focus.\u201d3From the early bargain days of $2 a share in 1976, Buffett paidclose to $70 a share for the rest of the company in 1996. In this perspective\u2014if you want the very best companies, you have to be willing to pay upwhen they become available\u2014Buffett\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger, hasbeen a profound influence.34 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYGeneral Re CorporationIn 1996 Buffett paid $2. This, in fact, was a key part of Buffett\u2019s strategy in buying thecompany.When Buffett acquired it, General Re owned approximately $19billion in bonds, $5 billion in stocks, and $15 billion in float. Some 150 people had beenin charge of deciding where to invest the company\u2019s funds; they were re-placed with just one individual\u2014Warren Buffett. Buffett had realized as early as 1999 thatthe policies were underpriced, and he began working to correct it. Still, Buffett felt able to report in his 2000letter to shar eholders that the situation was improving and he expectedthe upward trend to continue.In a letter to shar eholders that was sent out with the third quarter2001 report, Buffett wrote, \u201cA mega-catastrophe is no surprise. These36 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYcorrective maneuvers were successful. In 2002, after five years of losses,GenRe reported its first underwriting profit, prompting Buffett to an-nounce at the 2002 annual meeting, \u201cW e\u2019re back. Buffettknows that better than most.As he usually does, Buffett credits the company\u2019s managers withrestoring underwriting discipline by setting rational prices for the poli-cies and setting up sufficient reserv es. He re-cently joked that when he joined Berkshire in 1982, he didn\u2019t evenknow how to spell reinsurance, yet Jain has built a tremendously prof-itable operation that earns Buffett\u2019s highest praise year in and year out.\u201d11/tile3Warren Buffett understands the insurance business in a way that fewothers do.38 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYInsurance companies sell a product that is indistinguishable fromthose of competitors. Buffett held firm: Berkshire\u2019s insurance opera-tions would not move into unprofitable territory. Only once\u2014at GeneralRe\u2014did this happen, and it caught Buffett unaware. Ad-ditionally, the ratio of Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio ($35. Since that time, says Buffett,Berkshire has never knowingly wavered from this underwriting disci-pline.12WARREN BUFFETT , 2001\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 39large impact on Berkshire\u2019s overall performance for several years. In a word, the financial in-tegrity that Buffett has imposed on Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies hascreated a franchise in what is otherwise a commodity business. It\u2019s notsurprising that Buffett notes, in his typical straightforward way, \u201cOurmain business is insurance. What Buffett does with thatcash defines him and his company. Running through it all isWarren Buffett\u2019s down-to-earth way of looking at a business: whetherit\u2019s one he\u2019s considering buying in its entirety or one he\u2019s evaluating forstock purchase. This isthe single most important thing to understand about Buffett\u2019s investmentapproach: Buying stocks means buying a business and requires the samediscipline. In fact, it has always been Buffett\u2019s preference to directly owna company, for it permits him to influence what he considers the mostcritical issue in a business: capital allocation.In either case, Buffett follows the same strategy: He looks for com-panies he understands, with consistent earnings history and favorablelong-term prospects, showing good return on equity with little debt,that are operated by honest and competent people, and, importantly, are42 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYavailable at attractive prices. Collectively, they make up what I have called the \u201cWarren BuffettWay,\u201d and they are applied, almost subconsciously, every time he consid-ers buying shares of a company, or acquiring the entire company.Some of these companies, particularly the more recent acquisitions,are jewels that Buffett found in a typically Buffett-like way: He adver-tised for them in the Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.1WARREN BUFFETT , 1994Buying a Business 43good management in place.

Year after year, readers of the Chairman\u2019s Letter in Berkshire\u2019sannual reports find Buffett\u2019s warm words about those who manage thevarious Berkshire companies.The highest compliment Buffett can pay a manager is that he or sheunfailingly behaves and thinks like an owner of the company. Managers82 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwho behave like owners tend not to lose sight of the company\u2019s primeobjective\u2014increasing shareholder value\u2014and they tend to make rationaldecisions that further that goal. Buffett also greatly admires managerswho take seriously their responsibility to report fully and genuinely toshareholders and who have the courage to resist what he has termed theinstitutional imperative \u2014blindly following industry peers. Buffett has always insistedon doing business only with people of the highest integrity. It is a particularly sweet bit ofpoetic justice that Buffett\u2019s stand on corporate integrity now seems tobe a brilliant strategy. And no one has ever seriously accusedWarren Buffett of being naive.Later in this chapter, we look more deeply into Buffett\u2019s responses tothese issues of ethical corpor ate behavior, particularly excessive executivecompensation, stock options, director independence and accountability,and accounting trickery.RATIONALITYThe most important management act, Buffett believes, is allocation ofthe company\u2019s capital.2WARREN BUFFETT , 198683CASE IN POINTSHAW INDUSTRIES , 2000\u20132002In late 2000, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group agreedto acquire 87 percent of Shaw Industries, the world\u2019s largest car-pet manufacturer, for $19 per share, or approximately $2 billion. Buffett paid the premium because the companyhad so many of the qualities he likes to see: The business wassimple and understandable, had a consistent operating history,and exhibited favorable long-term prospects. That translates to excellent long-term prospects,one of Buffett\u2019s requirements.What really attracted Buffett, however, was the company\u2019ssenior management. Deciding what to dowith the company\u2019s earnings\u2014reinvest in the business, or return moneyto shareholders\u2014is, in Buffett\u2019s mind, an exercise in logic and rational-ity. \u201cRationality is the quality that Buffett thinks distinguishes his stylewith which he runs Berkshire\u2014and the quality he often finds lacking inother corporations,\u201d writes Carol Loomis of Fortune. However, Buffett is skeptical of companies that need tobuy growth.)86CASE IN POINTFRUIT OF THE LOOM, 2002In 2002, Warren Buffett bought the core business (apparel) ofbankrupt Fruit of the Loom for $835 million in cash.So why would Warren Buffett be interested.Holland represents a perfect example of the managementqualities Buffett insists upon.In Buffett\u2019s mind, the only reasonable and responsible course forcompanies that have a growing pile of cash that cannot be reinvested atabove-average rates is to return that money to the shareholders. Buffett believes that this is so onlyif investors can get more for their cash than the company could generateif it retained the earnings and reinvested in the company.\u201d890 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwith the shareholders.When management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward istwofold. Buffett\u2019s faith in the company has not di-minished, and he has continued to purchase its stock.\u201d92 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYNext, Golub set financial targets for the company: to increase earn-ings per share by 12 to 15 percent a year and 18 to 20 percent return onequity.\u201d9Graham\u2019s acquisition approach mimics Buffett\u2019s strategy at BerkshireHathaway.Even so, Buffett is convinced that the Post is in better shape thanother media companies. \u201cAs a result,\u201d explains Buffett, \u201cthe shrinkage in the valueof their assets has not been accentuated by the effects of leverage.94 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe Pampered ChefDoris Christopher, the founder, chairman and CEO of the PamperedChef, has allocated her capital well\u2014financing all expansion and growththrough internal earnings. Buffett includes theseparate earnings of each of Berkshire\u2019s businesses and any other addi-tional information that he feels owners would deem valuable when judg-ing a company\u2019s economic performance. Buffett admires CEOs who areable to report to their shareholders in the same candid fashion. According to Buffett, most annual reports are asham. In his annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders, Buffettis open about Berkshire\u2019s economic and management performance,both good and bad.The company also had a division that dealt in trading and derivatives, abusiness Buffett considered unattractive at the time of the merger (al-though, as part of the package, unavoidable) and financially disastrousseveral years later.\u201d1396 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYCritics have argued that Buffett\u2019s practice of publicly admitting hismistakes is made easier because, since he owns such a large share ofBerkshire\u2019s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired. Where some shareholdersmight have panicked, Buffett did not. Still, a manager with strong communication skills should be98 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYable to convince owners to accept a short-term loss in earnings and achange in the direction of their company if it means superior results overtime. Buffett isolates three factors he feels mostinfluence management\u2019s behavior. Lastly, Buffett believes that most man-agers have an exaggerated sense of their own management capabilities. Buffett points out that if the CEO craves a potential ac-quisition requiring a 15 percent return on investment to justify thepurchase, it is amazing how smoothly his troops report back to him thatthe business can actually achieve 15.It is not venality or stupidity, Buffett believes, that positions thesecompanies to fail. Speaking before agroup of Notre Dame students, Buffett displayed a list of thirty-sevenfailed investment banking firms. In many respects, their historically negative100 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYimage is disappearing.Warren Buffett bought Clayton Homes because he saw in JimClayton a hardworking self-starter with strong management skills and alot of smarts. In 1973, if Buffett had invested inGannett, Knight-Ridder, the New York Times, or Times Mirror thesame $10 million he did in the Post, his investment returns would havebeen above average, reflecting the exceptional economics of the news-paper business during this period. But the extra $200-$300 millionin market value that the Washington Post gained over its peer group,102 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett says, \u201ccame, in very large part, from the superior nature of themanagerial decisions made by Kay [Katherine Graham] as compared tothose made by managers of most other media companies.WARREN BUFFETT ON MANAGEMENT, ETHICS,AND RATIONALITYIn all his communications with Berkshire shar eholders, and indeed withthe world at large, Buffett has consistently emphasized his search forhonest and straightforward managers.CEO Avarice and the Institutional ImperativeIn his 2001 letter to shar eholders, Buffett wro te, \u201cCharlie and I are dis-gusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which share-holders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters andother higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away withextraordinary wealth.23WARREN BUFFETT , 1993Investing Guidelines: Management Tenets 103using methods that hid their actions.At Berkshire, Buffett uses a compensation system that rewards man-agers for performance. Buffett believes104 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYthat good unit performance should be rewarded whether Berkshire\u2019sstock price rises or falls. At the end of theyear, Buffett does not hand out stock options\u2014he writes checks. Buffett wrote to CEO Jeff Bezos that it took\u201cparticular courage\u201d and his decision would be \u201crecognized and re-membered.\u201d27A week later, Buffett bought $98. In his 2002 letter to shar eholders, Buffett warned investors to becareful in reading annual reports.28WARREN BUFFETT , 1991 [N OTE THE DATE OF THIS REMARK .]106 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwhich directors are willing to honor their fiduciary responsibility at therisk of displeasing the senior executives.\u201d Buffett illuminates his position bydescribing what he looks for in members of the Berkshire Hathawayboard\u2014\u201cvery high integrity, business savvy, shar eholder orientationand a genuine interest in the company.Buffett would be the first to admit that evaluating managers along histhree dimensions\u2014rationality, candor, and independent thinking\u2014ismore difficult than measuring financial performance, for the simplereason that human beings are more complex than numbers. Buffett offersa few tips.WARREN BUFFETT , 1993W e like to keep things simple, so the chairman can sit aroundand read annual reports.32CHARLIE MUNGER , 1993108 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYI do not mean to say that you should simply give up. It should notsurprise us that Warren Buffett gives us some valuable tips:33\u2022\u201cBeware of companies displaying weak accounting./tile3In conclusion, Buffett wants to work with managers who are straightshooters, who are candid with their shareholders and their employees.I must add my own caution: I cannot promise that following thetenets of the Warren Buffett Way described in this book will protectyou 100 percent. What I can say is this: If you adoptthe careful, thoughtful way of looking at investments that Buffettteaches us and take the time to do your homewo rk, you will be rightmore often than you are wrong, and certainly more often than thosewho allow themselves to be pushed and pulled willy-nilly by headlinesand rumor.1419Investing inFixed-Income SecuritiesWarren Buffett is perhaps best known in the investment worldfor his decisions in common stocks, and he is famous for his\u201cbuy and hold\u201d positions in companies such as Coca-Cola,American Express, the Washington Post, and Gillette. In fact, fixed-income investing is one of Buffett\u2019s regularoutlets, provided\u2014as always\u2014that there are undervalued opportuni-ties.When we look inside these fixed-income transactions, what we seelooks familiar, for Buffett has displayed the same approach that he takeswith investments in stocks. His decisions donot depend on hot trends or market-timing factors but instead are savvyinvestments based on specific opportunities where Buffett believes thereare undervalued assets or securities.142 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThis aspect of Buffett\u2019s investing style doesn\u2019t receive a great deal ofattention in the financial press, but it is a critical part of the overall Berk-shire portfolio. Because of the absolute growth ofthe Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and the changing investment environ-ment, including a lack of publicly traded stocks that he finds attractive,Buffett has often turned to buying entire companies and to acquiringfixed-income securities.\u201dIn that same 2003 letter, Buffett explained that Berkshire wouldcontinue the capital allocation practices it had used in the past: \u201cIf stocksbecome cheaper than entire businesses, then we will buy them aggres-sively.Generally speaking, Buffett has tended to avoid fixed-income invest-ments (outside what was needed for the insurance portfolios) wheneverhe feared impending inflation, which would erode the future purchasingpower of money and therefore the value of bonds. Even though interestrates in the late 1970s and early 1980s approximated the returns of mostbusinesses, Buffett was not a net purchaser of long-term bonds.Even though thinking of Buffett and bonds in the same sentence maybe a new idea for you, it will come as no surprise that he applies the sameprinciples as he does in valuing a company or stocks. The transaction is a clearexample of Buffett\u2019s thinking in terms of the possible gains from buy-ing the bonds compared with those if he bought the entire company. Undismayed, from October1983 through June the following year, Buffett aggressively purchasedbonds issued by WPPSS for Projects 1, 2, and 3. Buffett points out there were few businessesavailable for purchase during this time that were selling at a discount tobook value and earning 16.Buffett figured that if he set out to purchase an unleveraged operatingcompany earning $22. Given a strong business that he understands and likes, Buffettwould have happily paid that amount. Buffett has since sold theWPPSS low-coupon bonds. \u201cMountains of junk bonds,\u201d noted Buffett,\u201cwere sold by those who didn\u2019t care to those that didn\u2019t think and therewas no shortage of either.\u201d4At the height of this debt mania, Buffettpredicted that certain capital enterprises were guaranteed to fail when itbecame apparent that debt-laden companies were struggling to meettheir interest payments.8 billion management-union146 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYled buyout that was to be financed with high-yield bonds, announcedthat it was unable to obtain financing. Buffett analyzed the risks of investing in RJR and concludedthat the company\u2019s credit was higher than perceived by other investorswho were selling their bonds.So, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in dis-counted RJR bonds.Describing his thinking in the 2002 letter to shar eholders, Buffettwrote, \u201cThe Berkshire management does not believe the credit risks as-sociated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly de-clined.What is particularly intriguing about these bond purchases is that, inall likelihood, Buffett would not have bought equity in many of thesecompanies. For his part, Buffettobtained a lucrative (9 percent) investment with an equity position. Atthe time, Buffett was quoted as saying that investors should expect 7 to 8percent returns from the stock market annually, so at 9 percent, he wasahead of the game.There is another aspect to this story that is typical of Buffett\u2014astrong component of managerial integrity and personal relationsh ips. Often148 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYcalled Omaha\u2019s first citizen, Scott was the driving force behind thecity\u2019s zoo, its art museum, the engineering institute, and the NebraskaGame and Parks Foundation.Even though Buffett knew Scott well and held him in high regard,he wanted the investment to be fair and transparent, with no questionthat the relationship between the two men unduly influenced the deal.So Buffett suggested that O.By mid-June 2003, a year later, Buffett, Legg Mason, and LongleafPartners exchanged $500 million for a total of 174 million Level 3 com-mon shares (including an extra 27 million shares as an incentive to con-vert).)Buffett received 36. Sure enough, Level 3 made good on its debt payments,and by the end of 2003, Buffett had doubled his money in 16 months. Buffett bought both.Most analysts at the time said that Qwest\u2019s assets had enough valuefor Buffett to more than recover his investment given the current trad-ing price. The company\u2019s m ost valuable assetwas the 14-state local phone service franchise, but Buffett had faith thatwith former Ameritech CEO, Dick Notebaert, at the helm, the com-pany would solve its problems.comIn July 2002, only one week after Buffett wrote CEO Jeff Bezos a let-ter praising him for his decision to account for stock options as an ex-pense, Buffett bought $98.Buffett clearly appreciates managers who exhibit integrity andstrong values, and he has long advocated for expensing stock options,but he certainly was not on a goodwill mission when he bought theAmazon. Later that summer, Buffett bought anadditional $60.It is well known that Buffett sticks with things he understands andshies away from technology. Buffett may also have observed that Amazon. Buffett admires the way Bezos has created a mega-brand and the way he has pulled the company through some very dif-ficult times.150 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYARBITRAGEArbitrage, in its simplest form, involves purchasing a security in onemarket and simultaneously selling the same security in another market.\u201d7Confronted with more cash than investable ideas, Buffett has oftenturned to arbitrage as a useful way to employ his extra cash. However, whereas most arbitrageurs might participate in fifty ormore deals annually, Buffett sought out only a few, financially largetransactions.Although he never calculated his arbitrage performance over theyears, Buffett estimated that Berkshire has averaged an annual return ofabout 25 percent pretax. Sometimes Buffett holds medium-term, tax-exemptbonds as cash alternatives.With Berkshire\u2019s historical success in arbitrage, shar eholders mightwonder why Buffett strayed from this str ategy.Even before the collapse of the UAL buyout in October 1989, Buffettwas pulling back from arbitrage transactions. Another reason may be thatdeals of a size that would really make a difference to Buffett\u2019s very largeportfolio simply do not exist. However, because the convertiblestock provides high income and has the potential for capital gains, it is152 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYpriced at a premium to the common stock.In the same way that he invested in high-yield bonds, Buffett in-vested in convertible preferred stocks whenever the opportunity pre-sented itself as better than other investments. Buffett, however, certainly did not perceive himself as apro bono savior. It w as, in fact, Scott who initially ap-proached Buffett ; it was the first major deal they had worked on to-gether in their 50 years of friendship.The price Buffett paid for MidAmerican was toward the low end ofthe scale, which according to reports was $34 to $48 per share, so hewas able to achieve a certain discount. Yet Buffett also committed him-self and Berkshire to MidAmerican\u2019s future growth to the extent thatthey would support MidAmerican\u2019s acquisition of pipelines up to $15billion. Buffett paid $960 million, including as-sumption of debt and an additional $1 billion in capital expenses. MidAmerican chair-man Sokol said that without Buffett\u2019s help, the investment would havebeen a strain on MidAmerican.Later that summer, Buffett, along with Lehman Brothers, providedWilliams with a one-year $900 million senior loan at over 19 percent,154 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYsecured by almost all the oil and gas assets of Barrett Resources, whichWilliams originally acquired for about $2. Still, it can be argued that not only was Buffett helping aninvestment-grade company out of a tight spot but also protecting him-self against the high risk of the situation. Buffett believed that the company was worth more than itsthen-current value in the market. Finally, the energy industry can be a stablebusiness, and Buffett was hoping it would become even more stable andprofitable.In MidAmerican, Buffett bought a fixed-income investment withan equity potential. So whether it is blue-chip stocks or high-yield corporate debt, Buffett applies his same principles.Although Buffett is usually thought of as a long-term investor incommon stocks, he has the capability, stamina, and capital to wade intobeleaguered industries and pick out dia monds in the rough.", "Warren_Buffett_1988": "1097Investing GuidelinesFinancial TenetsThe financial tenets by which Buffett values both managerial excel-lence and economic performance are all grounded in some typi-cally Buffett-like principles. For his part, Buffett considers earnings110 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYper share a smoke screen.The test of economic performance, Buffett believes, is whether acompany achieves a high earnings rate on equity capital (\u201cwithout undueleverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.1To measure a company\u2019s annual perfor-mance, Buffett prefers return on equity\u2014the ratio of operating earningsto shareholders\u2019 equity. Buffett excludes all capital gains andlosses as well as any extraordinary items that may increase or decreaseoperating earnings.Furthermore, Buffett believes that a business should achieve goodreturns on equity while employing little or no debt. What Buffettdoes tell us is that a good business should be able to earn a good return onequity without the aid of leverage.112 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBy any measurement, Goizueta\u2019s Coca-Cola was doubling andtripling the financial accomplishments of the previous CEO. According to Buffett, approximately 95 percent of U. Buffett believes thatcash-flow numbers \u201care frequently used by marketers of business and114 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYsecurities to justify the unjustifiable and thereby sell what should be un-salable.Instead of cash flow, Buffett prefers to use what he calls \u201cownerearnings\u201d\u2014a company\u2019s net income plus depreciation, depletion, andamortization, less the amount of capital expenditures and any addi-tional working capital that might be needed. Compare this, says Buffett, with other companiesFigure 7.\u201d116 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYthat have similar earnings but 10 percent corporate expenses; shar ehold-ers lose 9 percent in the value of their holdings simply because of corpo-rate overhead.7 percent; by 1988, when Buffett boughthis Coca-Cola shares, margins had climbed to a record 19 percent.Buffett\u2019s bet had paid off.Buffett believes that if he has selected a company with favorable long-term economic prospects run by able and shar ehold er-oriented managers,the proof will be reflected in the increased market value of the company. If the value118 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYgoes higher than the retained earnings, so much the better. All in all, ex-plains Buffett, \u201cwithin this gigantic auction arena, it is our job to s elect abusiness with economic characteristics allowing each dollar of retainedearnings to be translated into at least a dollar of market value.\u201d9Coca-ColaSince 1988, when Buffett began buying its stock, the price performanceof Coca-Cola has been extraordinary.GilletteFrom 1988, when Buffett first became involved with the company, to1992, the market value of Gillette increased by $9./tile3Looking deep into a company\u2019s financial structure is no easy task, andfor anyone who is not Warren Buffett, it is virtually impossible to learnall these facts when the company is privately held.", "Warren_Buffett_1999": "1WARREN BUFFETT , 1999The Psychology of Money 179the stock market, but themselves.On this point, Buffett is blunt: Unless you can watch your stockholdings decline by 50 percent without becoming panic-stricken, youshould not be in the stock market.

Graham, Buffettsays, was never willing to purchase a stock unless all the facts were in hisfavor. From this experience, Buffett learned that the ability to say no is atremendous advantage for an investor.180 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett believes that too many of today\u2019s investors feel a need to pur-chase too many stocks, most of which are certain to be mediocre, insteadof waiting for the few exceptional companies.Buffett finds it odd that so many people habitually dislike marketsthat are in their best interests and favor those markets that continuallyput them at a disadvantage.3WARREN BUFFETT , 2002The Psychology of Money 181good companies at bargain prices.

It was as ifthe analyses of stocks and of businesses were one and the same.Afterword 201Granted, I had spent the entire day in class analyzing stocks, whichI knew were partial ownership interests in businesses, but I had notmade this most important analytical connection.

But the difference betweenBuffett\u2019s stocks in the 1980s and those same stocks in 1997 wasstriking.

Warren Buffett is sothoroughly identified with the stock market that even peoplewho have no interest in the market know his name and reputation.Others, those who read the financial pages of the newspaper only casu-ally, may know him as the head of an unusual company whose stocksells for upward of $90,000 per share. I mean this in two senses:First, Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to its famous stock portfolio,owns many companies directly. Second, when considering new stockpurchases, Buffett looks at the underlying business as thoroughly as hewould if he were buying the whole company, using a set of basic prin-ciples developed over many years. In this chapter, welook at the first group\u2014the characteristics of the business\u2014and studyhow some of Buffett\u2019s investment decisions reflect those tenets.For Buffett, stocks are an abstraction.2WARREN BUFFETT , 1988Investing Guidelines: Business Tenets 63A SIMPLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE BUSINESSIn Buffett\u2019s view, investors\u2019 financial success is correlated to the degreein which they understand their investment.Over the years, Buffett has owned a vast array of businesses: a gasstation; a farm implementation business; textile companies; a major re-tailer; banks; insurance companies; advertising agencies; aluminum andcement companies; newspapers; oil, mineral, and mining companies;food, beverage, and tobacco companies; t elevision and cable companies. He understands the revenues, expenses, cashflow, labor relations, pricing flexibility, and capital allocation needs ofevery single one of Berkshire\u2019s holdings.\u201cAn investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids64 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYbig mistakes.)65CASE IN POINTBENJAMIN MOORE , 2000In November 2000, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathawaypaid about $1 billion for Benjamin Moore & Co. Thistells us that either Buffett found yet another company that wasundervalued or else that the rest of the investing world was bet-ting on Buffett\u2019s acumen and traded the price up even higher\u2014or both.Buffett also tends to buy companies that have a consistentoperating history and as a result, upon buying a company, he(Continued)66does not expect to have to change much. Just before the Berkshire ac-quisition in 2000, the company underwent a cost-cutting andstreamlining program to improve its operations. In 1969, Berkshirebought 98 percent of the Illinois National Bank and Trust Companyand held it until 1979, when the Bank Holding Act required Berkshireto divest its interest. During that ten-year period, the bank took itsplace beside Berkshire\u2019s other controlled holdings and Buffett reportedits sales and earnings each year in Berkshire\u2019s annual reports. When a company has demonstrated68 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYconsis tent results with the same type of products year after year, it is notunreasonable to assume that those results will continue.6Most individuals, unfortunately, invest as if the opposite weretrue. Too often, they scramble to purchase stocks of companies that arein the midst of a corporate reorganization. For some unexplained reason,says Buffett, these investors are so infatuated with the notion of what to-morrow may bring that they ignore today\u2019s business reality.The Washington Post CompanyBuffett tells Berkshire\u2019s shar eholders that his first f inancial connectionwith the Washington Post was at age 13.FAVORABLE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS\u201cW e like stocks that generate high returns on invested capital,\u201d Buffetttold those in attendance at Berkshire\u2019s 1995 annual meeting, \u201cwherethere is a strong likelihood that it will continue to do so.15WARREN BUFFETT , 199472CASE IN POINTJUSTIN INDUSTRIES , 2000In July 2000, Berkshire Hathaway bought 100 percent of Texas-based Justin Industries for $600 million. It is one of Berkshire\u2019s most in-teresting, and most colorful, acquisitions. And it says a greatdeal about Warren Buffett.Finally, and most especially, Buffett recognized favorable long-term prospects, because of one aspect that he highly admires: inwhat are essentially commodity in dustries, the products haveachieved franchise status. He retired in 1999, butstayed on as chairman emeritus, and that\u2019s why, at the age of 83,it was he who welcomed Warren Buffett to town in April 2000.Two months later, Berkshire Hathaway announced it hadreached an agreement to buy the company, prompting BearStearns analyst Gary Schneider to comment, \u201cThis is goodnews for employees. The mostrecent supply-tight period in Berkshire\u2019s textile division, Buffett quips,lasted the \u201cbetter part of a morning.\u201dThe Coca-Cola CompanyShortly after Berkshire\u2019s 1989 public announcement that it owned 6. In 1980, Robert Woodruff, the company\u2019s 91-year-oldpatriarch, brought him in to correct the problems that had plagued the78 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYcompany during the 1970s.", "Warren_Buffett_Wayname_2003": " Thatone person is Warren Buffett. Even for the dot-com-crazed year 2000, when so much ofthe wealth represented by the Forbes 400 came from the phenomenalgrowth in technology, Buffett, who smilingly eschews high-tech any-thing, was firmly in fourth position.2 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYTo fully appreciate Warren Buffett, however, we have to go be yondthe dollars, the performance accolades, and the reputation.INVESTMENT BEGINNINGSWarren Edward Buffett was born August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska.Buffett attended the business school at the University of Nebraska,and while there, he read a new book on investing by a Columbia profes-sor named Benjamin Graham. During his two-year tenurethere, Buffett became fully immersed in his mentor\u2019s investment approach(see Chapter 2 for a full discussion of Graham\u2019s philosophy).THE BUFFETT PARTNERSHIP , LTD. The limited partners received 6 percent annually onThe World\u2019s Greatest Investor 3their investment and 75 percent of the profits above this bogey; the re-maining 25 percent went to Buffett, who as general partner had essen-tially free rein to invest the partnership\u2019s funds.As Buffett\u2019s reputation grew, more people asked him to managetheir money. For the partnership, Buffett bought controlling interestsin several public and private companies, and in 1962 he began buyingshares in an ailing textile company called Berkshire Hathaway. Fouryears later, explaining that he found the market highly speculative andworthwhile values increasingly scarce, Buffett decided to end the invest-ment partnership. Eventhose with only a passing interest in the stock market recognize Buf fett\u2019s4 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYname and know something of his st unning success. In the followingchapters, we trace the upward trajectory of Berkshire Hathaway in theforty years that Buffett has been in control.THE MAN AND HIS COMPANYWarren Buffett is not easy to describe.When reading Berkshire\u2019s annual reports, one is struck by how com-fortable Buffett is quoting the Bible, John Maynard Keynes, or MaeW est. Buffett is candid in his reporting. It has longbeen Buffett\u2019s goal to increase the book value of Berkshire Hathaway ata 15 percent annual rate\u2014well above the return achieved by the averageAmerican company.4Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2003 Annual Report.8Overall Gain\u20141964\u20132003 259,485 4,743The World\u2019s Greatest Investor 7On a year-by-year basis, Berkshire\u2019s returns have at times beenvolatile; changes in the stock market and thus the underlying stocks thatBerkshire owns create wide swings in per share value (see Table 1.Speaking with the candor for which he is famous, Buffett admittedin the 1999 annual report that \u201ctruly large superiorities over the [S&P]index are a thing of the past.BUFFETT TODAYOver the most recent years, starting in the late 1990s, Buffett has beenless active in the stock market than he was in the 1980s and early 1990s.W e know it is Buffett\u2019s preference to \u201cbuy certainties at a dis-count. When we look down the listof stocks that Buffett owns as well as the wholly owned companies in-side Berkshire, we are struck by the high degree of predictability re-flected there.Knowing that Buffett likes to buy highly predictable economics atprices below the intrinsic value of the business, we can conclude that his8 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYbuyer\u2019s strike reflects the lack of choices in this arena.W e also know Buffett\u2019s discipline of operating only within his \u201ccir-cle of competence.So perhaps Buffett faces a dilemma.W e would be foolish indeed to assume that because the menu ofstocks available for purchase has been reduced, Warren Buffett is leftwithout investment options. Too often, shar eholders forget one of themost important owner-related business principles Buffett outlines eachyear in the annual report. Now, as common stock prices have risen dramati-cally and the purchasing power of Berkshire\u2019s retained earnings hasmushroomed, the strategy of buying whole businesses, which is Buffett\u2019sstated preference, has come to the forefront. W e know that Buffett greatly en-joys his relationships with his operating managers and takes a great dealof pride in Berkshire\u2019s collection of operating businesses.If the economics are not compelling, why would Buffett choose to en-dure the corporate governance fiascos associated with being a majorshareholder.The only activity Buffett involves himself in with Berkshire\u2019s operat-ing businesses is setting executive compensation and allocating the prof-its. The second choice is to take the Buffettapproach to investing, expand your circle of competence by studyingintently the business models of the companies participating in the NewEconomy landscape, and march ahead.", "Investment_Partnership_1929": "In 1926, Graham formed an investment partnership with JeromeNewman. Between them, Graham and Dodd had over fifteen yearsof investment experience. \u201cAn investment operation is one which, upon thoroughanalysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. One was investing only in companies that were within theircircle of competence.The Theory of Investment Value is a genuine classic.CHARLES MUNGERWhen Warren Buffett began his investment partnership in Omaha in1956, he had just over $100,000 in capital to work with. It was the beginning of an extraordinary partnership. In1962, he formed an investment partnership much like Buffett\u2019s, whilemaintaining his law practice.Munger\u2019s investment partnership in Los Angeles, and Buffett\u2019s inOmaha, were similar in approach; both sought to purchase some dis-count to underlying value. Even be-fore Munger joined the Berkshire board, the two made many invest-ment decisions together, often conferring daily; gradually their businessaffairs became more and more interlinked. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shar eholders are blessed inhaving managing partners who look after their interest and help themmake money in all economic environments.Although Graham\u2019s and Fisher\u2019s investment approach differ, notesBuffett, they \u201cparallel in the investment world.\u201d It is the application that separatesBuffett from other investment managers.", "Company_1929": "Security Analysis appeared just a few years after the 1929 stockmarket crash and in the depths of the nation\u2019s worst depression.Fisher\u2019s second touchstone for identifying outstanding companies wasthe quality of management.", "Company_2003": " From 1996 to 2003, thecompany increased its share of market from 2.In April 2003, the company hit a major milestone when it added itsfive-millionth policyholder.

It is the underlying methodology that Warren Buffettuses to evaluate stocks and companies.Buffett condensed Williams\u2019s theory as: \u201cThe value of a business isdetermined by the net cash flows expected to occur over the life of thebusiness discounted at an appropriate interest rate. Buffett\u2019s measuringstick is very straightforward: He uses either the interest rate for long-term (meaning ten-year) U.By using what amounts to a risk-free rate, Buffett has modifiedWilliams\u2019s original thesis. Because he limits his purchases to those withBen Graham\u2019s margin of safety, Buffett ensures that the risk is coveredin the transaction itself, and therefore he believes that using a risk-freerate for discounting is appropriate.Peter Bernstein, in his book Capital Ideas, writes that Graham\u2019ssystem is a set of rules, whereas Williams\u2019s dividend discount model is a22 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYtheory; but \u201cboth approaches end up recommending the same kinds ofstocks for purchase.CHARLES MUNGERWhen Warren Buffett began his investment partnership in Omaha in1956, he had just over $100,000 in capital to work with. When Buffett asked why, Davisreplied, \u201cBecause you remind me of Charlie Munger. In1962, he formed an investment partnership much like Buffett\u2019s, whilemaintaining his law practice. To get a sense of how closely the two are aligned, we haveonly to count the number of times Buffett reports \u201cCharlie and I\u201d didthis, or decided that, or believe this, or looked into that, or think this\u2014almost as if \u201cCharlie-and-I\u201d were the name of one person.16WARREN BUFFETT24 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYIt was Munger who convinced Buffett that paying three timesbook value for See\u2019s Candy was actually a good deal (see Chapter 4for the full story).

Indeed, Buffett\u2019s namebecame synonymous with value investing. He wasthe most famous of Graham\u2019s dedicated students, and Buffett nevermissed an opportunity to acknowledge the intellectual debt he owed toGraham. Even today, Buffett considers Graham to be the one individ-ual, after his father, who had the most influence on his investment life.17How, then, does Buffett reconcile his intellectual indebtedness toGraham with stock purchases like the Washington Post Company (1973)and the Coca-Cola Company (1988). Neither passed Graham\u2019s strictfinancial test for purchase, yet Buffett made significant investmentsin both.As early as 1965, Buffett was becoming aware that Graham\u2019s strategyof buying cheap stocks was not ideal.18Following his mentor\u2019s approachThe Education of Warren Buffett 25of searching for companies that were selling for less than their net work-ing capital, Buffett bought some genuine losers.From his earliest investment mistakes, Buffett began moving awayfrom Graham\u2019s strict teachings. But the margin-of-safety theory thatGraham emphasized was so important to Buffett that he could overlookall other current weaknesses of Graham\u2019s methodology. Even today,Buffett continues to embrace Graham\u2019s primary idea, the theory ofmargin of safety.In addition to the margin-of-safety theory, which became theintellectual framework of Buffett\u2019s thinking, Graham helped Buffettappreciate the folly of following stock market fluctuations. Stocks havean investment characteristic and a speculative characteristic, Graham26 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYtaught, and the speculative characteristics are a consequence of people\u2019sfear and greed.From Graham, Buffett learned how to think independently. Throughoutthe years, Buffett has developed an extensive network of contacts whoassist him in evaluating businesses.Appearing on the PBS show Money World in 1993, Buffettwas asked what investment advice he would give a moneymanager just starting out.\u201d\u201cW ell,\u201d said Buffett, \u201cstart with the A\u2019s.\u201d23The Education of Warren Buffett 27Finally, Fisher t aught Buffett the benefits of focusing on just a fewinvestments.Warren Buffett once said, \u201cI\u2019m 15 percent Fisher and 85 percentBenjamin Graham.

Graham gave Buffett the intel-lectual basis for investing, the margin of safety, and helped Buffett learnhow to master his emotions to take advantage of market fluctuations.Fisher gave Buffett an updated, workable methodology that enabled himto identify good long-term investments and manage a portfolio over thelong term, and taught the value of focusing on just a few good com-panies. Munger helped Buffett appreciate the economic returns that comefrom buying and owning great businesses.

When Buffett took over, the corporation had $2.9 million in mar-ketable securities. By the end of the first year, Buffett had enlarged thesecurities account to $5. First, Buffett learned avaluable lesson about corporate turnarounds: They seldom succeed.THE INSURANCE BUSINESSIn March 1967, Berkshire Hathaway purchased, for $8.6 million, theoutstanding stock of two insurance companies headquartered in Omaha:\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 31National Indemnity Company and National Fire & Marine InsuranceCompany.To appreciate the phenomenon, we must recognize the true value ofowning an insurance company. Sometimes insurance companies are goodinvestments, sometimes not. Thus Warren Buffett had acquired not onlytwo modestly healthy compani es, but a cast-iron vehicle for managinginvestments. At thesame time, the insurance businesses themselves were doing quite well.Buffett\u2019s early success in insurance led him to expand aggressivelyinto this group. Over the next decade, he purchased three additionalinsurance companies and organized five more. As of 2004, Berkshire owns 38 insurance companies, includingtwo giants, the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO)and General Re, each of which has several subsidiaries.Government Employees Insurance CompanyWarren Buffett first became acquainted with GEICO while a studentat Columbia because his mentor, Ben Graham, was a chairman ofits board of directors.32 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett then spent five hours getting an education in the insurancebusiness from the only person working that day: Lorimer Davidson, aninvestment officer who eventually became the company\u2019s CEO.Back home in Omaha and working for his father\u2019s brokerage firm, avery young Warren Buffett wrote a report of GEICO for a financialjournal in which he noted, in what may be the understatement of thatdecade, \u201cThere is reason to believe the major portion of growth liesahead. Theinsurance company\u2019s impressive performance, and Buffett\u2019s interest inthe company, continued to climb. This at a time\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 33when most of the insurance industry struggled with profitability andmost investors stayed away in droves. By year-end 2003, those five million policy-holders had sent in premiums to taling $8. When Buffett took over the company in 1996, he put in anew incentive system that rewards this focus.\u201d3From the early bargain days of $2 a share in 1976, Buffett paidclose to $70 a share for the rest of the company in 1996. In this perspective\u2014if you want the very best companies, you have to be willing to pay upwhen they become available\u2014Buffett\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger, hasbeen a profound influence.Knowing their close working relationship, it\u2019s a fair bet that Mungerhad a lot to say about Berkshire\u2019s other big insurance decision.34 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYGeneral Re CorporationIn 1996 Buffett paid $2. Two years later, he paid seven times that amount\u2014about $16billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock\u2014to acquire a reinsurance companycalled General Re.5Reinsurance is a sector of the insurance industry not well known tothe general public, for it doesn\u2019t deal in the familiar products of life,homeowner \u2019s, or auto insurance. In simplest terms, reinsurers insureother insurance companies. Through a contract that spells out how thepremiums and the losses are to be apportioned, a reinsurer takes on somepercentage of the original company\u2019s risk. This, in fact, was a key part of Buffett\u2019s strategy in buying thecompany.When Buffett acquired it, General Re owned approximately $19billion in bonds, $5 billion in stocks, and $15 billion in float. Some 150 people had beenin charge of deciding where to invest the company\u2019s funds; they were re-placed with just one individual\u2014Warren Buffett. Premiums coming in, remember, will ultimately bepaid to policyholders who have claims. These36 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYcorrective maneuvers were successful. In 2002, after five years of losses,GenRe reported its first underwriting profit, prompting Buffett to an-nounce at the 2002 annual meeting, \u201cW e\u2019re back. That such an experienced hand as Buffett could missthe problems demonstrates the complexity of the insurance industry.The reinsurance industry offers huge potential, and a well-runreinsurance business can create enormous value for shar eholders. So, even though GenRe\u2019s pricing errorscreated problems in the short run, and even though he bought thoseproblems along with the company, this does not negate his basic con-clusion that a well-managed reinsurance company could create greatvalue for Berkshire.As he usually does, Buffett credits the company\u2019s managers withrestoring underwriting discipline by setting rational prices for the poli-cies and setting up sufficient reserv es. The other is also a Berkshire company: theNational Indemnity reinsurance operation.Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupThe National Indemnity insurance operation inside Berkshire today is afar cry from the company that Buffett purchased in 1967.One aspect of National Indemnity that did not exist under itsfounder, Jack Ringwalt, is the reinsurance division.The reinsurance group is headed by Ajit Jain, born in India and ed-ucated at the Indian Institute of Technology and at Harvard. He re-cently joked that when he joined Berkshire in 1982, he didn\u2019t evenknow how to spell reinsurance, yet Jain has built a tremendously prof-itable operation that earns Buffett\u2019s highest praise year in and year out.9Working on the foundation of Berkshire\u2019s financial strength, thereinsurance group is able to write policies that other companies, evenother reinsurers, would shy away from. Commenting on the latter, a vicepresident in the reinsurance division noted, \u201cAs long as the premium ishigher than the odds, we\u2019re comfortable.\u201d10The bulk of underwriting at the reinsurance group is not quite soflashy. In 2003, the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Groupbrought in $4.\u201d11/tile3Warren Buffett understands the insurance business in a way that fewothers do.38 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYInsurance companies sell a product that is indistinguishable fromthose of competitors. Buffett held firm: Berkshire\u2019s insurance opera-tions would not move into unprofitable territory.Unwilling to compete on price, Buffett instead seeks to distinguishBerkshire\u2019s insurance companies in two other ways. Today, in annual revenue and profit, Berkshire\u2019s insurancegroup ranks second, only to AIG, in the property casualty industry. Ad-ditionally, the ratio of Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio ($35. Since that time, says Buffett,Berkshire has never knowingly wavered from this underwriting disci-pline.12WARREN BUFFETT , 2001\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 39large impact on Berkshire\u2019s overall performance for several years.Berkshire\u2019s superior financial strength has distinguished its insuranceoperations from the rest of the industry. When competitors vanish fromthe marketplace because they are frightened by recent losses, Berkshirestands by as a constant supplier of insurance. In a word, the financial in-tegrity that Buffett has imposed on Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies hascreated a franchise in what is otherwise a commodity business. It\u2019s notsurprising that Buffett notes, in his typical straightforward way, \u201cOurmain business is insurance.\u201d13The stream of cash generated by Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations ismind-boggling: some $44.

By the end of the first year, Buffett had enlarged thesecurities account to $5.Nonetheless, over the next decade Buffett had to come to gripswith certain realities.However, Buffett made it clear that he expected the textile groupto earn positive returns on modest capital expenditures. \u201cI won\u2019t closedown a business of subnormal profitability merely to add a fraction of apoint to our corporate returns,\u201d said Buffett. Then, the inevitable: In July 1985, Buffettclosed the books on the textile group, thus ending a business that hadstarted some one hundred years earlier. First, Buffett learned avaluable lesson about corporate turnarounds: They seldom succeed. Sec-ond, the textile group generated enough capital in the earlier years tobuy an insurance company and that is a much brighter story.THE INSURANCE BUSINESSIn March 1967, Berkshire Hathaway purchased, for $8.To appreciate the phenomenon, we must recognize the true value ofowning an insurance company.

At thesame time, the insurance businesses themselves were doing quite well.Buffett\u2019s early success in insurance led him to expand aggressivelyinto this group. As of 2004, Berkshire owns 38 insurance companies, includingtwo giants, the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO)and General Re, each of which has several subsidiaries.Government Employees Insurance CompanyWarren Buffett first became acquainted with GEICO while a studentat Columbia because his mentor, Ben Graham, was a chairman ofits board of directors. A favorite part of the Buffett lore is the now-familiar story of the young student visiting the company\u2019s offices on aSaturday morning and pounding on the door until a janitor let him in.32 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett then spent five hours getting an education in the insurancebusiness from the only person working that day: Lorimer Davidson, aninvestment officer who eventually became the company\u2019s CEO.Back home in Omaha and working for his father\u2019s brokerage firm, avery young Warren Buffett wrote a report of GEICO for a financialjournal in which he noted, in what may be the understatement of thatdecade, \u201cThere is reason to believe the major portion of growth liesahead.

In this perspective\u2014if you want the very best companies, you have to be willing to pay upwhen they become available\u2014Buffett\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger, hasbeen a profound influence.Knowing their close working relationship, it\u2019s a fair bet that Mungerhad a lot to say about Berkshire\u2019s other big insurance decision.34 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYGeneral Re CorporationIn 1996 Buffett paid $2.5Reinsurance is a sector of the insurance industry not well known tothe general public, for it doesn\u2019t deal in the familiar products of life,homeowner \u2019s, or auto insurance.

Premiums coming in, remember, will ultimately bepaid to policyholders who have claims. Buffett had realized as early as 1999 thatthe policies were underpriced, and he began working to correct it. Still, Buffett felt able to report in his 2000letter to shar eholders that the situation was improving and he expectedthe upward trend to continue.In a letter to shar eholders that was sent out with the third quarter2001 report, Buffett wrote, \u201cA mega-catastrophe is no surprise.

In a situation such as this, Buffett\u2019s instinct is to fixthe problems, not unload the company.As he usually does, Buffett credits the company\u2019s managers withrestoring underwriting discipline by setting rational prices for the poli-cies and setting up sufficient reserv es.

That such an experienced hand as Buffett could missthe problems demonstrates the complexity of the insurance industry.The reinsurance industry offers huge potential, and a well-runreinsurance business can create enormous value for shar eholders. So, even though GenRe\u2019s pricing errorscreated problems in the short run, and even though he bought thoseproblems along with the company, this does not negate his basic con-clusion that a well-managed reinsurance company could create greatvalue for Berkshire. The other is also a Berkshire company: theNational Indemnity reinsurance operation.Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupThe National Indemnity insurance operation inside Berkshire today is afar cry from the company that Buffett purchased in 1967.One aspect of National Indemnity that did not exist under itsfounder, Jack Ringwalt, is the reinsurance division. Today, this divi sion,\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 37run from National Indemnity\u2019s office in Stamford, Connecticut, con-tributes powerfully to Berkshire\u2019s revenues.The reinsurance group is headed by Ajit Jain, born in India and ed-ucated at the Indian Institute of Technology and at Harvard.9Working on the foundation of Berkshire\u2019s financial strength, thereinsurance group is able to write policies that other companies, evenother reinsurers, would shy away from. Commenting on the latter, a vicepresident in the reinsurance division noted, \u201cAs long as the premium ishigher than the odds, we\u2019re comfortable.\u201d10The bulk of underwriting at the reinsurance group is not quite soflashy. In the aftermath of September 11,many companies and individuals increased their insurance coverage,often significantly, yet there were no catastrophic losses in the twofollowing years. In 2003, the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Groupbrought in $4.\u201d11/tile3Warren Buffett understands the insurance business in a way that fewothers do. His success derives in large part from ackno wledging the es-sential commodity nature of the industry and elevating his insurancecompanies to the level of a franchise.38 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYInsurance companies sell a product that is indistinguishable fromthose of competitors. Insurance, in other words, is a commodity product. In periods of intense competition, other companies were will-ing to sell insurance policies below the cost of doing business rather thanrisk losing market share.Unwilling to compete on price, Buffett instead seeks to distinguishBerkshire\u2019s insurance companies in two other ways. Today, in annual revenue and profit, Berkshire\u2019s insurancegroup ranks second, only to AIG, in the property casualty industry. The only exception is General Re, and its underpricing had aY ou can always write dumb insurance policies. There is an un-limited market for dumb insurance policies.12WARREN BUFFETT , 2001\u201cOur Main Business Is Insurance\u201d 39large impact on Berkshire\u2019s overall performance for several years.Berkshire\u2019s superior financial strength has distinguished its insuranceoperations from the rest of the industry. When competitors vanish fromthe marketplace because they are frightened by recent losses, Berkshirestands by as a constant supplier of insurance. It\u2019s notsurprising that Buffett notes, in his typical straightforward way, \u201cOurmain business is insurance.\u201d13The stream of cash generated by Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations ismind-boggling: some $44.", "Washington_Post_2003": "\u201d13The Washington Post CompanyThe Washington Post Company today is a media conglomerate withoperations in newspaper publishing, television broadcasting, cable tele-vision systems, magazine publishing, and the provision of educationalservices.

Itis Phil Graham who is credited with transforming the Washington Postfrom a single newspaper into a media and communications company. Bradlee encour-aged Katherine Graham to publish the Pentagon Papers and to pursuethe Watergate investigation, which earned the Washington Post a repu-tation for prizewinning journalism.

In 1983, Buffett paid Mrs., who was still at work44 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYuntil the year she died at the age of 104.\u201d4In January 1986, Buffett paid $315 million in cash for the Scott &Fetzer Company, a conglomerate of twenty-one separate companies, in-cluding the makers of Kirby vacuum cleaners and World Book encyclo-pedia. It was one of Berkshire\u2019s largest business acquisitions up to thatpoint, and has since exceeded Buffett\u2019s own optimistic expectations. It isa model of an organization that creates a large return on equity withvery little debt\u2014and that is one of Buffett\u2019s favorite traits. Since Buffett bought it, Scott Fetzerhas distributed over 100 percent of its earnings back to Berkshire whilesimultaneously increasing its own earnings.In recent years, Warren Buffett has turned more and more of his at-tention to buying companies instead of shares.

Thecompany went public in 1983, and Berkshire Hathaway acquired it inAugust 2003 for $1.The first aspect of the story is that Buffett had some hands-on ex-perience with the industry.\u201d8Buying a Business 47In the fall of 2003, Buffett was invited to attend the University ofTennessee\u2019s MBA Symposium.An efficient, well-run company built on strong principles and show-ing consistent profitability is just what Warren Buffett likes to see. \u201cIn the past some retailers had shunned McLane,\u201d wrote Buffett in48 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYhis 2003 shar eholder letter, \u201cbecause it was owned by their major com-petitor.Recalling that August meeting, Buffett wrote to Berkshire share-holders, \u201cIt took me about ten seconds to decide that these were twomanagers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made adeal.INVESTING IN STOCKSIt is patently obvious that few of us are in a position to buy whole com-panies, as Buffett does.50 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThat same chain of thinking also applies to his decisions about buy-ing stocks, and that does pre sent some examples that ordinary mortalsmight follow. W e may not be able to buy shares on the same scale asWarren Buffett, but we can profit from watching what he does.At the end of 2003, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s common stock portfoliohad a total market value of more than $35 billion (see Table A. In that portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway owns, among oth-ers, 200 million shares of Coca-Cola, 96 million shares of the GilletteCompany, and 56-plus million shares of W ells Fargo & Company. It is one of Buffett\u2019s most strongly held beliefs: Itmakes no sense to invest in a company or an industry you don\u2019t under-stand, because you won\u2019t be able to figure out what it\u2019s worth or totrack what it\u2019s doing.Buffett\u2019s relationship with Coca-Cola dates back to his childhood. For thenext fifty years, Buffett admits, he observed the phenomenal growth ofCoca-Cola, but he purchased textile mills, department stores, and wind-mill and farming equipment manufacturers. It was not until two years later, in thesummer of 1988, that Buffett purchased his first shares of Coca-Cola.The best business to own, says Buffett, is one that over time canemploy large amounts of capital at very high rates of return.Because of this financial strength, and also because the product is sowell known, I use Coca-Cola as the primary example in Chapters 5through 8, which detail the tenets of the Warren Buffett Way.

I mean this in two senses:First, Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to its famous stock portfolio,owns many companies directly. Second, when considering new stockpurchases, Buffett looks at the underlying business as thoroughly as hewould if he were buying the whole company, using a set of basic prin-ciples developed over many years.\u201d1If we go back through time and review all of Buffett\u2019s purchases,looking for the commonalities, we find a set of basic principles, or tenets,62 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYthat have guided his decisions. Two interrelated guidelines about purchase priceNot all of Buffett\u2019s acquisitions will display all the tenets, but takenas a group, these tenets constitute the core of his investment approach. In this chapter, welook at the first group\u2014the characteristics of the business\u2014and studyhow some of Buffett\u2019s investment decisions reflect those tenets.For Buffett, stocks are an abstraction. Buffettconcentrates on learning all he can about the business under considera-tion, focusing on three main areas:1.2WARREN BUFFETT , 1988Investing Guidelines: Business Tenets 63A SIMPLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE BUSINESSIn Buffett\u2019s view, investors\u2019 financial success is correlated to the degreein which they understand their investment.Over the years, Buffett has owned a vast array of businesses: a gasstation; a farm implementation business; textile companies; a major re-tailer; banks; insurance companies; advertising agencies; aluminum andcement companies; newspapers; oil, mineral, and mining companies;food, beverage, and tobacco companies; t elevision and cable companies.Buffett is able to maintain a high level of knowledge about Berk-shire\u2019s businesses because he purposely limits his s elections to companiesthat are within his area of financial and intellectual understanding.\u201d4Critics have argued that Buffett\u2019s self-imposed restrictions excludehim from industries that offer the greatest investment potential, such astechnology.\u201cAn investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids64 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYbig mistakes.\u201d5Producing above-average results, Buffett has learned,often comes from doing ordinary things. Buffett himself was once the circulation manager for theLincoln Journal. It has often been said that if Buffett had not embarkedon a business career, he most surely would have pursued journalism.)65CASE IN POINTBENJAMIN MOORE , 2000In November 2000, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathawaypaid about $1 billion for Benjamin Moore & Co.It was reported that Buffett paid a 25 percent premium overthe stock\u2019s then current price. However, we also know that Buffett is not afraid to payfor quality. Thistells us that either Buffett found yet another company that wasundervalued or else that the rest of the investing world was bet-ting on Buffett\u2019s acumen and traded the price up even higher\u2014or both.Benjamin Moore is just the sort of company Buffett likes.Buffett also tends to buy companies that have a consistentoperating history and as a result, upon buying a company, he(Continued)66does not expect to have to change much.Looking at Benjamin Moore, Buffett also saw a well-runcompany. Buffett\u2019s definition of a franchise is onewhere the product is needed or desired, has no close substitute,and is unregulated.Investing Guidelines: Business Tenets 67In 1969, Buffett bought his first major newspaper, the Omaha Sun,along with a group of weekly papers; from them he learned the businessdynamics of a newspaper. During that ten-year period, the bank took itsplace beside Berkshire\u2019s other controlled holdings and Buffett reportedits sales and earnings each year in Berkshire\u2019s annual reports.Just as Jack Ringwalt helped Buffett understand the intricacy of theinsurance business (see Chapter 3), Gene Abegg, who was chairman ofIllinois National Bank, taught Buffett about the banking business.CONSISTENCYWarren Buffett cares very little for stocks that are \u201chot\u201d at any givenmoment. When a company has demonstrated68 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYconsis tent results with the same type of products year after year, it is notunreasonable to assume that those results will continue. Buffett avoids purchasingcompanies that are fundamentally changing direction because their pre-vious plans were unsuccessful.\u201cSevere change and exceptional returns usually don\u2019t mix,\u201d Buffettobserves. For some unexplained reason,says Buffett, these investors are so infatuated with the notion of what to-morrow may bring that they ignore today\u2019s business reality. \u201cCharlie and I havenot learned how to solve difficult business problems,\u201d Buffett admits.Obviously, Buffett was aware of the newspaper\u2019s rich history. Buffett\u2019s personal experience with the company and its ownsuccessful history led him to believe that the Washington Post was aconsistent and dependable business performer.FAVORABLE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS\u201cW e like stocks that generate high returns on invested capital,\u201d Buffetttold those in attendance at Berkshire\u2019s 1995 annual meeting, \u201cwherethere is a strong likelihood that it will continue to do so.According to Buffett, the economic world is divided into a smallgroup of franchises and a much larger group of commodity businesses,most of which are not worth purchasing.Individually and collectively, these create what Buffett calls a moat\u2014something that gives the company a clear advantage over others and pro-tects it against incursions from the competition. In Buffett\u2019s succinct phrase, \u201cThe definition ofa great company is one that will be great for 25 to 30 years.15WARREN BUFFETT , 199472CASE IN POINTJUSTIN INDUSTRIES , 2000In July 2000, Berkshire Hathaway bought 100 percent of Texas-based Justin Industries for $600 million. And it says a greatdeal about Warren Buffett.In many ways, Justin epitomizes all the business strengthsthat Buffett looks for.Finally, and most especially, Buffett recognized favorable long-term prospects, because of one aspect that he highly admires: inwhat are essentially commodity in dustries, the products haveachieved franchise status. He retired in 1999, butstayed on as chairman emeritus, and that\u2019s why, at the age of 83,it was he who welcomed Warren Buffett to town in April 2000.\u201d19Warren Buffett understands both. Buffett\u2019swell-known preference for simple, low-tech businesses madethis a perfect fit. According toBear Stearns analyst Gary Schneider, there was widespread in-terest from many buyers, including Europeans, but Buffett\u2019swas the first offer the company seriously contemplated. The mostrecent supply-tight period in Berkshire\u2019s textile division, Buffett quips,lasted the \u201cbetter part of a morning.3percent of the Coca-Cola Company, Buffett was interviewed by Mel-lisa Turner, a business writer for the Atlanta Constitution. By way of answer, Buffett related whathe was thinking at the time he finally made the decision. Coca-Cola\u2019s business at-tributes, as described by Buffett, have existed for several decades. In 1980, Robert Woodruff, the company\u2019s 91-year-oldpatriarch, brought him in to correct the problems that had plagued the78 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYcompany during the 1970s.The Washington Post Company\u201cThe economics of a dominant newspaper,\u201d Buffett once wrote, \u201careexcellent, among the very best in the world.Buffett figures that a typical newspaper could double its price and stillretain 90 percent of its readership.At the time Buffett bought McLane, some of the industry players,such as Fleming and U.", "Accusations_Of_Mistreatment_2000": "", "Institutional_Imperative_2002": " Does management resist the institutional imperative.THE INSTITUTIONAL IMPERATIVEIf management stands to gain wisdom and credibility by facing mistakes,why do so many annual reports trumpet only successes. Once out inthe business world, he learned instead that \u201crationality frequently wiltswhen the institutional imperative comes into play.\u201d16Buffett believes that the institutional imperative is responsible forseveral serious, but distressingly common, conditions: \u201c(1) [The organi-zation] resists any change in its current direction; (2) just as work ex-pands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions willmaterialize to soak up available funds; (3) any business craving of theleader, however foolish, will quickly be supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) the behaviorof peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting ex-ecutive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.What is behind the institutional imperative that drives so manybusinesses.

That is the institutional imper-ative at its most destructive.", "Warren_Buffett_On_Management_2002": "816Investing GuidelinesManagement TenetsWhen considering a new investment or a business acquisition,Buffett looks very hard at the quality of management. He tellsus that the companies or stocks Berkshire purchases must beoperated by honest and competent managers whom he can admire andtrust.\u201d1When he finds managers he admires, Buffett is generous with hispraise. Year after year, readers of the Chairman\u2019s Letter in Berkshire\u2019sannual reports find Buffett\u2019s warm words about those who manage thevarious Berkshire companies.The highest compliment Buffett can pay a manager is that he or sheunfailingly behaves and thinks like an owner of the company. Managers82 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwho behave like owners tend not to lose sight of the company\u2019s primeobjective\u2014increasing shareholder value\u2014and they tend to make rationaldecisions that further that goal. Buffett also greatly admires managerswho take seriously their responsibility to report fully and genuinely toshareholders and who have the courage to resist what he has termed theinstitutional imperative \u2014blindly following industry peers. Buffett has always insistedon doing business only with people of the highest integrity. It is a particularly sweet bit ofpoetic justice that Buffett\u2019s stand on corporate integrity now seems tobe a brilliant strategy. And no one has ever seriously accusedWarren Buffett of being naive.Later in this chapter, we look more deeply into Buffett\u2019s responses tothese issues of ethical corpor ate behavior, particularly excessive executivecompensation, stock options, director independence and accountability,and accounting trickery.RATIONALITYThe most important management act, Buffett believes, is allocation ofthe company\u2019s capital.2WARREN BUFFETT , 198683CASE IN POINTSHAW INDUSTRIES , 2000\u20132002In late 2000, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group agreedto acquire 87 percent of Shaw Industries, the world\u2019s largest car-pet manufacturer, for $19 per share, or approximately $2 billion. Buffett paid the premium because the companyhad so many of the qualities he likes to see: The business wassimple and understandable, had a consistent operating history,and exhibited favorable long-term prospects. That translates to excellent long-term prospects,one of Buffett\u2019s requirements.What really attracted Buffett, however, was the company\u2019ssenior management.Clearly, Bob Shaw managed his company well, and in away that fits neatly with Buffett\u2019s approach. Deciding what to dowith the company\u2019s earnings\u2014reinvest in the business, or return moneyto shareholders\u2014is, in Buffett\u2019s mind, an exercise in logic and rational-ity. \u201cRationality is the quality that Buffett thinks distinguishes his stylewith which he runs Berkshire\u2014and the quality he often finds lacking inother corporations,\u201d writes Carol Loomis of Fortune. Itis at this crossroad that Buffett keenly focuses on management. However, Buffett is skeptical of companies that need tobuy growth.)86CASE IN POINTFRUIT OF THE LOOM, 2002In 2002, Warren Buffett bought the core business (apparel) ofbankrupt Fruit of the Loom for $835 million in cash.So why would Warren Buffett be interested.Holland represents a perfect example of the managementqualities Buffett insists upon.In Buffett\u2019s mind, the only reasonable and responsible course forcompanies that have a growing pile of cash that cannot be reinvested atabove-average rates is to return that money to the shareholders. Buffett believes that this is so onlyif investors can get more for their cash than the company could generateif it retained the earnings and reinvested in the company.\u201d890 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwith the shareholders. The ultim ate test of owners\u2019 faith is allowingmanagement to reinvest 100 percent of earnings; Berkshire\u2019s owners\u2019faith in Buffett is high.When management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward istwofold.Furthermore, says Buffett, when executives actively buy the com-pany\u2019s stock in the market, they are demonstrating that they have thebest interests of their owners at hand rather than a careless need to ex-pand the corporate structure. Buffett\u2019s faith in the company has not di-minished, and he has continued to purchase its stock. In the early 1990s, it wasgenerating more cash than it needed for operations\u2014the very point atwhich management actions collide with Buffett\u2019s acid test.\u201d92 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYNext, Golub set financial targets for the company: to increase earn-ings per share by 12 to 15 percent a year and 18 to 20 percent return onequity.That summer, Buffett had converted Berkshire\u2019s holdings in pre-ferred stock to common, and soon thereafter, he began to acquire evenmore. InMarch 1995, Buffett added another 20 million shares; in 1997, another49. Aswe know, Buffett prefers to have companies return excess earnings toshareholders.\u201d9Graham\u2019s acquisition approach mimics Buffett\u2019s strategy at BerkshireHathaway.Even so, Buffett is convinced that the Post is in better shape thanother media companies. \u201cAs a result,\u201d explains Buffett, \u201cthe shrinkage in the valueof their assets has not been accentuated by the effects of leverage.94 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe Pampered ChefDoris Christopher, the founder, chairman and CEO of the PamperedChef, has allocated her capital well\u2014financing all expansion and growththrough internal earnings.\u201cWhat needs to be reported,\u201d Buffett insists, \u201cis data\u2014whetherGAAP, non-GAAP, or extra GAAP\u2014that helps the financially literatereaders answer three key questions: (1) Approximately how much isthis company worth. Buffett includes theseparate earnings of each of Berkshire\u2019s businesses and any other addi-tional information that he feels owners would deem valuable when judg-ing a company\u2019s economic performance. Buffett admires CEOs who areable to report to their shareholders in the same candid fashion. According to Buffett, most annual reports are asham. In his annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders, Buffettis open about Berkshire\u2019s economic and management performance,both good and bad.The company also had a division that dealt in trading and derivatives, abusiness Buffett considered unattractive at the time of the merger (al-though, as part of the package, unavoidable) and financially disastrousseveral years later.\u201d1396 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYCritics have argued that Buffett\u2019s practice of publicly admitting hismistakes is made easier because, since he owns such a large share ofBerkshire\u2019s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired. But it does not diminish the fundamental value of Buffett\u2019sbelief that candor benefits the manager at least as much as it benefits theshareholder. Where some shareholdersmight have panicked, Buffett did not. TheInvesting Guidelines: Management Tenets 97answer, Buffett has learned, is an unseen force he calls \u201cthe institutionalimperative\u201d\u2014the lemminglike tendency of corporate management toimitate the behavior of other managers, no matter how silly or irrationalthat behavior may be. Still, a manager with strong communication skills should be98 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYable to convince owners to accept a short-term loss in earnings and achange in the direction of their company if it means superior results overtime. Inability to resist the institutional imperative, Buffett has learned,often has less to do with the owners of the company than the willingnessof its managers to accept fundamental change. Buffett isolates three factors he feels mostinfluence management\u2019s behavior. Lastly, Buffett believes that most man-agers have an exaggerated sense of their own management capabilities. Buffett points out that if the CEO craves a potential ac-quisition requiring a 15 percent return on investment to justify thepurchase, it is amazing how smoothly his troops report back to him thatthe business can actually achieve 15.It is not venality or stupidity, Buffett believes, that positions thesecompanies to fail. Speaking before agroup of Notre Dame students, Buffett displayed a list of thirty-sevenfailed investment banking firms. In many respects, their historically negative100 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYimage is disappearing.Warren Buffett bought Clayton Homes because he saw in JimClayton a hardworking self-starter with strong management skills and alot of smarts. In 1973, if Buffett had invested inGannett, Knight-Ridder, the New York Times, or Times Mirror thesame $10 million he did in the Post, his investment returns would havebeen above average, reflecting the exceptional economics of the news-paper business during this period. But the extra $200-$300 millionin market value that the Washington Post gained over its peer group,102 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett says, \u201ccame, in very large part, from the superior nature of themanagerial decisions made by Kay [Katherine Graham] as compared tothose made by managers of most other media companies.WARREN BUFFETT ON MANAGEMENT, ETHICS,AND RATIONALITYIn all his communications with Berkshire shar eholders, and indeed withthe world at large, Buffett has consistently emphasized his search forhonest and straightforward managers. Executive compensation, stock options, director inde-pendence, accounting trickery\u2014these issues strike a very personal chordwith Buffett, and he does not hesitate to let us know how he feels.CEO Avarice and the Institutional ImperativeIn his 2001 letter to shar eholders, Buffett wro te, \u201cCharlie and I are dis-gusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which share-holders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters andother higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away withextraordinary wealth.23WARREN BUFFETT , 1993Investing Guidelines: Management Tenets 103using methods that hid their actions.\u201d24The accounting scandals set off alarm bells ac ross the United States,especially for anyone who held stock in a company 401(k) pl an.\u201d He wrote, \u201cOverreaching by CEOs greatly accelerated in the1990s as compensation packages gained by the most avaricious\u2014a titlefor which there was vigorous competition\u2014were promptly replicatedelsewhere. In Buffett\u2019s mind, even if your team wins thepennant, you don\u2019t pay a .At Berkshire, Buffett uses a compensation system that rewards man-agers for performance. Buffett believes104 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYthat good unit performance should be rewarded whether Berkshire\u2019sstock price rises or falls. At the end of theyear, Buffett does not hand out stock options\u2014he writes checks.Even when stock options are treated as a legitimate aspect of exec-utive compensation, Buffett cautions us to watch how they are ac-counted for on a company\u2019s balance sheet. In his 2003 letter to shar eholders, he wro te, \u201cWhen CEOsor their representatives meet with compensation committees, too oftenone side\u2014the CEO\u2019s\u2014has cared far more than the other about whatbargain is struck.

However, Buffett is skeptical of companies that need tobuy growth.)86CASE IN POINTFRUIT OF THE LOOM, 2002In 2002, Warren Buffett bought the core business (apparel) ofbankrupt Fruit of the Loom for $835 million in cash. With thepurchase, Berkshire acquired two strong assets: an outstandingmanager and one of the country\u2019s best-known and best-lovedbrand names.(Continued)88He explained his thinking to Berkshire shar eholders: \u201cJohnHolland was responsible for Fruit\u2019s operations in its most boun-tiful years. That means the company ended 2001 with operating earn-ings of $70.Over the years, Berkshire Hathaway has earned very high returnsfrom its capital and has retained all its earnings.Not surprisingly, Berkshire does not pay a dividend.\u201d890 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwith the shareholders. The ultim ate test of owners\u2019 faith is allowingmanagement to reinvest 100 percent of earnings; Berkshire\u2019s owners\u2019faith in Buffett is high.When management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward istwofold.Furthermore, says Buffett, when executives actively buy the com-pany\u2019s stock in the market, they are demonstrating that they have thebest interests of their owners at hand rather than a careless need to ex-pand the corporate structure. Since then, the company hasrepurchased more than 1 billion shares.In July 1992, the company announced that through the year 2000, itwould buy back 100 million shares of its stock, representing 7.6 percentof the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Buffett\u2019s faith in the company has not di-minished, and he has continued to purchase its stock.\u201d92 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYNext, Golub set financial targets for the company: to increase earn-ings per share by 12 to 15 percent a year and 18 to 20 percent return onequity.That summer, Buffett had converted Berkshire\u2019s holdings in pre-ferred stock to common, and soon thereafter, he began to acquire evenmore. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned 27 million shares. At the end of 2003, Berk-shire owned more than 151 million shares of American Express stock,nearly 12 percent of the company, with a market value of more than $7billion\u2014seven times what Buffett paid for it. Aswe know, Buffett prefers to have companies return excess earnings toshareholders. Between 1975 and 1991, the companybought an unbelievable 43 percent of its shares at an average price of $60per share.\u201d9Graham\u2019s acquisition approach mimics Buffett\u2019s strategy at BerkshireHathaway.\u201cWhat needs to be reported,\u201d Buffett insists, \u201cis data\u2014whetherGAAP, non-GAAP, or extra GAAP\u2014that helps the financially literatereaders answer three key questions: (1) Approximately how much isthis company worth. Buffett includes theseparate earnings of each of Berkshire\u2019s businesses and any other addi-tional information that he feels owners would deem valuable when judg-ing a company\u2019s economic performance. In his annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders, Buffettis open about Berkshire\u2019s economic and management performance,both good and bad. Through the years, he has admitted the difficultiesthat Berkshire encountered in both the textile and insurance businessesand his own management failures with these businesses.The company also had a division that dealt in trading and derivatives, abusiness Buffett considered unattractive at the time of the merger (al-though, as part of the package, unavoidable) and financially disastrousseveral years later.\u201d1396 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYCritics have argued that Buffett\u2019s practice of publicly admitting hismistakes is made easier because, since he owns such a large share ofBerkshire\u2019s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired. Where some shareholdersmight have panicked, Buffett did not. Today, Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies stilloperate on this principle.

Year after year, readers of the Chairman\u2019s Letter in Berkshire\u2019sannual reports find Buffett\u2019s warm words about those who manage thevarious Berkshire companies.The highest compliment Buffett can pay a manager is that he or sheunfailingly behaves and thinks like an owner of the company. Managers82 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwho behave like owners tend not to lose sight of the company\u2019s primeobjective\u2014increasing shareholder value\u2014and they tend to make rationaldecisions that further that goal. Buffett also greatly admires managerswho take seriously their responsibility to report fully and genuinely toshareholders and who have the courage to resist what he has termed theinstitutional imperative \u2014blindly following industry peers. Buffett has always insistedon doing business only with people of the highest integrity. It is a particularly sweet bit ofpoetic justice that Buffett\u2019s stand on corporate integrity now seems tobe a brilliant strategy. And no one has ever seriously accusedWarren Buffett of being naive.Later in this chapter, we look more deeply into Buffett\u2019s responses tothese issues of ethical corpor ate behavior, particularly excessive executivecompensation, stock options, director independence and accountability,and accounting trickery.RATIONALITYThe most important management act, Buffett believes, is allocation ofthe company\u2019s capital.2WARREN BUFFETT , 198683CASE IN POINTSHAW INDUSTRIES , 2000\u20132002In late 2000, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group agreedto acquire 87 percent of Shaw Industries, the world\u2019s largest car-pet manufacturer, for $19 per share, or approximately $2 billion. Buffett paid the premium because the companyhad so many of the qualities he likes to see: The business wassimple and understandable, had a consistent operating history,and exhibited favorable long-term prospects. That translates to excellent long-term prospects,one of Buffett\u2019s requirements.What really attracted Buffett, however, was the company\u2019ssenior management.Clearly, Bob Shaw managed his company well, and in away that fits neatly with Buffett\u2019s approach. Deciding what to dowith the company\u2019s earnings\u2014reinvest in the business, or return moneyto shareholders\u2014is, in Buffett\u2019s mind, an exercise in logic and rational-ity. \u201cRationality is the quality that Buffett thinks distinguishes his stylewith which he runs Berkshire\u2014and the quality he often finds lacking inother corporations,\u201d writes Carol Loomis of Fortune.

Buffett believes that this is so onlyif investors can get more for their cash than the company could generateif it retained the earnings and reinvested in the company.\u201d890 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYwith the shareholders.Furthermore, says Buffett, when executives actively buy the com-pany\u2019s stock in the market, they are demonstrating that they have thebest interests of their owners at hand rather than a careless need to ex-pand the corporate structure.\u201d92 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYNext, Golub set financial targets for the company: to increase earn-ings per share by 12 to 15 percent a year and 18 to 20 percent return onequity. Aswe know, Buffett prefers to have companies return excess earnings toshareholders.\u201d9Graham\u2019s acquisition approach mimics Buffett\u2019s strategy at BerkshireHathaway.Even so, Buffett is convinced that the Post is in better shape thanother media companies. \u201cAs a result,\u201d explains Buffett, \u201cthe shrinkage in the valueof their assets has not been accentuated by the effects of leverage.94 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe Pampered ChefDoris Christopher, the founder, chairman and CEO of the PamperedChef, has allocated her capital well\u2014financing all expansion and growththrough internal earnings. Buffett includes theseparate earnings of each of Berkshire\u2019s businesses and any other addi-tional information that he feels owners would deem valuable when judg-ing a company\u2019s economic performance. Buffett admires CEOs who areable to report to their shareholders in the same candid fashion. In his annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders, Buffettis open about Berkshire\u2019s economic and management performance,both good and bad.The company also had a division that dealt in trading and derivatives, abusiness Buffett considered unattractive at the time of the merger (al-though, as part of the package, unavoidable) and financially disastrousseveral years later.\u201d1396 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYCritics have argued that Buffett\u2019s practice of publicly admitting hismistakes is made easier because, since he owns such a large share ofBerkshire\u2019s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired. Where some shareholdersmight have panicked, Buffett did not. Still, a manager with strong communication skills should be98 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYable to convince owners to accept a short-term loss in earnings and achange in the direction of their company if it means superior results overtime. Buffett isolates three factors he feels mostinfluence management\u2019s behavior. Lastly, Buffett believes that most man-agers have an exaggerated sense of their own management capabilities. Buffett points out that if the CEO craves a potential ac-quisition requiring a 15 percent return on investment to justify thepurchase, it is amazing how smoothly his troops report back to him thatthe business can actually achieve 15.It is not venality or stupidity, Buffett believes, that positions thesecompanies to fail. Speaking before agroup of Notre Dame students, Buffett displayed a list of thirty-sevenfailed investment banking firms. In many respects, their historically negative100 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYimage is disappearing.Warren Buffett bought Clayton Homes because he saw in JimClayton a hardworking self-starter with strong management skills and alot of smarts. But the extra $200-$300 millionin market value that the Washington Post gained over its peer group,102 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett says, \u201ccame, in very large part, from the superior nature of themanagerial decisions made by Kay [Katherine Graham] as compared tothose made by managers of most other media companies.WARREN BUFFETT ON MANAGEMENT, ETHICS,AND RATIONALITYIn all his communications with Berkshire shar eholders, and indeed withthe world at large, Buffett has consistently emphasized his search forhonest and straightforward managers. Executive compensation, stock options, director inde-pendence, accounting trickery\u2014these issues strike a very personal chordwith Buffett, and he does not hesitate to let us know how he feels.CEO Avarice and the Institutional ImperativeIn his 2001 letter to shar eholders, Buffett wro te, \u201cCharlie and I are dis-gusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which share-holders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters andother higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away withextraordinary wealth.23WARREN BUFFETT , 1993Investing Guidelines: Management Tenets 103using methods that hid their actions.\u201d24The accounting scandals set off alarm bells ac ross the United States,especially for anyone who held stock in a company 401(k) pl an.

Even though interestrates in the late 1970s and early 1980s approximated the returns of mostbusinesses, Buffett was not a net purchaser of long-term bonds. An insurancecompany heavily invested in bonds in a hyperinflationary environmenthas the potential to wipe out its portfolio.BONDSWashington Public Power Supply SystemBack in 1983, Buffett decided to invest in some bonds of the Washing-ton Public Power Supply System (WPPSS). That decision ledto the largest municipal bond default in U. The size of thedefault and the debacle that followed depressed the market for publicpower bonds for several years.Buffett evaluated the risks of owning municipal bonds of WPPSSProjects 1, 2, and 3. Certainly there was a risk that these bonds coulddefault and a risk that the interest payments could be suspended for aprolonged period. Still another factor was the upside ceiling on whatthese bonds could ever be worth. The lowest coupon bonds of Projects 1,2, and 3 sank to forty cents on the dollar and produced a current yield of15 to 17 percent tax-free. The highest coupon bonds fell to eighty centson the dollar and generated a similar yield. Indeed, the bonds outperformedmost business acquisitions made in 1983. Buffett has since sold theWPPSS low-coupon bonds. These bonds, which he purchased at aInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 145significant discount to par value, doubled in price while annually pay-ing Berkshire a return of 15 to 17 percent tax-free. The formal name is high-yield bond, but most in-vestors, then and now, call them junk bonds.In Buffett\u2019s view, these new high-yield bonds were different fromtheir predecessor \u201cfallen angels\u201d\u2014Buffett\u2019s term for investment-gradebonds that, having fallen on bad times, were downgraded by ratingsagencies. The WPPSS bonds were fallen angels. He described the newhigh-yield bonds as a bastardized form of the fallen angels and, he said,were junk before they were issued.Wall Street\u2019s securities salespeople were able to promote the legiti-macy of junk bond investing by quoting earlier research that indicatedhigher interest rates compensated investors for the risk of default. Buf-fett argued that earlier default statistics were meaningless since theywere based on a group of bonds that differed significantly from the junkbonds currently being issued.\u201d3As the 1980s unfolded, high-yield bonds became junkier as new of-ferings flooded the market. \u201cMountains of junk bonds,\u201d noted Buffett,\u201cwere sold by those who didn\u2019t care to those that didn\u2019t think and therewas no shortage of either.

Portfolio managers began dumpingtheir junk bond positions. Without any buyers, the price for high-yield bonds plummeted. After beginning the year with outstandinggains, Merrill Lynch\u2019s index of high-yield bonds returned a paltry 4. By the end of 1989, junk bonds were deeply out of favor withthe market. Although RJR Nabisco was meeting its financialobligations, when the junk bond market unrav eled, RJR bonds de-clined along with other junk bonds. In 1989 and 1990, during the junkbond bear market, Buffett began purchasing RJR bonds.Most junk bonds continued to look unattractive during this time, butBuffett figured RJR Nabisco was unjustly punished. RJR bonds were yielding 14.So, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in dis-counted RJR bonds. In the spring of 1991, RJR Nabisco announced itwas retiring most of its junk bonds by redeeming them at face value.

If the common stockdeclines, the higher yield of the convertible preferred stock prevents itfrom falling as low as the common shares.A convertible preferred stock also provides the investor with the op-portunity to participate in the upside potential of the common shares. However, because the convertiblestock provides high income and has the potential for capital gains, it is152 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYpriced at a premium to the common stock. This premium is reflected inthe rate at which the preferred is convertible into common shares. Thismeans that the common must rise in price 20 to 30 percent beforethe convertible stock can be converted into common shares without los-ing value.In the same way that he invested in high-yield bonds, Buffett in-vested in convertible preferred stocks whenever the opportunity pre-sented itself as better than other investments. In the late 1980s and1990s, Buffett made several investments in convertible preferred stocks,including Salomon Brothers, Gillet te, USAir, Champion International,and American Express.Some of the companies issuing the convertible preferred securitieswere familiar to Buffett, but in other cases he had no special insight aboutthe business nor could he predict with any confidence what its future cashflows would be. This unpredictability, Buffett explains, is the precise rea-son Berkshire\u2019s investment was a convertible preferred issue rather thancommon stock. This is a multifaceted trans-action involving convertible preferred and common stock as well as debt.MidAmericanOn March 14, 2000, Berkshire acquired 34.56 million shares of con-vertible preferred stock along with 900,942 shares of common stock inMidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, a Des Moines-based gas andelectric utility, for approximately $1.05 per share.Two years later, in March 2002, Berkshire bought 6.7 million moreshares of the convertible preferred stock for $402 million.728 million of 11 percent nontransferabletrust preferred securities, of which $150 million were redeemed inAugust 2003., bought $275 million of Williams\u2019s preferred stock.This preferred stock does not generally vote with the common stock inthe election of directors, but in this deal Berkshire Hathaway gained theright to elect 20 percent of MidAmerican\u2019s board as well as rights of ap-proval over certain important transactions./tile3It is important to remember that Buffett thinks of convertible preferredstocks first as fixed-income securities and second as vehicles for appre-ciation. Hence the value of Berkshire\u2019s preferred stocks cannot be anyless than the value of a similar nonconvertible preferred and, because ofconversion rights, is probably more.", "Warren_Buffett_Wayarbitragearbitrage_2002": "1419Investing inFixed-Income SecuritiesWarren Buffett is perhaps best known in the investment worldfor his decisions in common stocks, and he is famous for his\u201cbuy and hold\u201d positions in companies such as Coca-Cola,American Express, the Washington Post, and Gillette. In fact, fixed-income investing is one of Buffett\u2019s regularoutlets, provided\u2014as always\u2014that there are undervalued opportuni-ties.When we look inside these fixed-income transactions, what we seelooks familiar, for Buffett has displayed the same approach that he takeswith investments in stocks. His decisions donot depend on hot trends or market-timing factors but instead are savvyinvestments based on specific opportunities where Buffett believes thereare undervalued assets or securities.142 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThis aspect of Buffett\u2019s investing style doesn\u2019t receive a great deal ofattention in the financial press, but it is a critical part of the overall Berk-shire portfolio. Because of the absolute growth ofthe Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and the changing investment environ-ment, including a lack of publicly traded stocks that he finds attractive,Buffett has often turned to buying entire companies and to acquiringfixed-income securities.\u201dIn that same 2003 letter, Buffett explained that Berkshire wouldcontinue the capital allocation practices it had used in the past: \u201cIf stocksbecome cheaper than entire businesses, then we will buy them aggres-sively.Generally speaking, Buffett has tended to avoid fixed-income invest-ments (outside what was needed for the insurance portfolios) wheneverhe feared impending inflation, which would erode the future purchasingpower of money and therefore the value of bonds. Even though interestrates in the late 1970s and early 1980s approximated the returns of mostbusinesses, Buffett was not a net purchaser of long-term bonds.Even though thinking of Buffett and bonds in the same sentence maybe a new idea for you, it will come as no surprise that he applies the sameprinciples as he does in valuing a company or stocks. The transaction is a clearexample of Buffett\u2019s thinking in terms of the possible gains from buy-ing the bonds compared with those if he bought the entire company.Buffett evaluated the risks of owning municipal bonds of WPPSSProjects 1, 2, and 3. Undismayed, from October1983 through June the following year, Buffett aggressively purchasedbonds issued by WPPSS for Projects 1, 2, and 3.Buffett figured that if he set out to purchase an unleveraged operatingcompany earning $22. Given a strong business that he understands and likes, Buffettwould have happily paid that amount. But, he points out, Berkshire paidhalf that price for WPPSS bonds to realize the same amount of earnings.Looking back, Buffett admits that the purchase of WPPSS bondsturned out better than he expected. Buffett has since sold theWPPSS low-coupon bonds. These bonds, which he purchased at aInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 145significant discount to par value, doubled in price while annually pay-ing Berkshire a return of 15 to 17 percent tax-free. \u201cMountains of junk bonds,\u201d noted Buffett,\u201cwere sold by those who didn\u2019t care to those that didn\u2019t think and therewas no shortage of either.\u201d4At the height of this debt mania, Buffettpredicted that certain capital enterprises were guaranteed to fail when itbecame apparent that debt-laden companies were struggling to meettheir interest payments.8 billion management-union146 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYled buyout that was to be financed with high-yield bonds, announcedthat it was unable to obtain financing. Buffett analyzed the risks of investing in RJR and concludedthat the company\u2019s credit was higher than perceived by other investorswho were selling their bonds.So, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in dis-counted RJR bonds.Describing his thinking in the 2002 letter to shar eholders, Buffettwrote, \u201cThe Berkshire management does not believe the credit risks as-sociated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly de-clined.What is particularly intriguing about these bond purchases is that, inall likelihood, Buffett would not have bought equity in many of thesecompanies. For his part, Buffettobtained a lucrative (9 percent) investment with an equity position. Atthe time, Buffett was quoted as saying that investors should expect 7 to 8percent returns from the stock market annually, so at 9 percent, he wasahead of the game.Even though Buffett knew Scott well and held him in high regard,he wanted the investment to be fair and transparent, with no questionthat the relationship between the two men unduly influenced the deal.So Buffett suggested that O.By mid-June 2003, a year later, Buffett, Legg Mason, and LongleafPartners exchanged $500 million for a total of 174 million Level 3 com-mon shares (including an extra 27 million shares as an incentive to con-vert). Sure enough, Level 3 made good on its debt payments,and by the end of 2003, Buffett had doubled his money in 16 months. Buffett bought both.Most analysts at the time said that Qwest\u2019s assets had enough valuefor Buffett to more than recover his investment given the current trad-ing price.comIn July 2002, only one week after Buffett wrote CEO Jeff Bezos a let-ter praising him for his decision to account for stock options as an ex-pense, Buffett bought $98. Later that summer, Buffett bought anadditional $60. Buffett may also have observed that Amazon. Buffett admires the way Bezos has created a mega-brand and the way he has pulled the company through some very dif-ficult times.150 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYARBITRAGEArbitrage, in its simplest form, involves purchasing a security in onemarket and simultaneously selling the same security in another market.To evaluate risk arbitrage opportunities, explains Buffett, you mustanswer four basic questions.\u201d7Confronted with more cash than investable ideas, Buffett has oftenturned to arbitrage as a useful way to employ his extra cash. However, whereas most arbitrageurs might participate in fifty ormore deals annually, Buffett sought out only a few, financially largetransactions.Although he never calculated his arbitrage performance over theyears, Buffett estimated that Berkshire has averaged an annual return ofabout 25 percent pretax. Because arbitrage is often a substitute forshort-term Treasury bills, Buffett\u2019s appetite for deals fluctuated withBerkshire\u2019s cash level.Investing in Fixed-Income Securities 151Nowadays, however, he does not engage in arbitrage on a largescale but rather keeps his excess cash in Treasuries and other short-termliquid investments. Sometimes Buffett holds medium-term, tax-exemptbonds as cash alternatives. But because these tax-free bonds offer higher aftertax returns than Treasury bills, Buffett fig-ures that the potential loss is offset by the gain in income.With Berkshire\u2019s historical success in arbitrage, shar eholders mightwonder why Buffett strayed from this str ategy.Even before the collapse of the UAL buyout in October 1989, Buffettwas pulling back from arbitrage transactions. However, because the convertiblestock provides high income and has the potential for capital gains, it is152 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYpriced at a premium to the common stock.In the same way that he invested in high-yield bonds, Buffett in-vested in convertible preferred stocks whenever the opportunity pre-sented itself as better than other investments. This unpredictability, Buffett explains, is the precise rea-son Berkshire\u2019s investment was a convertible preferred issue rather thancommon stock.Here, Buffett values the convertible preferred for its fixed-income re-turn as well as for its future equity stake.The price Buffett paid for MidAmerican was toward the low end ofthe scale, which according to reports was $34 to $48 per share, so hewas able to achieve a certain discount. Yet Buffett also committed him-self and Berkshire to MidAmerican\u2019s future growth to the extent thatthey would support MidAmerican\u2019s acquisition of pipelines up to $15billion. Buffett paid $960 million, including as-sumption of debt and an additional $1 billion in capital expenses. MidAmerican chair-man Sokol said that without Buffett\u2019s help, the investment would havebeen a strain on MidAmerican.Later that summer, Buffett, along with Lehman Brothers, providedWilliams with a one-year $900 million senior loan at over 19 percent,154 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYsecured by almost all the oil and gas assets of Barrett Resources, whichWilliams originally acquired for about $2. Still, it can be argued that not only was Buffett helping aninvestment-grade company out of a tight spot but also protecting him-self against the high risk of the situation. Buffett believed that the company was worth more than itsthen-current value in the market.In MidAmerican, Buffett bought a fixed-income investment withan equity potential./tile3It is important to remember that Buffett thinks of convertible preferredstocks first as fixed-income securities and second as vehicles for appre-ciation. So whether it is blue-chip stocks or high-yield corporate debt, Buffett applies his same principles.Although Buffett is usually thought of as a long-term investor incommon stocks, he has the capability, stamina, and capital to wade intobeleaguered industries and pick out dia monds in the rough.", "Yield_Bonds_2002": " If selected bonds become attractive, as they did in 2002, we willagain load up on these securities.

In fact, fixed-income investing is one of Buffett\u2019s regularoutlets, provided\u2014as always\u2014that there are undervalued opportuni-ties.When we look inside these fixed-income transactions, what we seelooks familiar, for Buffett has displayed the same approach that he takeswith investments in stocks. His decisions donot depend on hot trends or market-timing factors but instead are savvyinvestments based on specific opportunities where Buffett believes thereare undervalued assets or securities.142 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThis aspect of Buffett\u2019s investing style doesn\u2019t receive a great deal ofattention in the financial press, but it is a critical part of the overall Berk-shire portfolio. Fixed-income securities represented 20 percent of Berk-shire\u2019s investment portfolio in 1992; today, 14 years later, that percentagehas grown to about 30 percent. Because of the absolute growth ofthe Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and the changing investment environ-ment, including a lack of publicly traded stocks that he finds attractive,Buffett has often turned to buying entire companies and to acquiringfixed-income securities.\u201dIn that same 2003 letter, Buffett explained that Berkshire wouldcontinue the capital allocation practices it had used in the past: \u201cIf stocksbecome cheaper than entire businesses, then we will buy them aggres-sively.)\u201d1To some extent, fixed-income investments will always be necessaryfor Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio because of Berkshire\u2019s concentrationin insurance companies. Still, Berkshire holds a significantly smaller percentage offixed-income securities in its insurance investment portfolio comparedwith other insurance companies.Generally speaking, Buffett has tended to avoid fixed-income invest-ments (outside what was needed for the insurance portfolios) wheneverhe feared impending inflation, which would erode the future purchasingpower of money and therefore the value of bonds. Even though interestrates in the late 1970s and early 1980s approximated the returns of mostbusinesses, Buffett was not a net purchaser of long-term bonds. In thatkind of environment, common stocks would have lost real value, butInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 143bonds outstanding would have suffered far greater losses. An insurancecompany heavily invested in bonds in a hyperinflationary environmenthas the potential to wipe out its portfolio.Even though thinking of Buffett and bonds in the same sentence maybe a new idea for you, it will come as no surprise that he applies the sameprinciples as he does in valuing a company or stocks. This \u201cbond-as-a-business\u201d approach to fixed-income in-vesting is highly unusual but it has served Buffett well.BONDSWashington Public Power Supply SystemBack in 1983, Buffett decided to invest in some bonds of the Washing-ton Public Power Supply System (WPPSS). The transaction is a clearexample of Buffett\u2019s thinking in terms of the possible gains from buy-ing the bonds compared with those if he bought the entire company.Buffett evaluated the risks of owning municipal bonds of WPPSSProjects 1, 2, and 3. Undismayed, from October1983 through June the following year, Buffett aggressively purchasedbonds issued by WPPSS for Projects 1, 2, and 3. By the end of June1984, Berkshire Hathaway owned $139 million of WPPSS Project 1, 2,and 3 bonds (both low-coupon and high-coupon) with a face value of$205 million.With WPPSS, explains Buffett, Berkshire acquired a $139 millionbusiness that could expect to earn $22. Buffett points out there were few businessesavailable for purchase during this time that were selling at a discount tobook value and earning 16.Buffett figured that if he set out to purchase an unleveraged operatingcompany earning $22. Given a strong business that he understands and likes, Buffettwould have happily paid that amount. But, he points out, Berkshire paidhalf that price for WPPSS bonds to realize the same amount of earnings.Looking back, Buffett admits that the purchase of WPPSS bondsturned out better than he expected. Buffett has since sold theWPPSS low-coupon bonds. These bonds, which he purchased at aInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 145significant discount to par value, doubled in price while annually pay-ing Berkshire a return of 15 to 17 percent tax-free.In Buffett\u2019s view, these new high-yield bonds were different fromtheir predecessor \u201cfallen angels\u201d\u2014Buffett\u2019s term for investment-gradebonds that, having fallen on bad times, were downgraded by ratingsagencies.Wall Street\u2019s securities salespeople were able to promote the legiti-macy of junk bond investing by quoting earlier research that indicatedhigher interest rates compensated investors for the risk of default. \u201cMountains of junk bonds,\u201d noted Buffett,\u201cwere sold by those who didn\u2019t care to those that didn\u2019t think and therewas no shortage of either.\u201d4At the height of this debt mania, Buffettpredicted that certain capital enterprises were guaranteed to fail when itbecame apparent that debt-laden companies were struggling to meettheir interest payments.8 billion management-union146 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYled buyout that was to be financed with high-yield bonds, announcedthat it was unable to obtain financing. Portfolio managers began dumpingtheir junk bond positions. In 1989 and 1990, during the junkbond bear market, Buffett began purchasing RJR bonds. Buffett analyzed the risks of investing in RJR and concludedthat the company\u2019s credit was higher than perceived by other investorswho were selling their bonds.So, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in dis-counted RJR bonds.Level 3 CommunicationsIn 2002, Buffett bought up large bundles of other high-yield corporatebonds, increasing his holdings in these securities sixfold to $8.Investing in Fixed-Income Securities 147Of the total, 65 percent were in the energy industry and about $7 bil-lion were bought through Berkshire insurance companies.Describing his thinking in the 2002 letter to shar eholders, Buffettwrote, \u201cThe Berkshire management does not believe the credit risks as-sociated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly de-clined.What is particularly intriguing about these bond purchases is that, inall likelihood, Buffett would not have bought equity in many of thesecompanies. For his part, Buffettobtained a lucrative (9 percent) investment with an equity position. Atthe time, Buffett was quoted as saying that investors should expect 7 to 8percent returns from the stock market annually, so at 9 percent, he wasahead of the game.There is another aspect to this story that is typical of Buffett\u2014astrong component of managerial integrity and personal relationsh ips.Even though Buffett knew Scott well and held him in high regard,he wanted the investment to be fair and transparent, with no questionthat the relationship between the two men unduly influenced the deal.By mid-June 2003, a year later, Buffett, Legg Mason, and LongleafPartners exchanged $500 million for a total of 174 million Level 3 com-mon shares (including an extra 27 million shares as an incentive to con-vert).)Buffett received 36.3 million sharesfor $92. Sure enough, Level 3 made good on its debt payments,and by the end of 2003, Buffett had doubled his money in 16 months.On top of that, his bonds had earned $45 million of interest, and he stillheld on to 1,644,900 of Level 3\u2019s shares. Buffett bought both.Most analysts at the time said that Qwest\u2019s assets had enough valuefor Buffett to more than recover his investment given the current trad-ing price. The company\u2019s m ost valuable assetwas the 14-state local phone service franchise, but Buffett had faith thatwith former Ameritech CEO, Dick Notebaert, at the helm, the com-pany would solve its problems.comIn July 2002, only one week after Buffett wrote CEO Jeff Bezos a let-ter praising him for his decision to account for stock options as an ex-pense, Buffett bought $98.Buffett clearly appreciates managers who exhibit integrity andstrong values, and he has long advocated for expensing stock options,but he certainly was not on a goodwill mission when he bought theAmazon.com bonds.4 million profiton the investment in high-yield bonds, a 17 percent return in ninemonths if Amazon repurchased the $264 million in 10 percent seniornotes that were issued in 1998. Later that summer, Buffett bought anadditional $60. Buffett may also have observed that Amazon. Buffett admires the way Bezos has created a mega-brand and the way he has pulled the company through some very dif-ficult times.150 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYARBITRAGEArbitrage, in its simplest form, involves purchasing a security in onemarket and simultaneously selling the same security in another market.To evaluate risk arbitrage opportunities, explains Buffett, you mustanswer four basic questions.\u201d7Confronted with more cash than investable ideas, Buffett has oftenturned to arbitrage as a useful way to employ his extra cash. However, whereas most arbitrageurs might participate in fifty ormore deals annually, Buffett sought out only a few, financially largetransactions.Although he never calculated his arbitrage performance over theyears, Buffett estimated that Berkshire has averaged an annual return ofabout 25 percent pretax. Because arbitrage is often a substitute forshort-term Treasury bills, Buffett\u2019s appetite for deals fluctuated withBerkshire\u2019s cash level.Investing in Fixed-Income Securities 151Nowadays, however, he does not engage in arbitrage on a largescale but rather keeps his excess cash in Treasuries and other short-termliquid investments. Sometimes Buffett holds medium-term, tax-exemptbonds as cash alternatives. But because these tax-free bonds offer higher aftertax returns than Treasury bills, Buffett fig-ures that the potential loss is offset by the gain in income.With Berkshire\u2019s historical success in arbitrage, shar eholders mightwonder why Buffett strayed from this str ategy.Even before the collapse of the UAL buyout in October 1989, Buffettwas pulling back from arbitrage transactions. However, because the convertiblestock provides high income and has the potential for capital gains, it is152 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYpriced at a premium to the common stock.In the same way that he invested in high-yield bonds, Buffett in-vested in convertible preferred stocks whenever the opportunity pre-sented itself as better than other investments. In the late 1980s and1990s, Buffett made several investments in convertible preferred stocks,including Salomon Brothers, Gillet te, USAir, Champion International,and American Express.Some of the companies issuing the convertible preferred securitieswere familiar to Buffett, but in other cases he had no special insight aboutthe business nor could he predict with any confidence what its future cashflows would be. This unpredictability, Buffett explains, is the precise rea-son Berkshire\u2019s investment was a convertible preferred issue rather thancommon stock.Here, Buffett values the convertible preferred for its fixed-income re-turn as well as for its future equity stake. This broughtInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 153Berkshire\u2019s holdings to over 9 percent voting interest and just over 80percent economic interest in MidAmerican.The price Buffett paid for MidAmerican was toward the low end ofthe scale, which according to reports was $34 to $48 per share, so hewas able to achieve a certain discount. Yet Buffett also committed him-self and Berkshire to MidAmerican\u2019s future growth to the extent thatthey would support MidAmerican\u2019s acquisition of pipelines up to $15billion. Buffett paid $960 million, including as-sumption of debt and an additional $1 billion in capital expenses. MidAmerican chair-man Sokol said that without Buffett\u2019s help, the investment would havebeen a strain on MidAmerican.In another but related transaction, a Berkshire subsidiary, MEHCInvestment Inc.Later that summer, Buffett, along with Lehman Brothers, providedWilliams with a one-year $900 million senior loan at over 19 percent,154 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYsecured by almost all the oil and gas assets of Barrett Resources, whichWilliams originally acquired for about $2. Still, it can be argued that not only was Buffett helping aninvestment-grade company out of a tight spot but also protecting him-self against the high risk of the situation.Although MidAmerican was not Buffett\u2019s only foray into the then-beleaguered energy industry, it definitely was a complex, multifacetedinvestment. Buffett believed that the company was worth more than itsthen-current value in the market. Finally, the energy industry can be a stablebusiness, and Buffett was hoping it would become even more stable andprofitable.In MidAmerican, Buffett bought a fixed-income investment withan equity potential. In total, the company hadabout $19 billion of assets and $6 billion in annual revenues from 25states and several other countries, and was yielding Berkshire Hathawayabout $300 million per year./tile3It is important to remember that Buffett thinks of convertible preferredstocks first as fixed-income securities and second as vehicles for appre-ciation.Investing in Fixed-Income Securities 155Buffett is widely regarded as the world\u2019s greatest value investor,which basically means buying stocks, bonds, and other securities, andwhole companies, for a great deal less than their real worth, and waitinguntil the asset value is realized. So whether it is blue-chip stocks or high-yield corporate debt, Buffett applies his same principles.Although Buffett is usually thought of as a long-term investor incommon stocks, he has the capability, stamina, and capital to wade intobeleaguered industries and pick out dia monds in the rough. In 2002, Berkshire\u2019s grossrealized gain from fixed-income investments was $1 billion.", "Bonds_2002": " In recent years, this has includedforays into the debt market, including corporate and governmentbonds, convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, and even high-yielding junk bonds. If selected bonds become attractive, as they did in 2002, we willagain load up on these securities.BONDSWashington Public Power Supply SystemBack in 1983, Buffett decided to invest in some bonds of the Washing-ton Public Power Supply System (WPPSS). That decision ledto the largest municipal bond default in U. The size of thedefault and the debacle that followed depressed the market for publicpower bonds for several years.Buffett evaluated the risks of owning municipal bonds of WPPSSProjects 1, 2, and 3. Certainly there was a risk that these bonds coulddefault and a risk that the interest payments could be suspended for aprolonged period. Still another factor was the upside ceiling on whatthese bonds could ever be worth. The lowest coupon bonds of Projects 1,2, and 3 sank to forty cents on the dollar and produced a current yield of15 to 17 percent tax-free. The highest coupon bonds fell to eighty centson the dollar and generated a similar yield. Indeed, the bonds outperformedmost business acquisitions made in 1983. Buffett has since sold theWPPSS low-coupon bonds. These bonds, which he purchased at aInvesting in Fixed-Income Securities 145significant discount to par value, doubled in price while annually pay-ing Berkshire a return of 15 to 17 percent tax-free. The WPPSS bonds were fallen angels.Wall Street\u2019s securities salespeople were able to promote the legiti-macy of junk bond investing by quoting earlier research that indicatedhigher interest rates compensated investors for the risk of default.\u201d3As the 1980s unfolded, high-yield bonds became junkier as new of-ferings flooded the market. In 1989, Southmark Corporation and Inte-grated Resources both defaulted on their bonds. Portfolio managers began dumpingtheir junk bond positions. Without any buyers, the price for high-yield bonds plummeted. After beginning the year with outstandinggains, Merrill Lynch\u2019s index of high-yield bonds returned a paltry 4. By the end of 1989, junk bonds were deeply out of favor withthe market. Although RJR Nabisco was meeting its financialobligations, when the junk bond market unrav eled, RJR bonds de-clined along with other junk bonds. RJR bonds were yielding 14.So, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in dis-counted RJR bonds. In the spring of 1991, RJR Nabisco announced itwas retiring most of its junk bonds by redeeming them at face value. As the high-yield market skyrock-eted, some of the bonds were called or sold.\u201dIn July 2002, three companies invested a total of $500 million inBroomfield, Colorado-based Level 3 Communications\u2019 ten-year con-vertible bonds, with a coupon of 9 percent and a conversion price of$3.On top of that, his bonds had earned $45 million of interest, and he stillheld on to 1,644,900 of Level 3\u2019s shares.

Warren Buffett called it \u201cThe Great Bubble. The residue of the three-year bear market of2000 through 2002 left many with a particularly bitter taste in their190 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmouths. Buffett, the exception,has not suffered periods of mediocrity. As investors andspeculators alike have been distracted by esoteric approaches to investing,Buffett has quietly amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune.Given the documented success of Buffett\u2019s performance coupledwith the simplicity of his methodology, the more appropriate questionis, why don\u2019t other investors apply his approach.When Buffett invests, he sees a business.While other professional investors are busy studying capital assetpricing models, beta, and modern portfolio theory, Buffett studiesincome statements, capital reinvestment requirements, and the cash-generating capabilities of his companies.2WARREN BUFFETT , 1990The Unreasonable Man 191a wide variety of businesses in many industries separates Buffett fromall other professional investors.\u201d Buffett asks.\u201d3According to Buffett, the investor and the businessperson shouldlook at the company in the same way, because they both want essentiallythe same thing.If adapting Buffett\u2019s investment strategy required o nly changingperspective, then probably more investors would become pro ponents.4WARREN BUFFETT , 1988192 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett believes it is foolish to use short-term prices to judge a com-pany\u2019s success.INVESTING THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe major goal of this book is to help investors understand and employthe investment strategies that have made Buffett successful. Perhaps in the future you may seeexamples of \u201cBuffett-like\u201d purchases and will be in a position to profitfrom his teachings. investors who know how to think and act like Buffett will berewarded.The Warren Buffett Way is deceptively simple. \u201cWhat we do is notbeyond anybody els e\u2019s competence,\u201d says Buffett.\u201d5The Unreasonable Man 193The irony is that Buffett\u2019s success lies partly in the failure of others. But the gap between Buffett and other pro-fessional investors is widened by their own willingness to play a loser\u2019sgame that Buffett chooses not to play.Whether you are financially able to purchase 10 percent of a com-pany or merely one hundred shares, the Warren Buffett Way can help youachieve profitable investment returns. In the Warren Buffett Way, the first step is the mostchallenging.Buffett does not have a stock quote machine in his office and heseems to get by just fine without it. If you plan on owning shares in an194 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYoutstanding business for a number of years, what happens in the marketon a day-to-day basis is inconsequential.\u201cAfter we buy a stock, we would not be disturbed if markets closedfor a year or two,\u201d says Buffett. Y ou know you have approached Buffett\u2019s level whenyour attention turns to the stock market and the only question on yourmind is: \u201cHas anybody done an ything foolish lately that will give me anopportunity to buy a good business at a great price. Buffettconsiders this thinking to be foolish.Buffett prefers to buy a business that has the opportunity to profitin any economy. Macroeconomic forces may affect returns on the mar-gin, but overall, Buffett\u2019s businesses are able to profit nicely despite va-garies in the economy. But if Buffett were given the same test, hewould begin by methodically measuring the business against his basictenets, one by one:\u2022 Is the business simple and understandable, with a consistent oper-ating history and favorable long-term prospects. Take note:Only at this final step does Buffett look at the stock market price. Buffett deals with this problem in two ways. Because you are no longer196 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmeasuring your success solely by price change or comparing annual pricechange to a common stock benchmark, you have the liberty to s elect thebest businesses available.Buffett believes that wide diversification is required only when in-vestors do not understand what they are doing. Buffettasks you to consider: If the best business you own presents the least fi-nancial risk and has the most favorable long-term prospects, why wouldyou put money into your twentieth favorite business instead of addingmoney to the top choice. In Buffett\u2019s mind, it istoo difficult to make hundreds of smart decisions in a lifetime.The Essence of Warren BuffettThe driving force of Warren Buffett\u2019s investment strategy is the rationalallocation of capital. Buffett\u2019s success is the result of locating that line ofreason and never deviating from its path.Buffett has had his share of failures and no doubt will have a fewmore in the years ahead.The Warren Buffett Way is no different.When Buffett purchases stocks, he focuses on two simple variables:the price of the business and its value. The WarrenBuffett Way is not beyond the comprehension of most serious investors. In fact, the more you enter into a dialogue onprice and value, the more you will begin to understand and appreciatethe Warren Buffett Way.8WARREN BUFFETT , 1993198 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett, over his lifetime, has tried different investment gambits. Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digitinterest rates, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes. \u201cOur (investment)attitude,\u201d said Buffett, \u201cfits our personalities and the way we want to liveour lives.\u201d8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ). As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow\u2019s class.\u201cWarren Buffett,\u201d she cheerily reminded us, \u201cwas Benjamin Graham\u2019smost famous student, you know. And true tohis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to knowabout the economics of these businesses, and more. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealedthe inner nature of investing. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then Icollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett Icould find. My goalwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share thoseinsights with my clients. Byfollowing Buffett\u2019s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clientsmore investment success than failure.202 AFTERWORDAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews\u2014an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. As a broker, I was getting the \u201cbuy\u201d part of the equation right,but Buffett\u2019s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the\u201csell\u201d part of the equation more difficult.It was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett downon paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment ap-proach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, hadbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it cer-tainly couldn\u2019t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became thebasis for The Warren Buffett Way.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions. I wanted toAfterword 203demonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, iffollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns. Armed with theknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,coupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of thoseyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieveabove-average results.I even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway.Because my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett\u2019s teachings,perhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfoliowere stocks Buffett himself had purchased. If I continued to invest inthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to gen-erate just average results. I knew if I contin-ued to own the same stocks Buffett owned in his portfolio at theseelevated pric es, coupled with moderating economics, I was unlikely togenerate above-average investment results for my shar eholders.There were questions about whether Buffett could compete against thenewer industries and still provide above-average results.I knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was stillvalid. After The Warren Buffett Way was published, we circled backfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navi-gating the economic landscape.In the book, I pointed out that Buffett did not rely solely on lowP/E ratios to s elect stocks. I told him Buffett\u2019s investment ap-proach was solid. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased.One of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was themistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech com-panies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett\u2019s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. A few have taken Buffett\u2019s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The im-portant takeaway is this: Buffett\u2019s investment approach is applicable to alltypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitaliza-tion, regardless of where the business is domiciled.Afterword 209A common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Super-investors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,or those who lead the funds that Michael\u2019s research identified, is a port-folio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and astock-selection proc ess that emphasizes the discovery of a stock\u2019s intrin-sic value. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his phi-losophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world ofinvesting.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios.Those who follow Buffett\u2019s way will still analyze stocks (and com-panies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;and will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett\u2019s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.90Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1995 Annual Report.20Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1996 Annual Report.50Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1997 Annual Report.

If you plan on owning shares in an194 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYoutstanding business for a number of years, what happens in the marketon a day-to-day basis is inconsequential.\u201cAfter we buy a stock, we would not be disturbed if markets closedfor a year or two,\u201d says Buffett.\u201d7Buffett is telling us that he does not need the market\u2019s prices to vali-date Berkshire\u2019s common stock investments. Y ou know you have approached Buffett\u2019s level whenyour attention turns to the stock market and the only question on yourmind is: \u201cHas anybody done an ything foolish lately that will give me anopportunity to buy a good business at a great price.\u2022 Are the company\u2019s economics in good shape\u2014with highprofit margins, owners\u2019 earnings, and increased market value thatmatches retained earnings. Take note:Only at this final step does Buffett look at the stock market price. Because you are no longer196 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmeasuring your success solely by price change or comparing annual pricechange to a common stock benchmark, you have the liberty to s elect thebest businesses available. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ). As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow\u2019s class.It began with a salutation To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath-away Inc.\u201dThe next fourteen pages outlined Berkshire\u2019s major business holdingsincluding Nebraska Furniture Mart, Buffalo Evening News, See\u2019s CandyShops, and the Government Employees Insurance Company. He listed the commonstocks held in Berkshire\u2019s insurance portfolio, including Affiliated Publi-cations, General Foods, Ogilvy & Mather, R. I was immediately struck by how seamlesslyBuffett moved back and forth between describing the stocks in the port-folio and the business attributes of Berkshire\u2019s major holdings. When Iread the Berkshire Hathaway report I saw businesses, with products andcustomers. As I continued to read the Berkshire report, the entireworld of investing, which was still somewhat mysterious to me, beganto open. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews\u2014an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions. First, whenI started the fund, I populated the portfolio mostly with BerkshireHathaway-type stocks: newspapers, beverage companies, other con-sumer nondurable businesses, and selected financial service companies.I even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway. But the difference betweenBuffett\u2019s stocks in the 1980s and those same stocks in 1997 wasstriking. If I continued to invest inthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to gen-erate just average results. Even Buffett was telling Berkshire Hathawayshareholders they could no lon ger expect to earn the above-average in-vestment gains the company had achieved in the past. Sometimes a stock with a low P/E ratio did generatecash and achieve high returns on capital and subsequently became a greatinvestment. Other times, a stock with a low P/E ratio consumed cashAfterword 205and generated below-average returns on capital and so became a poorinvestment. What is thecompany\u2019s return on capital. Although Bill\u2019s fund owns companies that are dif-ferent from those in Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, no one candeny that they are approaching the investment process in the same way. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned. Several prominent investors havebought stocks not found anywhere in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. Each one employed a business valuation process to determinewhether stocks were mispriced.Michael Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Legg MasonCapital Management, conducted a study of the b est-performing mutualfunds between 1992 and 2002.1He screened for funds that had onemanager during the period, had assets of at least $1 billion, and beat theStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index over the ten-year period. On average, the outperforming mutual fundsplaced 37 percent of their assets in their top ten names.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios. When he added the new economic franchises to Berkshire\u2019sportfolio in the 1970s and 1980s, he was still thinking about stocks asbusinesses and managing a focused portfolio. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett\u2019s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.1 Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,300 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 33,4011,969,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 33,033592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 17,187220,000 Capital Cities Communications, Inc. 778 6,039Total $ 71,893 $139,081All other common stocks 34,996 41,992Total common stocks $106,889 $181,073Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Annual Report.2 Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,000 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 43,4451,986,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 28,314953,750 SAFECO Corporation 23,867 26,467592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 19,0391,066,934 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. 18,085 18,671453,800 Knight-Ridder Newspapers 7,534 10,2671,294,308 GEICO Common Stock 4,116 9,060246,450 American Broadcasting Companies 6,082 8,626Total $ 94,260 $163,889All other common stocks 39,506 57,040Total common stocks $133,766 $220,929Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Annual Report.3 Berkshire Hathaway 1979 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value5,730,114 GEICO Corp. 4,545 7,345112,545 Amerada Hess 2,861 5,487Total $156,738 $297,994All other common stocks 28,675 36,686Total common stocks $185,413 $334,680Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1979 Annual Report.4 Berkshire Hathaway 1980 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value7,200,000 GEICO Corporation $ 47,138 $105,3001983,812 General Foods 62,507 59,8892,015,000 Handy & Harman 21,825 58,4351,250,525 SAFECO Corporation 32,063 45,1771,868,600 The Washington Post Company 10,628 42,277464,317 Aluminum Company of America 25,577 27,6851,211,834 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp.

The distinctions between money managers faded. Determining how to allocate a company\u2019s earningsis the most important decision a manager will make.\u201d8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984.

Legg Mason Capital Management is the secondlargest shar eholder in Amazon.1He screened for funds that had onemanager during the period, had assets of at least $1 billion, and beat theStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index over the ten-year period.Still, with all the evidence on how to generate above-average longresults, a vast majority of money managers continue to underperformthe stock market.Perhaps with the intense competition among money managers, stocksare more accurately priced. \u201cThat the S&P 500 has also beaten other active moneymanagers is not an argument against active money management,\u201d saidBill Miller; \u201cit is an argument against the methods employed by mostactive money managers.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.

The WarrenBuffett Way is not beyond the comprehension of most serious investors. In fact, the more you enter into a dialogue onprice and value, the more you will begin to understand and appreciatethe Warren Buffett Way.8WARREN BUFFETT , 1993198 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett, over his lifetime, has tried different investment gambits. Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digitinterest rates, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes. \u201cOur (investment)attitude,\u201d said Buffett, \u201cfits our personalities and the way we want to liveour lives.\u201d8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ). As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow\u2019s class.\u201cWarren Buffett,\u201d she cheerily reminded us, \u201cwas Benjamin Graham\u2019smost famous student, you know. And true tohis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to knowabout the economics of these businesses, and more. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealedthe inner nature of investing.The next morning, I was bursting with a newly discovered passionfor investing, and when the training class was completed, I quickly re-turned to Philadelphia with a single-minded purpose: I was going to in-vest my clients\u2019 money in the same fashion as did Warren Buffett. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then Icollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett Icould find. My goalwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share thoseinsights with my clients. Byfollowing Buffett\u2019s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clientsmore investment success than failure.202 AFTERWORDAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews\u2014an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. As a broker, I was getting the \u201cbuy\u201d part of the equation right,but Buffett\u2019s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the\u201csell\u201d part of the equation more difficult.It was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett downon paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment ap-proach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, hadbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it cer-tainly couldn\u2019t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became thebasis for The Warren Buffett Way.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions. I wanted toAfterword 203demonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, iffollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns. Armed with theknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,coupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of thoseyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieveabove-average results.Because my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett\u2019s teachings,perhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfoliowere stocks Buffett himself had purchased. If I continued to invest inthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to gen-erate just average results. Even Buffett was telling Berkshire Hathawayshareholders they could no lon ger expect to earn the above-average in-vestment gains the company had achieved in the past. I knew if I contin-ued to own the same stocks Buffett owned in his portfolio at theseelevated pric es, coupled with moderating economics, I was unlikely togenerate above-average investment results for my shar eholders.There were questions about whether Buffett could compete against thenewer industries and still provide above-average results.I knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was stillvalid. After The Warren Buffett Way was published, we circled backfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navi-gating the economic landscape.In the book, I pointed out that Buffett did not rely solely on lowP/E ratios to s elect stocks. I told him Buffett\u2019s investment ap-proach was solid. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased.One of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was themistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech com-panies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett\u2019s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. A few have taken Buffett\u2019s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities.Afterword 209A common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Super-investors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,or those who lead the funds that Michael\u2019s research identified, is a port-folio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and astock-selection proc ess that emphasizes the discovery of a stock\u2019s intrin-sic value. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his phi-losophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world ofinvesting.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios.Those who follow Buffett\u2019s way will still analyze stocks (and com-panies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;and will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett\u2019s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.90Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1995 Annual Report.20Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1996 Annual Report.50Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1997 Annual Report.

Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digitinterest rates, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes. \u201cOur (investment)attitude,\u201d said Buffett, \u201cfits our personalities and the way we want to liveour lives.\u201d8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ). As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow\u2019s class.\u201cWarren Buffett,\u201d she cheerily reminded us, \u201cwas Benjamin Graham\u2019smost famous student, you know. Here Buffett outlined the company\u2019s major business princi-ples: \u201cOur long-term economic goal is to maximize the average annualrate of gain in intrinsic value on a per share basis,\u201d he wrote. And true tohis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to knowabout the economics of these businesses, and more. When Iread the Berkshire Hathaway report I saw businesses, with products andcustomers. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealedthe inner nature of investing.The next morning, I was bursting with a newly discovered passionfor investing, and when the training class was completed, I quickly re-turned to Philadelphia with a single-minded purpose: I was going to in-vest my clients\u2019 money in the same fashion as did Warren Buffett. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then Icollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett Icould find. My goalwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share thoseinsights with my clients. Byfollowing Buffett\u2019s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clientsmore investment success than failure.202 AFTERWORDAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews\u2014an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. As a broker, I was getting the \u201cbuy\u201d part of the equation right,but Buffett\u2019s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the\u201csell\u201d part of the equation more difficult.Eventually I met several portfolio managers who were compensated forperformance regardless of whether they did a lot of buying or selling.It was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett downon paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment ap-proach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, hadbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it cer-tainly couldn\u2019t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became thebasis for The Warren Buffett Way.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions.First, our investment counseling firm needed an instrument to managethose accounts that were not large enough to warrant a separately man-aged portfolio. I wanted toAfterword 203demonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, iffollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns. Armed with theknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,coupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of thoseyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieveabove-average results. First, whenI started the fund, I populated the portfolio mostly with BerkshireHathaway-type stocks: newspapers, beverage companies, other con-sumer nondurable businesses, and selected financial service companies.I even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway.Because my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett\u2019s teachings,perhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfoliowere stocks Buffett himself had purchased. If I continued to invest inthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to gen-erate just average results. Even Buffett was telling Berkshire Hathawayshareholders they could no lon ger expect to earn the above-average in-vestment gains the company had achieved in the past. I knew if I contin-ued to own the same stocks Buffett owned in his portfolio at theseelevated pric es, coupled with moderating economics, I was unlikely togenerate above-average investment results for my shar eholders.There were questions about whether Buffett could compete against thenewer industries and still provide above-average results.I knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was stillvalid. After The Warren Buffett Way was published, we circled backfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navi-gating the economic landscape.In the book, I pointed out that Buffett did not rely solely on lowP/E ratios to s elect stocks. Sometimes a stock with a low P/E ratio did generatecash and achieve high returns on capital and subsequently became a greatinvestment. I told him Buffett\u2019s investment ap-proach was solid. I told him the only way to outwit the stockmarket was to analyze stocks as businesses in order to discover the deep-rooted fundamental changes that occur in a businesses before the mar-ket\u2019s pricing mechanism picks it up. Although Bill\u2019s fund owns companies that are dif-ferent from those in Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, no one candeny that they are approaching the investment process in the same way. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased.One of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was themistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech com-panies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned. And keeping with the Buffettphilosophy, it is not critical that we determine precisely what thevalue of the company is, only that we are buying the company at a sig-nificant price discount (margin of safety) from the range of valuationpossibilities.What some Buffettologists miss in their thinking is that the payoffof being right in the analysis of technology companies more thancompensates for the risk.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett\u2019s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. Several prominent investors havebought stocks not found anywhere in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. A few have taken Buffett\u2019s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The im-portant takeaway is this: Buffett\u2019s investment approach is applicable to alltypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitaliza-tion, regardless of where the business is domiciled. When portfoliomanagers and analysts are willing to study all types of business models,regardless of industry classification, the opportunity to exploit the mar-ket\u2019s periodic mispricing greatly expands, and this translates into betterreturns for our shareholders.Michael Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Legg MasonCapital Management, conducted a study of the b est-performing mutualfunds between 1992 and 2002.1He screened for funds that had onemanager during the period, had assets of at least $1 billion, and beat theStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index over the ten-year period.Portfolio turnover.Afterword 209A common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Super-investors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,or those who lead the funds that Michael\u2019s research identified, is a port-folio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and astock-selection proc ess that emphasizes the discovery of a stock\u2019s intrin-sic value. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his phi-losophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world ofinvesting.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios.Those who follow Buffett\u2019s way will still analyze stocks (and com-panies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;and will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett\u2019s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.4 Berkshire Hathaway 1980 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value7,200,000 GEICO Corporation $ 47,138 $105,3001983,812 General Foods 62,507 59,8892,015,000 Handy & Harman 21,825 58,4351,250,525 SAFECO Corporation 32,063 45,1771,868,600 The Washington Post Company 10,628 42,277464,317 Aluminum Company of America 25,577 27,6851,211,834 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp.11 Berkshire Hathaway 1987 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value3,000,000 Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.12 Berkshire Hathaway 1988 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value3,000,000 Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.90Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1995 Annual Report.20Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1996 Annual Report.50Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1997 Annual Report.

If these \u201cknow-nothing\u201dinvestors want to own common stocks, they should simply put theirmoney in an index fund. W e spent the afternoon analyzing Value Line researchreports and learning to distinguish between stocks that were down inprice and appeared to be cheap and stocks that were up in price and ap-peared to be expensive. I was immediately struck by how seamlesslyBuffett moved back and forth between describing the stocks in the port-folio and the business attributes of Berkshire\u2019s major holdings. It was as ifthe analyses of stocks and of businesses were one and the same.Afterword 201Granted, I had spent the entire day in class analyzing stocks, whichI knew were partial ownership interests in businesses, but I had notmade this most important analytical connection. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with.I even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway. But the difference betweenBuffett\u2019s stocks in the 1980s and those same stocks in 1997 wasstriking. Because these new industries were taking a larger share ofthe market capitalization of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, the stockmarket itself was rising at a faster clip. Other times, a stock with a low P/E ratio consumed cashAfterword 205and generated below-average returns on capital and so became a poorinvestment. What is thecompany\u2019s return on capital. All we must do is analyze each stock as abusiness, determine the value of the business and, to protect againsthigher economic risk, demand a greater margin of safety in the pur-chase price. Others havebought smaller-capitalization stocks. Each one employed a business valuation process to determinewhether stocks were mispriced.1 Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,300 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 33,4011,969,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 33,033592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 17,187220,000 Capital Cities Communications, Inc. 10,909 13,2281,294,308 GEICO Common Stock 4,116 10,516324,580 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. 778 6,039Total $ 71,893 $139,081All other common stocks 34,996 41,992Total common stocks $106,889 $181,073Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Annual Report.2 Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,000 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 43,4451,986,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 28,314953,750 SAFECO Corporation 23,867 26,467592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 19,0391,066,934 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. 18,085 18,671453,800 Knight-Ridder Newspapers 7,534 10,2671,294,308 GEICO Common Stock 4,116 9,060246,450 American Broadcasting Companies 6,082 8,626Total $ 94,260 $163,889All other common stocks 39,506 57,040Total common stocks $133,766 $220,929Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Annual Report.3 Berkshire Hathaway 1979 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value5,730,114 GEICO Corp.

The residue of the three-year bear market of2000 through 2002 left many with a particularly bitter taste in their190 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmouths. Buffett, the exception,has not suffered periods of mediocrity. As investors andspeculators alike have been distracted by esoteric approaches to investing,Buffett has quietly amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune.Given the documented success of Buffett\u2019s performance coupledwith the simplicity of his methodology, the more appropriate questionis, why don\u2019t other investors apply his approach.When Buffett invests, he sees a business.2WARREN BUFFETT , 1990The Unreasonable Man 191a wide variety of businesses in many industries separates Buffett fromall other professional investors.\u201d Buffett asks.\u201d3According to Buffett, the investor and the businessperson shouldlook at the company in the same way, because they both want essentiallythe same thing.If adapting Buffett\u2019s investment strategy required o nly changingperspective, then probably more investors would become pro ponents.4WARREN BUFFETT , 1988192 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett believes it is foolish to use short-term prices to judge a com-pany\u2019s success.INVESTING THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe major goal of this book is to help investors understand and employthe investment strategies that have made Buffett successful. Perhaps in the future you may seeexamples of \u201cBuffett-like\u201d purchases and will be in a position to profitfrom his teachings. investors who know how to think and act like Buffett will berewarded.The Warren Buffett Way is deceptively simple. \u201cWhat we do is notbeyond anybody els e\u2019s competence,\u201d says Buffett.\u201d5The Unreasonable Man 193The irony is that Buffett\u2019s success lies partly in the failure of others. But the gap between Buffett and other pro-fessional investors is widened by their own willingness to play a loser\u2019sgame that Buffett chooses not to play.Whether you are financially able to purchase 10 percent of a com-pany or merely one hundred shares, the Warren Buffett Way can help youachieve profitable investment returns. In the Warren Buffett Way, the first step is the mostchallenging.Buffett does not have a stock quote machine in his office and heseems to get by just fine without it. If you plan on owning shares in an194 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYoutstanding business for a number of years, what happens in the marketon a day-to-day basis is inconsequential.\u201cAfter we buy a stock, we would not be disturbed if markets closedfor a year or two,\u201d says Buffett. Y ou know you have approached Buffett\u2019s level whenyour attention turns to the stock market and the only question on yourmind is: \u201cHas anybody done an ything foolish lately that will give me anopportunity to buy a good business at a great price. Buffettconsiders this thinking to be foolish.Buffett prefers to buy a business that has the opportunity to profitin any economy. Macroeconomic forces may affect returns on the mar-gin, but overall, Buffett\u2019s businesses are able to profit nicely despite va-garies in the economy. But if Buffett were given the same test, hewould begin by methodically measuring the business against his basictenets, one by one:\u2022 Is the business simple and understandable, with a consistent oper-ating history and favorable long-term prospects. Take note:Only at this final step does Buffett look at the stock market price. Buffett deals with this problem in two ways. Because you are no longer196 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmeasuring your success solely by price change or comparing annual pricechange to a common stock benchmark, you have the liberty to s elect thebest businesses available.Buffett believes that wide diversification is required only when in-vestors do not understand what they are doing. Buffettasks you to consider: If the best business you own presents the least fi-nancial risk and has the most favorable long-term prospects, why wouldyou put money into your twentieth favorite business instead of addingmoney to the top choice. In Buffett\u2019s mind, it istoo difficult to make hundreds of smart decisions in a lifetime.The Essence of Warren BuffettThe driving force of Warren Buffett\u2019s investment strategy is the rationalallocation of capital. Buffett\u2019s success is the result of locating that line ofreason and never deviating from its path.Buffett has had his share of failures and no doubt will have a fewmore in the years ahead.The Warren Buffett Way is no different.When Buffett purchases stocks, he focuses on two simple variables:the price of the business and its value. The WarrenBuffett Way is not beyond the comprehension of most serious investors. In fact, the more you enter into a dialogue onprice and value, the more you will begin to understand and appreciatethe Warren Buffett Way.8WARREN BUFFETT , 1993198 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett, over his lifetime, has tried different investment gambits. Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digitinterest rates, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes. \u201cOur (investment)attitude,\u201d said Buffett, \u201cfits our personalities and the way we want to liveour lives.\u201d8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ). As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow\u2019s class.\u201cWarren Buffett,\u201d she cheerily reminded us, \u201cwas Benjamin Graham\u2019smost famous student, you know. And true tohis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to knowabout the economics of these businesses, and more. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealedthe inner nature of investing.The next morning, I was bursting with a newly discovered passionfor investing, and when the training class was completed, I quickly re-turned to Philadelphia with a single-minded purpose: I was going to in-vest my clients\u2019 money in the same fashion as did Warren Buffett. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then Icollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett Icould find. My goalwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share thoseinsights with my clients. Byfollowing Buffett\u2019s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clientsmore investment success than failure.202 AFTERWORDAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews\u2014an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. As a broker, I was getting the \u201cbuy\u201d part of the equation right,but Buffett\u2019s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the\u201csell\u201d part of the equation more difficult.It was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett downon paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment ap-proach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, hadbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it cer-tainly couldn\u2019t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became thebasis for The Warren Buffett Way.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions. I wanted toAfterword 203demonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, iffollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns. Armed with theknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,coupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of thoseyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieveabove-average results.Because my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett\u2019s teachings,perhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfoliowere stocks Buffett himself had purchased.There were questions about whether Buffett could compete against thenewer industries and still provide above-average results.I knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was stillvalid. After The Warren Buffett Way was published, we circled backfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navi-gating the economic landscape. I told him Buffett\u2019s investment ap-proach was solid. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased.One of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was themistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech com-panies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett\u2019s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. A few have taken Buffett\u2019s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The im-portant takeaway is this: Buffett\u2019s investment approach is applicable to alltypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitaliza-tion, regardless of where the business is domiciled.Afterword 209A common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Super-investors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,or those who lead the funds that Michael\u2019s research identified, is a port-folio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and astock-selection proc ess that emphasizes the discovery of a stock\u2019s intrin-sic value. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his phi-losophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world ofinvesting.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios.Those who follow Buffett\u2019s way will still analyze stocks (and com-panies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;and will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett\u2019s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.90Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1995 Annual Report.20Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1996 Annual Report.50Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1997 Annual Report.

Periodically, small capi talization, largecapitalization, growth, value, moment um, thematic, and sector rotationhave proven financially rewarding. The answer may lie inhow people think about investing. The businessperson wants to buy the entire companyand the investor wants to buy portions of the company.If adapting Buffett\u2019s investment strategy required o nly changingperspective, then probably more investors would become pro ponents. The problem remains that most investors use theseshort-term price changes to gauge the success or failure of their invest-ment approach, even though the changes often have little to do withthe changing economic value of the business and much to do with an-ticipating the behavior of other investors.INVESTING THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe major goal of this book is to help investors understand and employthe investment strategies that have made Buffett successful. But this approach will help onlythose investors who are willing to help themselves.Adopting a new and different investment strategy will naturally evokesome uneasiness. But investment success is not synonymous withinfallibility, but it comes about by doing more things right than wrong.Ultimately, the best investment ideas will come from doing yourown homework.Investing is not that complicated.Afterword 201Granted, I had spent the entire day in class analyzing stocks, whichI knew were partial ownership interests in businesses, but I had notmade this most important analytical connection.Over the ensuing years, I built a respectable investment business. Instead, what we got was two very mediocreyears of investment performance.As I analyzed the portfolio and the stock market during this pe-riod, I discovered two important but separate explanations. First, whenI started the fund, I populated the portfolio mostly with BerkshireHathaway-type stocks: newspapers, beverage companies, other con-sumer nondurable businesses, and selected financial service companies. When the econom-ics of your business slow and the discount to intrinsic value narrows, thefuture opportunity for outsized investment returns diminishes. What I soon discovered was thatthe economics of what I owned in the fund were no match for thenewer, more powerful technology-based companies then revving up inthe stock market.204 AFTERWORDIn 1997, my fund was at the crossroads.Standing at the investment crossroads during this period was dra-matic. I knew without question that this business-analytical approachwould still provide the opportunity for investors to spot mispricing andthus profit from the market\u2019s narrower view.At the heart of all Bill\u2019s investment decisions is the requirement ofunderstanding a company\u2019s business model.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett\u2019s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. A few have taken Buffett\u2019s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The im-portant takeaway is this: Buffett\u2019s investment approach is applicable to alltypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitaliza-tion, regardless of where the business is domiciled. Each one employed a business valuation process to determinewhether stocks were mispriced.Michael Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Legg MasonCapital Management, conducted a study of the b est-performing mutualfunds between 1992 and 2002.Investment style.W e have only to observe today\u2019s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett\u2019s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness. Throughoutthe constant evolution of markets and companies, it should be comfortingfor investors to realize there is an investment process that remains robusteven against the inevitable forces of change. Working with far less capital, our investment universe would be farbroader than it is currently.225NotesChapter 1 The World\u2019s Greatest Investor1.
