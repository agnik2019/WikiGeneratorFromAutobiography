Alibaba had been established for less than two years and had lost money over the course of that time. He didn\u2019t know In one year, Alibaba had become a mul -tinationa l company, with employees from t hirteen countries an d little idea of how to manage t hem. With Guan\u2019s assistance, Jack Ma was able to turn the company around. He told employees, \u201cIf you want to work at Alibaba, your daily work has to focus on our three main goals.It is true that inadequacies exist in Alibaba, and there are many questions we will address after the crisis. This letter from Jack Ma not only helped calm things down in the company but also paci\ufb01ed the emotions of relatives and helped win public support. Alibaba came through the expe-rience unscathed and with a sense of cohesiveness and esprit de corps that had been missing previously. Despite the SARS inter-ruption, Alibaba increased its revenue by over \ufb01ve times in 2003, and accomplished what to some was seen as a miracle of bringing average daily income to more than RMB 1 million.The Internet had reached the bottom of its trough at the end of the year 2000, and as head of Alibaba, Jack Ma brought 92his team home to C hina.From 2001 to 2003, the period in which Alibaba faced its most urgent crises, Ma promoted these Maoist management cam-paigns because he felt that they were effective ways to reform the company in this particular period.Alibaba had been functioning as a kind of guerrilla operation, Ma told his company, and now it was time to create a \u201cproper army that could \ufb01ght tough battles. If I care d, Alibaba wou ld not have survive d to to day.\u201d In t he end, Ma an d senior man -agement wrote up a constitution for the company t hat was in -tended to \u201cenable Alibaba to continue to grow for 102 years,\u201d and incor porated the highest principles of the com pany. Most im portant ly, the business model of Alibaba was becoming c learer. T o draw in China Suppliers who were willing to cough up membership fees, Alibaba had to create a tremendous platform, stock it with large quantities of information, and thereby attract the eyes of buyers and sellers. By providing a real service to Chinese companies and thus serving a real need, Alibaba began to stand out ahead of the rest of the Internet pack. Costs are care-fully controlled at Alibaba. In 2004, however, Jack Ma was not in favor o f adding to his investor commitments. These \ufb01ve included Sohu\u2019s CEO, Zhang Chaoy-ang; Sina\u2019s president, Wang Zhidong; NetEase\u2019s chairman of the board, Ding Lei; the chairman of the board of 8848 (the company named for the height of Mt. Everest in meters), Wang Juntao; and Alibaba\u2019s CEO, Jack Ma. I plan to teach everyone about Alibaba\u2019s thousand and one mistakes. Atten ding were Ten gxun\u2019s CEO, Ma Huateng; the president of 3721, Zhou Hongwei (the name comes from 3 \u00d7 7 = 21, which in Chinese means something akin to \u201cjust do it\u201d); t he CEO o f Y ouc heng, Lian g Jianzhang; and the president of Lianzhong, Bao Qiuqiao.In April 2003, Jack Ma registered the name of the confer-ences as a company-owned trademark.com In-ternet Group president Wang Leilei, T engxun CEO Ma Huateng, Shanda Internet CEO Chen Tian qiao, Y ouchen g CEO Lian g Ji-anzhang, Baidu president Li Yan hong, and Alibaba CEO Jack Ma., of which Masayoshi Son is chairman and CEO. This was quite different from Alibaba\u2019s for-merly steadfast emphasis on being a service company for enter-prises. The standard line had been that Alibaba intended to increase the wealth of its enterprise partners, whereby it would increase its own pro\ufb01t. Alibaba threw out an additional bombshell in summer 2003 when it declared it was investing $12 million (RMB 100 million) in the project, which later rose to $55 million (RMB 450 million).\u2019s co-founder Yan g Zhiyuan (Jerry Yang); Alibaba\u2019s CEO, Jack Ma; Din g Lei, chairman of the board of NetEase; the president and CEO o f Tengxun, Ma Huaten g; Sohu\u2019s chairman of the board and CEO, Zhang Chaoyang; and Sina\u2019s CEO an d president, Wan g Yan. and Alibabamight com bine forces. Less than one year later, Alibaba would announce its marriage to Yahoo. Ma regards himself as someone who is i gnorant o f technology, while Alibaba is positione d as a technology-based Internet company. As Tang Seng nee ded Mon -key for his skills on the journey westward, so Alibaba needs a core group of people who are attune d to com puters an d mathematics. The \ufb01rst rule Ma has tried to inculcate at Alibaba is to be happy in what one is doing. Alibaba\u2019s salaries have always been low compared to those in the general market-place. Another is that Alibaba is not interested in attracting people on t he basis of high promises; it wants to attract t hem on the basis of its corporate culture. Alibaba \u201cnever voluntarily takes actions that poach people from other companies,\u201d but at the same time, man ypeople have been attracte d to A libaba precise ly be-cause of its spirit.\u201d Another stated, \u201cAlibaba is a company that doesn\u2019t wear clothes.\u201dCCTV holds a contest called Best Employer of the Y ear ev-ery year, and Alibaba was selected one of China\u2019s T en Best in 2005.\u201dA number of the senior management team at Alibaba have been with Ma for the whole length of Alibaba\u2019s history. Li Qi is the current COO, Sun Danyu is general manager of Taobao, and Jin Jianhang is deputy vice president of Alibaba.110Originally from Taiwan, Cai has a law degree from Ya le and, before he joined Alibaba, was serving as Asian representative of the venture capital \ufb01rm Invest AB.

C hina an d Alibaba formed a strategic partnership that involved a transfer of $1 billion to A libaba as we ll as hundreds of employees. Understanding me is pretty easy, but it does not mean that you understand Alibaba. Alibaba is a team, not just me, and it has a strong culture. When peoplelook at Alibaba, therefore, they think it\u2019s all Jack Ma. Alibaba\u2019s future is insepa-rable from Hangzhou.Back in Beijing, Ma also spoke at the Great Hall of the People on September 23, addressing twenty-\ufb01ve hundred Alibaba employees, now joined by another seven hundred \u201crelatives\u201d from Yahoo. T his process of supplying credit ratings and veri\ufb01cation and authenti -cation services a llowed Alibaba to sur ge forwar d in its B2B busi-ness.

This letter from Jack Ma not only helped calm things down in the company but also paci\ufb01ed the emotions of relatives and helped win public support. Alibaba came through the expe-rience unscathed and with a sense of cohesiveness and esprit de corps that had been missing previously. Despite the SARS inter-ruption, Alibaba increased its revenue by over \ufb01ve times in 2003, and accomplished what to some was seen as a miracle of bringing average daily income to more than RMB 1 million.The Internet had reached the bottom of its trough at the end of the year 2000, and as head of Alibaba, Jack Ma brought 92his team home to C hina.From 2001 to 2003, the period in which Alibaba faced its most urgent crises, Ma promoted these Maoist management cam-paigns because he felt that they were effective ways to reform the company in this particular period.

On November 6, 17 percent of Alibaba.com was sold to public shareholders, with 75 percent retained by the parent company, the Alibaba Group, and 8 percent by employees, management, and consultants.

T he new CEO of Alibaba.com, in charge of all Alibaba\u2019s B2B business, is David Wei. Wei comes from outsi de the Alibaba fold: he previous ly headed China\u2019s largest home improvement retai ler, so he understan ds the buying and selling side of the business from the customer per -spective. A new CFO, Ma ggie Wu, was a lso hired from outsi de to handle Alibaba.The Alibaba.com IPO re presente d the secon d largest Inter -net IPO in history, despite being a pu blic offering for less than one-\ufb01fth of only one part of the Alibaba Group. A fter listing, Alibaba. As of mid-2008, Alibaba.These high marks can be attri buted to the way in w hich Alibaba was reorganized prior to the listing. At the same time, the sister entities continue to contribute to the overall critical mass of Alibaba\u2019s business.Three major investment banks shepherded the process of taking Alibaba into a new era: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. Alibaba.com was incorporated in Sep-tember 2006 as a holding company for the B2B businesses of the Alibaba Group. Taobao, Alibaba, and Alipay were split off as sepa-rate entities, though still under the overarching structure of the Alibaba Group. The Alibaba Group has made no public decision regarding whether to inject other group assets into the Alibaba.com listed company. Separating the businesses may help the Alibaba Group pursue its strategic goal of dominating e-commerce-related activities, including marketplaces, payments, search, and advertising\u2014in China and elsewhere\u2014by allowing its unlisted units to focus on market growth rather than pro\ufb01tability.Alibaba. Alibaba. Bai du and Alibaba.com both act as listing tools for small and medium-sized enterprises, but Baidu offers these com panies ex posure on ly in China, w hereas A libaba. Bai du serves both wholesalers and retailers, whereas Alibaba.In industry jargon, Alibaba operates online networks that de -rive va lue from t heir mem bers\u2019 interactions. The networ k that Alibaba offers re lates primari ly to com -merce, an d selling that idea to customers requires tremen dous sales force participation. In point of fact, Alibaba\u2019s is a labor-intensive mo del. Reorganization and IPO 195The Business ModelAlibaba makes money by charging customers for membership services. Alibaba. As of June 2007, Alibaba. Buyers are allowed onsite for free, but Alibaba charges fees for services to sellers. Because of the free access, Alibaba states that \u201ctogether our marketplaces form a community of more than 24 million registered users from over 200 countries and regions.\u201dSome three-quarters of Alibaba. Alibaba started charging for its English-language marketplace ser-vices in the year 2000. Alibaba started charging for domestic services in 2002; now nearly 222,000 suppliers are currently registered and pay this price. T his is highly bene\ufb01cial to Alibaba\u2019s cash \ufb02ow; revenues are amortized over the period for which they are contracted.Alibaba\u2019s business mo del takes advantage of the fact that China has been an d continues to be the primary pro duct sup -plier to the world. A libaba therefore focuses on the top o f this enormous pyrami d of small companies\u2014in ot her words, those savvy and nimble enough to get their products to global markets. These companies may also list on Alibaba, but for free. A libaba provides a venue not just for paying suppliers but for any supp lier who wants to post very basic in formation, gratis, on the site. T hese num bers are the base upon which Alibaba builds its business. Alibaba has already developed a critica l mass o f buyers an d suppliers on its marketplace, w hich is the largest in t he wor ld.Financials of the listed company are therefore excellent.One might wonder why suppliers would pay to be listed on Alibaba if they could post their products for free. The rea-son relates to Alibaba\u2019s services. One of the new services, which points to trends to come, is the ability to take out loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on the basis of one\u2019s trade volume on Alibaba. Overall, Alibaba\u2019s strategy is to convert nonpaying sup-pliers to paying ones by offering irresistible value-added bene\ufb01ts. Alibaba has therefore served a use-ful function for all who need the stability of an ongoing market. At the same time, Alibaba is increasingly used by larger buyers as well, who do initial screening of offerings on the Internet. T ypical buyers on Alibaba.Alipay is a critical part of the Alibaba scheme. The company is not part of the listed Alibaba.com, but Alibaba. As noted above, Alibaba. Alibaba has resisted a model that charges for every transaction, but by channeling payments through Ali-198pay, Alibaba success fully earns a percenta ge of transactions as we ll. Whether or not Alibaba will start charging direct transaction fees remains to be seen. The relationship between Alibaba and Alipay makes it c lear that as t he digital conver gence procee ds, the wor ld will also witness a convergence o f the \ufb01nancia l and IT sectors.

An um-brella parent called the Alibaba Group became the repository for several of the af\ufb01liated Alibaba companies, including 75 percent of the B2B online marketplace called Alibaba. On November 6, 17 percent of Alibaba.com was sold to public shareholders, with 75 percent retained by the parent company, the Alibaba Group, and 8 percent by employees, management, and consultants. Alibaba. Han gzhou Alibaba Advertising Co., is incorporate d in the Peop le\u2019s Repu blic of China and holds the Internet content provider (ICP) license that allows A libaba to do its Internet business in C hina. Wit h 80 percent o f shares, Jac k Ma is in contro l of Hangz hou Alibaba, and Simon Xie, one of the early founders of Alibaba, holds the other 20 percent. Wit hout licenses from t his China-based entit y, Ali-baba, as an o ffshore-based entity, cou ld not operate as an Internet company within China . T he new CEO of Alibaba.com, in charge of all Alibaba\u2019s B2B business, is David Wei. Wei comes from outsi de the Alibaba fold: he previous ly headed China\u2019s largest home improvement retai ler, so he understan ds the buying and selling side of the business from the customer per -spective. A new CFO, Ma ggie Wu, was a lso hired from outsi de to handle Alibaba.The Alibaba.com IPO re presente d the secon d largest Inter -net IPO in history, despite being a pu blic offering for less than one-\ufb01fth of only one part of the Alibaba Group. A fter listing, Alibaba. As of mid-2008, Alibaba.These high marks can be attri buted to the way in w hich Alibaba was reorganized prior to the listing. At the same time, the sister entities continue to contribute to the overall critical mass of Alibaba\u2019s business.Three major investment banks shepherded the process of taking Alibaba into a new era: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. Alibaba.com was incorporated in Sep-tember 2006 as a holding company for the B2B businesses of the Alibaba Group. Taobao, Alibaba, and Alipay were split off as sepa-rate entities, though still under the overarching structure of the Alibaba Group.com listed company. Separating the businesses may help the Alibaba Group pursue its strategic goal of dominating e-commerce-related activities, including marketplaces, payments, search, and advertising\u2014in China and elsewhere\u2014by allowing its unlisted units to focus on market growth rather than pro\ufb01tability.Alibaba. Alibaba. Its primary competitors in the search market in China are Baidu and Google. Bai du and Alibaba.com both act as listing tools for small and medium-sized enterprises, but Baidu offers these com panies ex posure on ly in China, w hereas A libaba. Bai du serves both wholesalers and retailers, whereas Alibaba.com now holds 60 per-cent o f its mar ket share in China.In industry jargon, Alibaba operates online networks that de -rive va lue from t heir mem bers\u2019 interactions. The networ k that Alibaba offers re lates primari ly to com -merce, an d selling that idea to customers requires tremen dous sales force participation. In point of fact, Alibaba\u2019s is a labor-intensive mo del. Sales of\ufb01ces were opene d insixteen cities in China prior to 2007 and in another fourteen cit -ies in 2007. Alibaba.com operates international (English-language) and domestic (Chinese-language) online marketplaces, which charge companies, primarily small companies, to list products on-line. As of June 2007, Alibaba. Buyers are allowed onsite for free, but Alibaba charges fees for services to sellers. Because of the free access, Alibaba states that \u201ctogether our marketplaces form a community of more than 24 million registered users from over 200 countries and regions.\u201dSome three-quarters of Alibaba. Around twenty-two thousand China Suppliers are currently registered as members and pay this price. Alibaba started charging for its English-language marketplace ser-vices in the year 2000. Alibaba started charging for domestic services in 2002; now nearly 222,000 suppliers are currently registered and pay this price. T his is highly bene\ufb01cial to Alibaba\u2019s cash \ufb02ow; revenues are amortized over the period for which they are contracted.Alibaba\u2019s business mo del takes advantage of the fact that China has been an d continues to be the primary pro duct sup -plier to the world. As mentioned previously, some four-\ufb01fths of the com panies su pplying products to t he wor ld from C hina are small- and medium-size d enterprises, an d there are a bout 32 mi l-lion such enterprises in China. These companies may also list on Alibaba, but for free. A libaba provides a venue not just for paying suppliers but for any supp lier who wants to post very basic in formation, gratis, on the site. T hese num bers are the base upon which Alibaba builds its business. Alibaba has already developed a critica l mass o f buyers an d suppliers on its marketplace, w hich is the largest in t he wor ld.Financials of the listed company are therefore excellent.One might wonder why suppliers would pay to be listed on Alibaba if they could post their products for free. One of the new services, which points to trends to come, is the ability to take out loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on the basis of one\u2019s trade volume on Alibaba. Alibaba has therefore served a use-ful function for all who need the stability of an ongoing market. At the same time, Alibaba is increasingly used by larger buyers as well, who do initial screening of offerings on the Internet. T ypical buyers on Alibaba.Alipay is a critical part of the Alibaba scheme. The company is not part of the listed Alibaba.com, but Alibaba. As noted above, Alibaba. The relationship between Alibaba and Alipay makes it c lear that as t he digital conver gence procee ds, the wor ld will also witness a convergence o f the \ufb01nancia l and IT sectors.

An um-brella parent called the Alibaba Group became the repository for several of the af\ufb01liated Alibaba companies, including 75 percent of the B2B online marketplace called Alibaba. On November 6, 17 percent of Alibaba.com was sold to public shareholders, with 75 percent retained by the parent company, the Alibaba Group, and 8 percent by employees, management, and consultants. Alibaba. Han gzhou Alibaba Advertising Co., is incorporate d in the Peop le\u2019s Repu blic of China and holds the Internet content provider (ICP) license that allows A libaba to do its Internet business in C hina. Wit h 80 percent o f shares, Jac k Ma is in contro l of Hangz hou Alibaba, and Simon Xie, one of the early founders of Alibaba, holds the other 20 percent. T he new CEO of Alibaba.com, in charge of all Alibaba\u2019s B2B business, is David Wei. Wei comes from outsi de the Alibaba fold: he previous ly headed China\u2019s largest home improvement retai ler, so he understan ds the buying and selling side of the business from the customer per -spective. A new CFO, Ma ggie Wu, was a lso hired from outsi de to handle Alibaba.The Alibaba.com IPO re presente d the secon d largest Inter -net IPO in history, despite being a pu blic offering for less than one-\ufb01fth of only one part of the Alibaba Group. A fter listing, Alibaba. As of mid-2008, Alibaba. At the same time, the sister entities continue to contribute to the overall critical mass of Alibaba\u2019s business.Three major investment banks shepherded the process of taking Alibaba into a new era: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. Alibaba.com was incorporated in Sep-tember 2006 as a holding company for the B2B businesses of the Alibaba Group. Taobao, Alibaba, and Alipay were split off as sepa-rate entities, though still under the overarching structure of the Alibaba Group. The Alibaba Group has made no public decision regarding whether to inject other group assets into the Alibaba.com listed company. Separating the businesses may help the Alibaba Group pursue its strategic goal of dominating e-commerce-related activities, including marketplaces, payments, search, and advertising\u2014in China and elsewhere\u2014by allowing its unlisted units to focus on market growth rather than pro\ufb01tability.Alibaba. Alibaba. Bai du and Alibaba.com both act as listing tools for small and medium-sized enterprises, but Baidu offers these com panies ex posure on ly in China, w hereas A libaba. Bai du serves both wholesalers and retailers, whereas Alibaba.In industry jargon, Alibaba operates online networks that de -rive va lue from t heir mem bers\u2019 interactions. The networ k that Alibaba offers re lates primari ly to com -merce, an d selling that idea to customers requires tremen dous sales force participation. In point of fact, Alibaba\u2019s is a labor-intensive mo del. Reorganization and IPO 195The Business ModelAlibaba makes money by charging customers for membership services. Alibaba. As of June 2007, Alibaba. Because of the free access, Alibaba states that \u201ctogether our marketplaces form a community of more than 24 million registered users from over 200 countries and regions.\u201dSome three-quarters of Alibaba. Alibaba started charging for its English-language marketplace ser-vices in the year 2000. Alibaba started charging for domestic services in 2002; now nearly 222,000 suppliers are currently registered and pay this price. T his is highly bene\ufb01cial to Alibaba\u2019s cash \ufb02ow; revenues are amortized over the period for which they are contracted.Alibaba\u2019s business mo del takes advantage of the fact that China has been an d continues to be the primary pro duct sup -plier to the world. As mentioned previously, some four-\ufb01fths of the com panies su pplying products to t he wor ld from C hina are small- and medium-size d enterprises, an d there are a bout 32 mi l-lion such enterprises in China. A libaba therefore focuses on the top o f this enormous pyrami d of small companies\u2014in ot her words, those savvy and nimble enough to get their products to global markets. These companies may also list on Alibaba, but for free. A libaba provides a venue not just for paying suppliers but for any supp lier who wants to post very basic in formation, gratis, on the site. T hese num bers are the base upon which Alibaba builds its business. Alibaba has already developed a critica l mass o f buyers an d suppliers on its marketplace, w hich is the largest in t he wor ld.Financials of the listed company are therefore excellent.One might wonder why suppliers would pay to be listed on Alibaba if they could post their products for free. The rea-son relates to Alibaba\u2019s services. One of the new services, which points to trends to come, is the ability to take out loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on the basis of one\u2019s trade volume on Alibaba. Alibaba has therefore served a use-ful function for all who need the stability of an ongoing market. At the same time, Alibaba is increasingly used by larger buyers as well, who do initial screening of offerings on the Internet.
