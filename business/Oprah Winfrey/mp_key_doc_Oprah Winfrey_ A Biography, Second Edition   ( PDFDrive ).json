{"Oprah_Winfrey_2008": " Undoubtedly, someday not far into the future, there will be girls named Oprah. A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star. In another poll, some admirers picked former Senator 2 OPRAH WINFREYHillary Clinton as their favorite woman, but a Fox News Opinion poll showed Oprah to be more powerful than Clinton.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign. This was a \ufb01  rst for Oprah, who had attempted to be impartial in previous campaigns. When interviewed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Oprah\u2019s closest friend, Gayle King, stated that she and Oprah think of politics differently. Oprah generally has little interest in politics, but Gayle is completely immersed in everything political and describes herself as someone who \u201ceat[s], sleep[s] and breathe[s] politics.\u201d For Oprah, Obama made the difference. By endorsing her longtime friend, Oprah thought her personal participation was more valuable than money; Obama\u2019s popularity went up, but her involvement affected her own ratings adversely.  From the time she \ufb01  rst announced her political partisanship, there was a steady drop in the numbers of people who would be likely to vote for an Oprah choice. Some reporters claimed that white women were angry at Obama but not at Oprah; it also has been attributed to women who had great hopes to see a woman (Hillary Clinton) elected. One headline captured this sentiment with \u201cOprah\u2019s talk show crown slipping.\u201d Another, an eye-catching headline on May 29, 2008, in the tabloid  Star Magazine  questioned: \u201cHas Oprah passed her expiration date.\u201d Comedian Roseanne Barr went further in her blog than most liberals in her attack on Oprah (as well as aiming a verbal barrage at a number of other well-known Democrats, whom she accused of wanting to lose the election by nominating Barack Obama). Her most hostile, and somewhat hysterical, language, however, was directed at Oprah. Barr stated, Oprah \u201calways gets her republican friends elected.\u201d Ad-ditionally, Barr wrote that Oprah succeeded in splitting the women\u2019s vote and destabilizing the entire Democratic Party. 3  Yet only a few years earlier, Roseanne had lavished praise on Oprah.  The friendliest advice Oprah might have followed was given by a  Los Angeles Times  writer after Obama failed to gain more votes than Hillary Clinton in Indiana: \u201cHer [Oprah\u2019s] estimated fortune of Democratic presidential hopeful, Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., his wife Michelle, right, and Oprah Winfrey wave to the crowd at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Although Rich agrees that Oprah is a \u201cmegaceleb-rity,\u201d he pointed out that \u201cselling presidents is not the same as pushing  Anna Karenina.\u201d Rich quoted a laudatory description of Oprah from Billy Graham\u2019s evangelical journal,  Christianity T oday:  She is \u201can icon of church-free spirituality,\u201d and her beliefs \u201ccannot simply be dismissed as super\ufb01  cial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble.\u201d In contrast, a group of evangelical Christians, labeling Oprah \u201cthe queen of the new age gurus,\u201d places her among those \u201cwho are sucking millions of people into false doctrines.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs. Where Pilkington frowns upon Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence as a false guru, Farr labels her \u201cthe perfect guru for [our] democratic age,\u201d one who insists we each have our own power and control in making choices.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Yet, regardless of the polls about Oprah\u2019s television rat-ings, it seems her support of Obama provided an important in\ufb02  uence on more than a million voters. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. They found that more than a million people cast votes for Obama in the prima-ries as a result of Oprah\u2019s endorsement, which Johnson labeled \u201cOprah Winfrey\u2019s million-voter march\u201d (a play on the name of an event of sev-eral years earlier. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime.\u201d  Multiple reports that previously were doubtful or negative about Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence in the campaign soon reversed, \ufb01  nding that she had given a huge boost to Obama; famed longtime reporter, David Broder, writing during the campaign in Iowa, told of the enormous crowds never before seen in the history of Iowa caucuses. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. A nontelevised affair took place when Oprah hosted a party at the White House the night of the inauguration. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. Many newspapers, including some in Europe, made much of a publi-cist\u2019s spokesperson\u2019s announcement that Oprah would be in Denver\u2019s Invesco Field football stadium for the nomination of Barack Obama; they also quoted Gayle King\u2019s statements that Oprah would not address the crowds. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah.   The  Chicago Sun-Times  has an Oprah-dedicated blogger, Mark Bieganski, who calls his blog \u201cIt\u2019s all about Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. As  New York Times  writer Alexandra Stanley has said of Oprah, she has \u201cnever concealed her messianic sense of purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  An \u201caha\u201d moment, the kind she writes about monthly in  O, The Oprah Magazine,  came to Oprah not only through such experiences as her trip to Israel. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Of all the areas that Oprah has been involved in, selling real estate isn\u2019t one. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. Oprah served in that capacity following the national disaster of September 11, 2001. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press. One that has covered a larger territory and has been reviewed more widely is Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah: Cultural Icon for the Neoliberal Press.\u201d In a lengthy \u201cBlack Agenda Radio Interview\u201d hosted by Brace Dixon, Peck agrees that she regards Oprah\u2019s message as politi-cal, a politics \u201cthat puts the personal responsibility for being poor and oppressed exclusively on the poor and oppressed. society has not transcended race, that we cover up and avoid many issues, which is what Oprah has done, with the result that her \u201cmajority white following\u201d remains com-fortable with her.  Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. However, rumors persisted that Oprah would not renew her contract with CBS after 2011, once she bought into the new network, OWN. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr. Kathleen Rooney, \u201cThe Five Myths about Oprah, Obama,\u201d  Wash-ington Post,  14 Sept.\u201d In the deeply 26 OPRAH WINFREYRepublican state, election history reveals that no Democratic candi-date for president since Jimmy Carter had won Mississippi.  Mississippi is also the birthplace of Oprah Winfrey, perhaps the most famous black entertainer ever, known throughout the world for her work in television as well as her philanthropic, educational, and social efforts. He ed-its an article each month on Oprah\u2019s Web site and frequently contrib-utes to her magazine. Smith\u2019s latest restaurant is on Capitol Hill, in the Liaison Hotel, where a postinaugural 2008 live television Oprah show was \ufb01  lmed as part of the election week festivities. (Rumors beforehand,  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 27resembling those in Colorado, placed Oprah\u2019s whereabouts in multiple parts of the city; the most intriguing detail generally is the cost of ho-tels and amenities for Oprah\u2014in this case, $15,000 per night. Oprah, on Smith\u2019s 50th birthday, donated $250,000 to his non-pro\ufb01  t charity Common Threads. Oprah often speaks of the books that af-fected her most in growing up, and, in an issue of her now-defunct  O At Home  magazine, she reminisced about them. When, in adulthood, Oprah and some of her friends have spoken of these mat-ters, their words re\ufb02  ect the books, poems, and stories that are part of the United States\u2019 literary and cultural heritage. Oprah and various friends have lived these stories. Oprah\u2014as well as Elvis\u2014is a prime example of that effect. Oprah recently learned she is a distant cousin of a famous gospel music singer, Mavis Staples. Yet, cultural history 30 OPRAH WINFREYnotes they had to head north or west, where they gained fame and sometimes\u2014but not always\u2014fortune. However, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most famous celebrities in the world, was born in a little-known area of Mississippi. Psychologists and psychiatrists have stated that the \ufb01  rst \ufb01 ve years determine much of who and what we are, and if we accept that thesis, we must apply it to Oprah, even though in most ways she does not appear to \ufb01  t the Southern image. During the time of Oprah\u2019s slave ancestors, and during her grandparents\u2019 lives, her mother\u2019s life, and her own early years, Mississippi was (and remains) close to the bot-tom of the economic ladder despite its association with some of the great names in U. And Angelou, 32 OPRAH WINFREYwho is always identi\ufb01  ed as a Southerner, lived in many parts of the country and elsewhere but \ufb01  nally settled in North Carolina. In con-trast, Oprah, who spent more years in the South than either Capote or Angelou, turned her back on it, saying at various times throughout the years that she knew when she moved to Chicago at 30 that she had found her home.  Although Oprah always credits two members of her family\u2014her ma-ternal grandmother, Hattie Mae Lee, and her father, Vernon Winfrey\u2014with the qualities that have led to her success, her memories of child-hood and early years are \ufb01  lled with more pain and sadness than joy. Those hardships, re\ufb02  ected in many of her interests and activities, are recognizable to all Oprah watchers, some of whom share similar experiences.  A series of accidents are part of Oprah\u2019s heritage; she was born ille-gitimate, the child of two very young people. In an interview in a tabloid newspaper, Vernon Winfrey \u201cconfessed\u201d he could not have fathered Oprah because he was on army duty at the time. Vernita re-cently modi\ufb01  ed her story once again, insisting that Vernon is the only person who could be Oprah\u2019s father. Winfrey was a soldier stationed at Camp Rucker in Alabama.  Like the pregnancy, the name that has become a household word, Oprah, was also an accident.  The name Orpah isn\u2019t used anywhere else, and the spelling of Oprah\u2019s name became the one we know today. Much is made of the fact that Oprah spent her early years with her grandmother, yet she is only one of a number of famous people who had the same experience, among them former President Bill Clinton, Tipper Gore, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Different sto-ries are told about the reasons for Oprah\u2019s move. In remembering details from her childhood, Oprah has half humorously and half seriously referred to the use of the Sears catalogue in the outhouse. An incident did occur one night when Oprah was about four years old. Al-though the neighbor was old and blind, Oprah remembers him as a res-cuer. 34 OPRAH WINFREY Much like life on the farm, her grandmother was rigid and harsh, meting out punishment for any infringement of rules, even for happen-ings over which the girl had little or no control.\u201d  In recalling her early years, Oprah has re\ufb02  ected that, at various times, she spoke at all the churches in Nashville.  On the Lee farm, Oprah was lonely, isolated, and friendless. Oprah envied children who had easier lives, particularly white children, whose families owned television sets and washing machines; children who had store-bought clothing and who could go to movies; and children who were not punished for every little misdeed, knowing or unknowing. Yet, despite the fact that some writers have called Oprah\u2019s life one of extreme or grinding poverty, because her grandmother owned a farm, she was able to feed and clothe her family, and they never went hungry. (One of Oprah\u2019s relatives claims that Oprah had exaggerated the matter. As a result, Oprah\u2019s sole companions were the pigs she helped take care of. Away from the little house, she could read, talk, and tell stories to them; her restrictive grandmother and her friends believed that Oprah talked too much. Only in adulthood did she recognize 36 OPRAH WINFREYhow fortunate she had been to live with her grandmother for the \ufb01  rst six years of her life; only then could she sort out the love that existed beneath her fear.  Oprah has said she expects to be spiritual in the ways her grand-mother was, to be someone who \ufb01  ts into the amen corner. Oprah\u2019s mother, Vernita, seems to have lacked the qualities of her own mother that Oprah admires and cherishes.\u201d In the same interview, Vernita Lee\u2019s memories of herself when Oprah lived with her bear no resemblance to those of Oprah, nor of the writers who have interviewed the family.\u201d Today, she saves copies of  O  magazine because she thinks they might someday be important, but she also has been annoyed by people who would refer to her as Oprah\u2019s mother. 2   From an early age, like many African Americans, Oprah has been conscious of color\u2014not only in terms of race but of what differences in color mean in people\u2019s lives. Oprah\u2019s longings were neither unique nor limited to blacks. 3  The same is true of Oprah, who believes today that all things are possible. Never one to accept the idea of black power\u2014particularly the uncompromising form practiced in the 1970s, when militancy was common\u2014she felt out of 38 OPRAH WINFREYplace in an atmosphere that was frequently hostile. As a dark-skinned African Amer-ican who had some experience of prejudice once she left Mississippi, Oprah has been outspoken on many occasions in her views of racial snobbery that exists even among blacks.  When she got into college, Oprah felt cynical, if not bitter, about the kinds of color discrimination practiced not only on the outside but also within the black community. However, during Oprah\u2019s girlhood in Milwaukee and Nashville, she learned of color issues she\u2019d not confronted before.  Oprah\u2019s undeniable interest in black history in the last two decades has taken many forms in books, movies, and artifacts. Oprah\u2019s read-ing and acting interests meshed when Quincy Jones asked her in 1985 to take the role of So\ufb01  a in a movie about African Americans, Alice Walker\u2019s  The Color Purple,  which became a controversial but \ufb01  nancial and popular success. That would change within a few years with  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 39Oprah\u2019s fame and wealth and the opportunities they brought.\u201d In effect, says Carliss, that woman is Oprah. The 40 OPRAH WINFREY\ufb01 nancial return of approximately $22. The loss was more than monetary to a disheartened Oprah, who had a tremendous emotional commitment to the work and its author.\u201d Despite the \ufb02  op, the acting bug never left Oprah, and she has continued to perform in and \ufb01 nance movies for television and theater, and she has experienced both success and failure. His hostile column depicted Oprah as  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 41the \u201cI used cocaine but the man made me do it\u201d host on her program fea-turing a group of women stars from the movie, and in bristling language speaks of her and her guests as \u201ccackl[ing] about how black men do black women wrong in relationships.\u201d 7   Nothing was controversial in  Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,  a movie about Oprah\u2019s dear friend, another \ufb01  lm she produced in 1997. Like his friend Oprah, Jones is someone who uses his celebrity to help children. Before Oprah began a search for her roots with Henry Louis Gates, friend to both Oprah and Jones, Jones led the way. (Similar criticism has been leveled about the choices for her 42 OPRAH WINFREYhighly successful book club. Apparently, West felt a kinship to Oprah, because she had her number on speed dial and didn\u2019t hesitate to use it, as she did one day to complain to Oprah that someone had parked illegally in front of her house. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know what Oprah\u2019s response was. Like many of Oprah\u2019s choices of more recent novels, it focuses on a woman who rebels against societal rules to live the life she chooses. Once again, Oprah selected Halle Berry to play the lead.  Oprah\u2019s most popular television movie, also under the label Oprah Winfrey Presents, was made in 1999 from Mitch Albom\u2019s phenomenally  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 43successful book  Tuesdays with Morrie.  Oprah\u2019s absorption in the historic life of slaves has led her, like a number of other famous and well-to-do African Americans, such as writer and professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Clearly, Oprah has not been the \ufb01  rst person to discuss the favored treatment of light- and lighter-skinned Americans.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s interest in the life of slaves and her search for her own roots in the writings from the troubled era of earlier centuries have become part of her persona. Secretary of state in the Bush administration, Con-doleezza Rice, wrote a brief essay about Oprah for  Time  magazine in 2007 44 OPRAH WINFREYin which she identi\ufb01  es Oprah\u2019s life as the story of America: the South-ern girl who lived in poverty, whose childhood years were spent in a home that had neither electricity nor running water; a girl who later used her education, her work, and her fortune to better the lives of many people in her own country and abroad.  Oprah, in matters of family, color, and other issues, came to under-stand and forgive much that embittered her in earlier years. Time helped to distance her from bitterness toward Vernita, whom she saw as an angry, hostile parent, a woman with no love to spare for Oprah.  Oprah\u2019s success as an entertainer and her generosity years later im-proved Vernita\u2019s life. Oprah\u2019s father, by far the better parent, asked for almost nothing. It took several years for Oprah to forgive her. They were never close, and Oprah has said that she feels little affection or obligation to any other family member except her father, Vernon Winfrey. After failed attempts to get Jeffrey, her brother, to change his life and take responsibility for his actions, Oprah refused to help him \ufb01  nancially\u2014although without his knowing it, she provided extra money for him through Vernita.  Some of Oprah\u2019s anger toward family members after she\u2019d achieved fame and fortune resulted from the expectations of relatives and their friends that she would help them monetarily, combined with the fact that they, like her sister and brother, did nothing to help themselves. One relative, how-ever, praises her aunt Oprah for setting an example.  The woman, a niece of Oprah\u2019s who lives in Milwaukee, was inter-viewed by a reporter about the business she and her husband run and the volunteer work they do for the program Discovering Our Destiny. In talking about herself and her famous aunt, Alisha Hayes tells a story of earlier years when she\u2019d asked Oprah for a new car; after her aunt refused, the young woman accepted the idea that she would have to provide it for herself. Oprah has been generous to her nieces in many ways.  Some biographers have claimed that Oprah holds back nothing about her life, but writer Barbara Grizzutti Harrison notes that Oprah does skirt issues having to do with her family. Even though the press re-ports whatever news there is about her parents, Oprah is reticent about their doings. Vernita\u2019s hopes for marriages brought disappointments in her personal life that were and are not uncommon, something Oprah learned to understand but which were beyond her comprehension when she was a child. 46 OPRAH WINFREY Experience in the larger world brought the mature Oprah into con-tact with many poor young black women whose lives resemble Vernita\u2019s. If Oprah had remained with her mother, the direction of her own life might well have been similar to Vernita\u2019s. Oprah\u2019s huge success and wealth opened doors for Vernita that she never could have achieved on her own. Because of Oprah\u2019s fame and fortune, Vernita\u2019s life resembles that of many a rich person. An account in the entertainment section of the Milwaukee  Journal Sentinel  in September 2008 led a story with the heading, \u201cOprah\u2019s mom is accused of being a deadbeat.\u201d After many months of that type of publicity, Oprah settled her mother\u2019s debt. Al-though Oprah continues to support her mother and is concerned about her welfare, their relationship is far from close.  When Oprah was eight and had reached the end of her \ufb01  rst term in the Milwaukee schools, Vernita, who was struggling \ufb01  nancially, sent her to her father and stepmother in Nashville, to an environment com-pletely opposite from the one Oprah had been living in. An upstanding person, Vernon Winfrey later in life became a member of the city council. Strongly religious, Vernon Winfrey was a deacon and was very active in his church, Faith United, and he saw to it, as Grandmother Lee had, that Oprah attended all services and youth-oriented activities. The Winfrey home was rigorously run, a place where learning for a child was central, and Zelma, known as a strict discipli-narian, required Oprah to read a certain number of books on a regular basis, write, learn math, and develop a strong vocabulary. Barbara Winfrey was a 59-year-old retired educator, the oldest child in a family of eight, as well as the \ufb01  rst of the family to graduate from college. Her life story is the kind of achievement that Oprah believes is possible for girls who aim high.  Barbara Winfrey has degrees in business education, a master of sci-ence degree in psychology, a master of arts degree in education, and a doctorate in administration. She retired on the sixth anniversary of her marriage to Oprah\u2019s father, whom she had met because of his generosity to her students\u2014that is, troubled teens. Even though Barbara is retired, Vernon Winfrey has no plans to do so himself. However, 48 OPRAH WINFREYshe also plans to get involved in some way in furthering education for others. Over the years, Oprah has spoken of how Duncan inspired her so much that for a time she wanted to become a teacher also. In middle age, Oprah achieved that particu-lar ambition, teaching a graduate credit course called The Dynamics of Leadership with her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, at Northwest-ern University\u2019s J. In 2001, an un-dergraduate course about Oprah was offered. Its description in the catalogue refers to its subject matter as \u201cOprah the Tycoon.  The memory of her early teacher always had a favored place in Oprah\u2019s heart. Nevertheless, in\ufb02  uenced by strong faith and the moral atmosphere of Vernon Winfrey\u2019s home, Oprah decided she\u2019d become a missionary when she grew up, and she even collected money for the poor of Costa Rica.  All of the future promise of the Winfrey household seemed to dissipate for Oprah when she was nine; in the summer of 1963, Oprah\u2019s mother, expecting to be married and hoping to have a real family life, insisted on her return to Wisconsin. Oprah experienced regression in the overcrowded, unsupervised, undisciplined life she\u2019d led before, only worse.  Although she kept the violations a \u201cbig, looming, dark secret\u201d for more than 12 years, Oprah has said that she always believed that her mother knew about them and had failed to protect her.  Her mother\u2019s refusal to discuss the matter was so traumatic that Oprah never brought it up again with her. The identi\ufb01  cation for Oprah was so intense that all her efforts at concealment over the years slipped away in the shared moments of suffering with her guest.  Almost three decades after the abuse \ufb01  rst occurred, when Oprah had become an internationally famous entertainer on television and in \ufb01  lm, she chose to use her celebrity as a means of speaking out against the terrors of child abuse and the secrecy that surrounds it. In 1992, she 50 OPRAH WINFREYintroduced a documentary titled  Scared Silent,  describing her harsh child-hood experiences of rape and molestation by male relatives, among them an uncle, and family friends.\u201d In the picture, Oprah plays a black everywoman. Although the \ufb01 lm speci\ufb01  cally focuses on blacks, when Oprah uses the term  everywoman  to de\ufb01  ne herself, in life, as she presents her talk show and speaks with interviewees, she does not limit her scope to one race or color. The family, in addition to the central \ufb01  gure of the mother, consists of a grandmother played by Oprah\u2019s friend Maya Angelou, an undependable husband/father, and three sons: one already lost to the prison system, one \u201cin the undecided column,\u201d and the youngest, for whom there is still hope. The setting was the Henry Horner public housing project in Chicago, a place that had caught Oprah\u2019s attention for a long period of time as she drove past it on her way to work.  Talking about her experience of \ufb01  lming the project, Oprah said that she gained knowledge and insight into not only people\u2019s needs but also the longings and dreams for their lives that everyone harbors; she came to understand that everyone goes through some basic human circum-stances. Her philosophy of personal responsibility and self-help, as well as her belief in the vital role  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 51of education, is played out in practical ways again and again in all kinds of situations: in talks, interviews, on her television show, and in  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which she started in 2000 with the partnership of the Hearst Corporation, she emphasizes the possibility of change. But Oprah herself asserts that sharing the truth with others is freeing and uplifting. Clever and talented, a good student as well as an ardent reader even then, Oprah was able, with help from a teacher, to change to Nicolet, a newly integrated Milwaukee high school. In their houses, the children would introduce her to their black maids as if all black people should know each other, and they made the same assumption about Oprah\u2019s supposed familiarity with black entertainers. For Oprah, these memories linger. 52 OPRAH WINFREY The year that Oprah attended Nicolet High is also a time that will long be remembered in history. From the period of Oprah\u2019s birth through the decade of the 1960s, upheaval was prevalent.\u201d 12  Throughout the years, many people paid homage to Parks, as did Oprah when she in-cluded the frail, elderly woman as an honored guest at a screening of  Beloved,  held at Marianne Williamson\u2019s Unity Church. Alienated from the South but not from the cause of civil rights, she moved to Chicago, where she founded the \ufb01  rst African American civic group for women and became the \ufb01  rst president of the Negro Fellowship League and chairman of the Equal Rights League  Oprah Winfrey takes the stage to speak during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Martin Luther King, Jr. (AP Photo/Lawrence Jackson) 54 OPRAH WINFREYof Chicago.    Oprah is captivated by the history and powerful heritage left by a few black women. The year Oprah reached the age of six (1962) and moved from Mississippi to Milwaukee was the historic time that another black student, James Meredith, also from Kosciusko (as was Oprah), had to be enrolled by force at the University of Missis-sippi in Oxford.  Of course, Oprah holds no individual knowledge of any of the political events that happened during the early years of her child-hood or half a century before her birth, and she was only a small child when the \ufb01  rst civil rights bills for blacks since Reconstruction in the 19th century were passed.  It isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah, who was not even a teenager in the 1960s, had no concern about politics in her home state and elsewhere. For many years, Oprah maintained a neutral stance about politics. Her one and only foray into the political arena has been for the Democrat candidate for president, Barack Obama.  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 55 Oprah\u2019s early home, Mississippi, has a history of electing Democratic governors and Republican senators.  Oprah has attempted to remain neutral about politics on her tele-vision show. Bush to join a group of of\ufb01  cials on a trip to tour Afghanistan schools; Oprah responded that she was too much in-volved with earlier commitments. That unguarded statement provided media with the chance for some Oprah bashing by people who regarded her response as a political snub of the administration.  Throughout her adult years, Oprah\u2019s concern has not been for politi-cal movements but for the rights of all women everywhere, as well as other individuals whose lives she celebrates. Above all else, education alters everything, and Oprah is passionate about that. With heartfelt admiration for Oprah, Jackson has spoken of the enormity of her contribution in transforming the social structure, an observation echoed hyperbolically in a  Vanity Fair  magazine article characterizing her in\ufb02  uence as greater than almost 56 OPRAH WINFREYanyone on the planet except for the Pope.  Jesse Jackson describes Oprah in the same way she depicts her cher-ished friend Quincy Jones\u2014as a person who lights up the dark places. Oprah\u2019s style of participation in the lives of the underprivileged and Af-rican Americans, however, in the main does not resemble Jackson\u2019s. While Oprah\u2019s bene\ufb01  cence may be directed primarily toward blacks, it isn\u2019t closed to others.  Oprah\u2019s belief in individual accountability is much more pronounced in her advocacy for broader, societal changes, though the exceptions are her calls for stricter gun laws, punishment for those who commit sex crimes against children, and the need for education. At 14, Oprah\u2019s personal problems caught up with her.  Oprah kept secret from her mother the frequent, ongoing attacks by men who came and went in their home. Today she recognizes him as an honor-able man, the person who saved her life\u2014that is, the one who saw to it 58 OPRAH WINFREYthat she became more than an unwed mother. Without the in\ufb02  uence of Vernon Winfrey throughout her adolescent years, she could not have achieved her later success. What the 14-year-old Oprah\u2019s feelings were at the time may not be precisely what the middle-aged woman describes as an \u201copportunity\u201d rather than a loss; the opportunity was a choice for her future. Freed of the oppressions of life in Vernita\u2019s home and of teenage motherhood, Oprah began to show signs of promise, although surely nobody in those days could have predicted her later accomplish-ments. After moving in with the Winfreys once more, she had to follow their strict rules. Zelma, his wife, also required Oprah to do all the things necessary to become an outstanding student.  Surprisingly, reports that Vernon was writing a \u201cshocking\u201d book about Oprah\u2019s childhood, in which he described her as \u201cdisobedient\u201d and \u201cout of hand,\u201d seem completely at odds with Oprah\u2019s recollections, but it is likely that the sources of the stories probably con\ufb02  ated her earlier years at home with Vernita.  When she was about 15, Oprah began to keep a journal, and she has continued to write in it ever since then. In 1971, during the Nixon administration, when two students from each state and from foreign countries were chosen to attend a White House Conference on Youth, Oprah was one of Tennessee\u2019s representatives. Oprah was recommended by John Heidelberg, who, all these years later, still recalls how much he was impressed by both her articulateness and ease before a camera. Other contestants had given expected, typical answers, so Oprah won, becoming the \ufb01  rst black girl to be named Miss Fire Preven-tion. The interview she\u2019d had during her senior year in high school after she 60 OPRAH WINFREYwas chosen as Miss Fire Prevention led to a job reading the news on ra-dio station WVOL. The station, and particularly John Heidelberg, re-membered Oprah\u2019s outgoing personality from that interview; just for fun, she had read some news copy while she was at the station. She had made a favorable impression with her voice and poise, and when the station needed someone to read the news, they offered the job to Oprah. Oprah has never shown any regrets, surely not publicly, about accepting opportunities of that sort.  Oprah\u2019s world was expanding, not only with a job but also through opportunities to do some acting in college and sing with Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all-women\u2019s a capella group in Nashville. Although some books state that Oprah graduated from college in 1976, the fact is that she did not, and the sit-uation is cloudy. Furthermore, Princeton University in 2002 awarded an hon-orary doctorate of \ufb01  ne arts to Oprah. Since that time, Oprah has received many more honorary degrees.     Not long after, another recognition came to Oprah when she received the sixth Marian Anderson Award. Although most people would probably agree that Oprah \ufb01  ts in that category, there are some who question the choice. An unidenti\ufb01  ed writer in  Philebrity: Philly Media, Gossip, Nightlife & Poli-tics  puts her in a group of \u201cthose who have arguably done more harm than good, culturally speaking:  Oprah Winfrey,  anyone.\u201d (emphasis in 62 OPRAH WINFREYoriginal). a Living God to all who serve in Oprah\u2019s Kingdom of Lowered Expectations.\u201d)  As much as Oprah is a target for all kinds of criticism (much of it humorous and even when she is using her celebrity for admirable causes), she is also, of course, the subject of much adulation. When Philadelphia Mayor John Street, in speaking of the 2003 choice of Oprah for the Mar-ian Anderson Award, took note of Oprah\u2019s work in many social pro-grams as well as her generosity to schools at home and in South Africa,  Oprah Winfrey cheers with the crowd at the commencement ceremony for Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, DC, on May 12, 2007. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 63he also pointed to the importance of her television shows that focus on individual self-help. Oprah, said the mayor, serves as \u201ca national men-tor. She called attention to the similarities in Oprah\u2019s and Marian Anderson\u2019s characters; both women, she emphasized, achieved their place in the world through their own abilities and efforts. Several years earlier, Oprah had received the Horatio Alger Award from the association that annually honors those who have triumphed over adversity with their considerable achievements. Almost everyone who mentions Oprah speaks with awe of her astonishing rise from annihilat-ing poverty to her place on the world\u2019s stage.  Many experiences in Oprah\u2019s younger years were similar to those of other black women of her age. However, in what was to become typical of the future star, Oprah disregarded the adverse circumstances, becoming one of the winners in the contest with her reading of a passage from Ntozake Shange\u2019s  For Colored Girls Who Have Contemplated Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,  a play as-signed in many English classes throughout the country. Decades earlier, when Oprah left Nashville to try her wings elsewhere, she was 22, young and unsophisticated in various ways, only at the beginning of the road that would eventually take her to stardom. Starting out, she didn\u2019t do well in her new job as the anchor of the six o\u2019clock evening news on Baltimore\u2019s station, WJZ-TV , the largest station in the 64 OPRAH WINFREYcity. It became apparent very quickly that Oprah wasn\u2019t meant to be a newswoman. She was demoted from her evening anchor position, but a new station manager who liked Oprah\u2019s style found a slot for her with co-host Richard Sher on a morning program called  People Are Talking.   Even though the show was quite popular, Oprah didn\u2019t particularly like working with another host. With the help of a resume expert and an ambitious producer friend, in 1984, at the age of 30, Oprah relocated to Chicago, a city that has the third largest tele-vision market in the country and which she has referred to as a \u201cmore polished New York.  Only two years after her move to Chicago, her show was syndicated, and, in a sense, a star was born\u2014the star of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   When the show went national in 1986, 32-year-old Oprah celebrated Thanksgiving with Vernon and Zelma Winfrey; the three of them took a triumphal trip back to Mississippi, where they revisited family and friends and old haunts from Oprah\u2019s childhood. Today, Grandmother Lee\u2019s house is gone, but the street alongside the property is known as Oprah Winfrey Road. In Kosciusko, Oprah\u2019s celebrity is as great as\u2014or perhaps greater than\u2014it is in other parts of the country. Nashville, somewhat later, also paid tribute to Oprah and her father\u2019s role in her life by naming the street on which Vernon Winfrey\u2019s Beauty and Barber shop is located Vernon Winfrey Avenue, an action in which his wife Barbara had a role.  Renaming the program  The Oprah Winfrey Show  was the act of the King Brothers Corporation, a company owned by two well-known dis-tributors who had purchased the show in September 1986. Although most of their clients were very successful game shows, Oprah was the star in their crown, with a show that brought in many millions for the Kings as well as for Oprah. He predicted 66 OPRAH WINFREYaccurately that syndication would make Oprah rich. Yet, without the Kings, Oprah might never have achieved the exposure she has on television nor the vast sums of money she\u2019s earned. Oprah, like the other entertainers with whom the Kings dealt, has been the recipient of some of their largesse. When does someone like Oprah become \u201ca once colored girl\u201d.   As Oprah gained fame and fortune, she developed an interest in the lives of slaves, and with that came her decision to learn about her own African heritage. Oprah, who wanted to trace her own roots, turned to Gates for guidance.  The search for Oprah\u2019s roots revealed information going back to her matrilineal ancestors in Africa, who were of the Kpelle tribe of Liberia, on the west African coast, which also includes Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast. A further search of Oprah\u2019s maternal ancestors revealed that her great-grandmother, Amanda Winters, had been actively involved in education, and Oprah was understandably delighted. Oprah now has the deed to the property.  68 OPRAH WINFREY Not all black scholars\u2014in fact, not all black Americans\u2014are in-terested in pursuing the course set by Gates. Believing that three decades of af\ufb01  rmative action have \u201cled to the creation of a true black middle class\u201d and that it is time to move beyond the past, he lists the professions in which black Americans have risen to the top of the ladder and mentions Oprah, \u201cthe most prominent talk show host.\u201d Objecting to the views of prominent deniers such as Louis Farrakhan, who claims that \u201csuccessful people like Oprah Winfrey .\u201d  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 69 In her youth, Oprah was inspired by several people, and meeting and talking with them helped her to get her \ufb01  rst talk show. When Oprah took on her Chicago program, Phil Donahue was the leader in the talk show business and people spoke of him as the owner of daytime televi-sion. But Oprah toppled him. Where Donahue was intense, Oprah was easy.  Within a few years of her move to Chicago, the illegitimate daugh-ter of Vernita Lee and Vernon Winfrey became a millionaire and, ac-cording to various reports, among the richest entertainers in the world; additionally,  Forbes  magazine listed her as being one of the wealthiest people in the United States and began to tabulate her wealth, which soon exceeded that of producer Steven Spielberg (who had given her the \ufb01  rst of her movie roles) and Bill Cosby, comedian, television actor, and venerated friend of Oprah. Years later, when  Forbes  ranked the 100 richest people in the world, Oprah made the list as the \ufb01  rst black U. Her fortune continues to grow as she expands her undertak-ings, and journalists continue to speak of Oprah\u2019s enormous wealth.  By 1986, Oprah had earned enough money to buy what most Chi-cagoans dream of\u2014a penthouse condominium on the lakefront with a view from the 57th \ufb02  oor of the lake and the city. Gossip columnists write of the 70 OPRAH WINFREY\u201cfabulous of\ufb01  ce amenities\u201d available to people who work for Harpo: a caf\u00e9 and a workout facility known as Club Harpo, which includes a spa\u2014all of which led one reporter to proclaim, \u201cWe wanna work with Oprah. Oprah is known to be careful about schedules, conscious of attending planned meetings, and she has told journalists that her success with employees comes from her consideration for them: no yelling or mistreatment and no talking down to people.  The amenities at work are echoed in her Chicago apartment, which holds a wine cellar; a marble tub with spigots made to resemble gold dolphins; a tub in which Oprah, known for her love of bubble baths, can soak. Oprah, who loves dogs and owns several (including the much-publicized but now deceased Sophie and Gracie), has a heated house for them. Oprah\u2019s boyfriend, Stedman Graham, had given Solomon to Oprah as a Christmas present in 1994. It read \u201cOPRAH\u2014please do a show on puppy mills; the dogs need you. In December 2008, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals named Oprah as Person of the Year. Furthermore, it has been reported that Sophie, Oprah\u2019s much-loved, deceased dog, had her name on the deed of a penthouse in New York.  In the midst of the devastating \ufb01  re that spread through southern California in November 2008, Oprah, who was not at her newest home in Montecito at that time, said that her \ufb01  rst concern was for her dogs.  Oprah\u2019s love of dogs led to a further purchase and loss. A spokesperson for PA WS issued a state-ment of condolence to Oprah, citing the shelter\u2019s excellent record in controlling the disease and offering advice to prospective owners of young puppies. Oprah\u2019s love of dogs seems never ending. Introduced to Oprah\u2019s studio audience as her \u201cnew babies,\u201d they were dressed in crystal pink collars in celebration of Oprah\u2019s birthday. (Rumor has it that Oprah paid for the home with a personal check. Although Oprah is selective about many details of her private life, parts of the California estate were the focus of photos and narratives about her rose garden and teahouse in the August 2008 issue of  O At Home.) To get from one home to another and to other places easily, Oprah bought a jet plane. Every detail about her life makes the news; thus, it is no surprise to see many, many newspapers writing that Oprah was house hunting in the Washington, DC, area in time for the Obama inaugural events. Despite the denials of intent by Oprah\u2019s staff, the story was widely circulated. So too were reports that Oprah was plan-ning a fabulous party after the inauguration. Among 74 OPRAH WINFREYthem, the most concrete was the decision to produce her television show during the celebrations from the Kennedy Center in Washington.  Oprah\u2019s growing wealth permitted her to make an even more im-portant purchase a number of years ago. At the same time she joined the ranks of the most famous broadcasters\u2014Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, Barbara Walters, Ted Koppel, and others\u2014as Broadcaster of the Year, she acquired ownership and control of  The Oprah Winfrey Show  from the Chicago ABC television af\ufb01  liate WLS and formed the company Harpo.  Oprah is the \ufb01  rst black woman to have her own studio and produc-tion company. was estimated by  Fortune  magazine to be worth $575 million, with Oprah as owner of 90 percent of the stock. In recognition of Oprah\u2019s leadership role in U. The company also is responsible for Oprah\u2019s Web site.  Harpo Print includes all the Oprah publications.  However, on March 4, 2009, the station\u2019s name was changed to Oprah Radio. The plans were to feature familiar Oprah picks, such as her close friends Gayle King and poet 76 OPRAH WINFREYMaya Angelou; designer Nate Berkus, who has been featured in Oprah\u2019s magazines and television shows; Dr. Mehmet Oz, the medical advisor who became a favorite on her television show and soon had his own program; Bob Greene, the \ufb01  tness trainer and author of how-to exercise books; sex therapist Laura Berman, a popular and outspoken guest on Oprah\u2019s television show (said to be hosting the program  Better in Bed  ) and author of  The Book of Love ; \ufb01  nancial expert Jean Chatsky; and other guests from multiple \ufb01  elds.  O ,  The Oprah Magazine  was to have a role in the new program on occasion, and spiritual discussions, poetry, and home matters would be among the subjects. The announced goal of the revised program is a familiar one to Oprah watchers, which is to live your best life., along with Discovery Communication had planned to launch the new Oprah Winfrey Network\u2014OWN\u2014in 2009, under a 50\u201350 partnership agreement between OWN and Dis-covery. (Subscription fees from cable and satellite TV providers are ex-pected to rise once Oprah moves over from broadcast networks after 2011.) However, despite all the hoopla about the relationship of Oprah and Discovery Communications, the early agreement hit several snags. Currently, it isn\u2019t known how much of a presence Oprah will have on the programs. She had been named president in 2008 but resigned. Not surprisingly, given all the publicity about the coming venture and Oprah\u2019s star power, the paper trade named Oprah the most powerful woman of 2008 in the world of entertainment.   Oprah\u2019s desire to give back to others something of what had been given to her led to her creation of another kind of network. However, after 12 years, Oprah is closing it as soon as the remaining funds have been spent. Her two major charities\u2014the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation\u2014are not affected. Much of what motivates Oprah is her desire to do good and, like the missionary she once dreamed of becoming, to bring a mes-sage of goodness to others. From the beginning, participants in the Angel Network, with another famous 78 OPRAH WINFREYcharitable group, Habitat for Humanity, have provided homes to thou-sands of families and have funded college scholarships that allow needy and meritorious students to seek higher education. When Oprah has a sale of items in her Chicago shop, money from Oprah\u2019s Closet has been do-nated to her Angel network. Oprah has now changed the focus of her broadcasting and gone in an-other direction.  Nevertheless, Oprah could be a poster \ufb01  gure for the advertisement \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby. Four decades later, a middle-aged Oprah, remembering those childhood days and longings, talked to the spring 1997 graduating Wellesley College senior class about the journey they would take into the future.  It took Oprah a long time and many lessons to discover we can only be ourselves, not somebody else, no matter how admirable that some-body might be. Living that way, Oprah main-tains, is central to one\u2019s survival.  Several years later, Oprah agreed to be the speaker at the Duke Uni-versity commencement of her godson, Will Bumpus. Will is the son of Gayle King, Oprah\u2019s closest friend. In an interview, goddaughter Kirby told a student writer for the  Duke Chronicle,  \u201cOprah doesn\u2019t really do commencements\u201d unless she has a special connection to the person who asks her. Obviously, students at Duke bene\ufb01  ted from the Oprah con-nection; the majority at Duke, when the news was announced, appeared to be struck by Winfrey\u2019s star power. That star power was evident as she 80 OPRAH WINFREYreturned to Duke to ful\ufb01  ll her promise; she arrived to cheers and cries of love from the students.  Duke administrators noted their delight in Oprah\u2019s acceptance of the invitation, following it up via e-mail with the notice that Oprah will receive \u201can honorary doctor of humane letters degree\u201d at the ceremony. The degree, as described in the e-mail, is in recognition of Oprah\u2019s use of her celebrity to further education and literacy and other \u201cimportant causes.\u201d Because Oprah usually declines such awards, the vice president for public affairs and government relations (without mentioning Oprah\u2019s \u201cspecial connection\u201d) considers her acceptance as \u201ca testament to [her] great esteem and respect\u201d for Duke. Protective as she is of them, she could not keep newspapers from reporting in October 2009 that Kirby played a role in the \ufb01  ring of two members of the staff of Oprah\u2019s private plane.  From the time Oprah realized she\u2019d been given a second chance in life by her father, she has worked unceasingly not only on her career but also to build an image outside the world of entertainment. Among the many important roles she has played, one of the most meaningful took place after the catastrophic events of September 2001, when, as master of ceremonies, Oprah led an interfaith ceremony at Yankee Stadium  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 81in New York. Through talks, music, and writing, Oprah has addressed the speci\ufb01  city of loss and despair as well as other wrenching issues of life, probing the dark places and the light of possibility.   Barbara Grizzutti Harrison, \u201cThe Importance of Being Oprah,\u201d  New York Times Magazine,  11 June 1989.    \u201c  \u2018It Is Constant Work\u2019: Oprah on Staying Centered, Ambition, Letting Go\u2014and Pajamas,\u201d interview by Lynette Clemetson,  Newsweek,   8 Jan. 82 OPRAH WINFREY  11 .", "Oprah_Winfrey_2009": " Of the seven Kurtz chose from both day-time and nighttime talk shows, Oprah was the only woman. The subject matter of both daytime and evening programs may be the same\u2014that is, serious and important\u2014but 84 OPRAH WINFREYthe presentations have been worlds apart.\u201d Through her show and magazine, which reveal Oprah as a salesper-son of sentiment, good feeling, and self-improvement, Timson writes, \u201cWe have been given a transformative way to view our lives.  Perhaps the most basic reason for Oprah\u2019s ongoing popularity is the one given by an Internet entertainment writer, who saw her as \u201ca best girl friend to women. Numerous pages of angry blogs appeared on the Internet when Oprah refused to have Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on her show prior to the 2008 election. When Oprah did invite Sarah Palin to appear on her show after the election, the former candidate turned her down. However, once Palin had re-signed her position as Alaska\u2019s governor and had a book to market, she changed her mind and appeared on Oprah\u2019s show in November 2009, a year after the election. Oprah\u2019s role the critics found ei-ther sycophantic or supportive.  Inspired perhaps by Palin\u2019s mention of porn, the following day, Oprah returned to the type of discussion she had eschewed for awhile. As Michael Langston wrote in the  Examiner , \u201cOprah .\u201d That and the title of 86 OPRAH WINFREYthe lead story, \u201cMy Own Love Trap,\u201d could easily be today\u2019s program on television, not excluding Oprah\u2019s show (though the details of the story would surely have been far less explicit in the past).  Oprah\u2019s life is a favorite subject for these publications. First Lady Michelle Obama became the \ufb01  rst person to share the cover of Oprah\u2019s magazine since it was introduced. Interviews with presidential wives, not only on television but also in the magazine, have added to Oprah\u2019s cachet. Even a stand-in Oprah appeared on one of the programs. Oprah seemed not to object to the comedy show during the run-up to the election. Many of Oprah\u2019s shows have supported such discussions of intimate matters. She pushed 88 OPRAH WINFREYthe boundaries of transgender by having as a guest the \u201cpregnant\u201d Thomas Beatie, a transsexual who was on the show more than once and is a man who has twice given birth.  Programs on sexual matters display many characteristics of Oprah\u2019s presentations, not only those dealing with intimate matters that ac-count for her large numbers of fans: before-and-after photos of guests, intimate relations, emotion, and humor.  Because of public interest\u2014or prurient interest\u2014in the matter of sex changes, the following year, staff from Harpo noti\ufb01  ed an Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, woman of the plan for Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show to have a program on sex-change surgery. Although there was no immediate date for Oprah\u2019s show, the studios were considering the subject of trans- MEDIA MOGUL 89sexuals.  Oprah had featured an entire episode introducing Skype to her viewers. Through the use of Skype, Oprah has been able to hold talks with anyone, anywhere, at any hour. And Oprah, who appears always ready to try new things, uses Facebook, YouTube, and T witter (al-though, reportedly, she has tired of this last one). So too did Oprah\u2019s.  When Oprah started in Chicago in 1984, nobody anticipated the effect her program would have. Having replaced the irreplaceable Phil 90 OPRAH WINFREYDonahue, she always credits him for his pioneering work on television in creating the one topic format that she emulated. In much the same way, Oprah has become more in-volved in other types of programs. Nevertheless, some of the criticism of Oprah by media critics still is valid. Writ-ers have noted occasions when Oprah became uncomfortable with the subjects on her program; though she appears to be less so with the pas-sage of time, it is re\ufb02  ective of changes in our culture. In that lineup, Oprah\u2019s programs have generally been ranked at the classy end in both style and execution, leading to her top ratings and many Emmy Awards, in-cluding a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Substantive alterations took place in Oprah\u2019s telecasts once she de-cided to raise the level of her programs. During the years that competi-tion increased among daytime talk shows and subject matter became more repugnant,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  made important strides toward abandoning the tawdry factor. The anti-Oprah critics voice dismay at the role she plays in U. 92 OPRAH WINFREYClasses in literature often study the book, and the movie was Oprah\u2019s introduction as an actress; the show also was a hit on Broadway and elsewhere, with the current producer being Oprah Winfrey.\u201d The subject is one that Oprah has been interested in for years, primarily because of her own painful history as an abused, neglected child, raped by a family member and her mother\u2019s boyfriend.  There will be many more \ufb01  lms on Oprah\u2019s new network.\u201d No doubt the lives of women will continue to be a major theme and interest in Oprah\u2019s future work, just as her television programs have been.  Divorce has been a topic shown from several perspectives on Oprah\u2019s program. On another Oprah program, the issue of loyalty and disloyalty was explored, with guests consisting of a father and his two  MEDIA MOGUL 93children, Daisy and Chris, as well as a divorce counselor.  After Oprah asserted it is never too late to heal damage, another \ufb01  lm was shown on the program, featuring the same counselor and a 16-year-old girl, Ebony, who felt guilty about telling her father years earlier she had seen her mother embracing another man.  Oprah takes the opportunity to express a point of view she holds strongly: it is necessary for parents to talk to their children in situations of this nature. 94 OPRAH WINFREY Both Oprah and Neuman are in agreement that children need adults to talk to about important personal matters, and if they can\u2019t discuss such things with their parents, there must be adult friends to whom the children can turn. People familiar with Oprah\u2019s history understand the impetus behind her views. In support of such \ufb01  ndings, on one Oprah program, Oprah\u2019s guest, a professor from the University of Utah, discussed her 13-year study about women\u2019s sexuality, which resulted in the book  Sexual Fluidity.  Years ago, when Oprah decided to improve the nature of her pro-gram, more professional guests were added, so that a number of the is-sues discussed have had serious and thoughtful analysis. On days when the country has been eager for solace as well as information about signi\ufb01  cant current events such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economy, or careful consideration of other major happenings,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  attained stature commensurate with some of the best television offerings.  When Oprah has experienced certain health issues herself, the entire world learns about her physical ailments while she shares personal in-formation.  Several years ago, an Oprah program about postpartum depression explored the grim subject of mothers who injured or killed their chil-dren. It followed the structure of most Oprah shows, with different sto-ries, taped segments, testimony by some of those affected, an expert advisor\u2014usually a doctor\u2014and research data. The program provided much information and was different from the carnival setting and at-mosphere that often has surrounded other media presentations of the 96 OPRAH WINFREYsubject.  Emotion on Oprah\u2019s show is not always focused on the sorrowful.  Oprah periodically has taken to the road with a \u201cLive Your Best Life\u201d tour. It is not known whether Oprah will take it out on the road again.  During a two-hour morning program, Oprah spoke about her child-hood on her grandmother\u2019s farm in Mississippi, and she spoke about her trip to Africa during the Christmas season.\u201d The two-hour afternoon sharing session, with speakers se-lected by Oprah, focused on the same types of problems aired then and now on her television shows: marriage, sickness, and weight. Another critic disputes Oprah\u2019s authenticity, labeling her a con artist.  Such behavior is attractive to the audience, and being seemingly unscripted allows Oprah to use her special type of humor that her au-dience delights in.\u201d Oprah seems to \ufb01  nd laughter in much that others would not. She engages the 100 OPRAH WINFREYaudience in the fun not only verbally but through body language\u2014a raised eyebrow, exaggerated eye movements, and other facial expres-sions and gestures. Oprah so enjoys shopping, not only for herself but for many other people, that her enthusiasm becomes infectious.  A serious subject that Oprah returns to periodically is bullying. Abduction of girls is a more alarming part of that pattern, a topic that Oprah has been determined to bring before the public. In attempting to keep the different types of violence an ongoing subject for her audience, Oprah wanted to interview Jaycee Dugard, a young woman who had been kidnapped 18 years before being found alive.  Oprah, always determined to explore the hidden and secret elements of bullying that becomes violent, chose to bring the subject of domestic violence to her show in a program called \u201cThe Rihannas of the World. Be-cause of that, he thought Oprah should have been more helpful to him. Finally, the message reached Oprah, who then barred the singer from her show. The transplant saved her, although her photographs reveal a woman whose face can never be considered 102 OPRAH WINFREYnormal.  When Culp told Oprah she had considered taking Thomas back after completion of his prison term, Oprah asked her for reasons, which seemed inexplicable to both Oprah and her audience. In May 2009, Oprah\u2019s show focused on the deaths of two 11-year-old boys, one from the island of Saint Croix and one from Georgia. Vulnerability in children is a topic Oprah has returned to again and again.  Still another Oprah program, as well as one on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show,  featured the bereaved mother of an 11-year-old boy who had committed suicide.  Violence as a social issue in the United States has long been an im-portant subject for Oprah.\u2019s, birthday, Oprah announced that she would undertake the topics of racism and the judicial system and race rela-tions. On all Oprah programs, advertising, which occurs every few minutes, consumes huge amounts of time. On one program after Oprah called attention to a medicinal com-pound that supposedly enhances a woman\u2019s sex drive, she brought on a \ufb02 urry of phone calls to a small Maryland pharmacy making the custom mixture.  No matter the product, many affected companies have remarked on Oprah\u2019s extraordinary in\ufb02  uence on sales. Because of the con\ufb01  dence she has instilled in audiences, they will follow her recommendations, says the president of a branch of a publishing company, so that Oprah \u201ccre-ates markets all the time. But as Oprah gives prices, she soft-ens the fact that she is advertising, humorously noting that she wants the discount being offered. Finding almost everything Oprah does to be manip-ulative, commercial, and self-serving, one disgruntled former employee of Harpo published a screed about the star on the Internet. Claiming that Oprah has business ties or a quid pro quo arrangement with many 106 OPRAH WINFREYcorporations, networks, and publishing houses, the writer calls her a world-class phony who is able to deliver audiences because her name sells everything, and companies are not interested in how she does that. A book called  Everybody Loves Oprah  quotes and names some hostile journalists. Bednarski of the  Chicago Sun-Times,  who wrote 20 years ago that Oprah was amoral about sexual matters and uninvolved with important moral and social issues. In the two decades that have passed since Bednarski criticized Oprah, many of her activities, as well as the praise she has earned for them, contradict Bednarski\u2019s statement. Because Oprah herself often voices her unhappiness when she gains weight, it became an important issue. However, Oprah\u2019s appearance over the years\u2014her hairdos, makeup, jewelry, and clothing\u2014reveal her as savvy about her looks. An Indian writer, Shraddha Jahagirdar-Saxena, however, points to Oprah\u2019s ability to reach out to everyone\u2014that is, \u201cthe common man\u201d\u2014with issues that affect many, such as weight, abuse, and discrimination.  Although not all talk shows nor their audiences are the same, Oprah\u2019s live audience generally is 80 percent white, middle class, and female, and they want to hear about the problems of other women, even though the guests may very well conform to a different social, cultural, or economic group than the viewers. Such was the case with the story actress Mackenzie Phillips told on Oprah\u2019s show in September 2009, when she talked about her book and the \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d she had with her father. Almost without excep-tion, viewers speak affectionately and admiringly of Oprah. Some, who 110 OPRAH WINFREYfollow every story about her, talk as if a close relationship exists between them and the star. Journal-ists write of occasions when Oprah has left the stage to hug a member of the audience who has revealed a traumatic experience. Where some hosts hold a microphone while walking around, Oprah will sometimes sit in the audience and, on occasion speak with a few people during the break. All of this is true of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   The audience at an Oprah show only appears to be selected at ran-dom. Cars are but one of 112 OPRAH WINFREYthe items audiences have been gifted with. Oprah wanted the audience to experience the feeling she has\u2014that gift giving is a source of happiness.  Oprah\u2019s show is usually taped several weeks in advance of its airing, providing the producers the opportunity to edit it and exercise some control over what is shown.  Many writers\u2014journalists and scholars alike\u2014have emphasized the fact that Oprah is a highly visible black entertainer, but her audiences are predominantly white. Some of these perceptions result from Oprah\u2019s earlier re-moteness from both political activism and the civil rights movement. 114 OPRAH WINFREYHowever, it has also been pointed out that the commercial aspect of her show\u2014that is, the advertising\u2014requires maintenance of a neutral stance on race.  In her series on racism, however, Oprah did not remain neutral.  One black member of Oprah\u2019s audience in 1992 challenged the views expressed, telling her: \u201cListen Oprah, when you leave your show, you go to a lavish home.\u201d Oprah has been faulted for failing to pursue the matter of inequality in politics and economics. Similar to the framing of the race series, a number of Oprah Winfrey program subjects are topical matters that have been discussed in other media. Individual transformation is a staple, a building block in Oprah\u2019s philosophy, something she returns to again and again on the air and in person. After leaks and ongoing speculation among television speakers and watchers, Oprah tearfully announced she was going to bring her net-work talk show to an end early in 2011. They pointed to Oprah\u2019s savvy and almost unerring choices in her work of the last 25 years. Chicago writer Mark Brown for the  Chicago Sun-Times  mentioned rumors that Jerry Roper, president and CEO of the Chicagoland Cham-ber of Commerce, said that Oprah has been more than \u201ca local icon.  A number of names have surfaced as possible replacements for Oprah\u2019s show\u2014more and more of them as the date draws closer for Oprah\u2019s departure. Shortly after Oprah made her announce-ment, Stewart also made hers. T wo well-known people whose positions 116 OPRAH WINFREYon almost everything are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Oprah have been mentioned as possible replacements for Oprah.  As for Oprah, says her closest friend, Gayle King, there should not be, nor will there be, a \u201cpity party.\u201d After all, Oprah is leaving the pro-gram by choice and nothing else. A poll taken by the  Chicago Sun-Times   found, after Oprah\u2019s announcement of future change, that she remains America\u2019s favorite TV personality. Janice Peck, \u201cTalk about Racism: Framing a Popular Discourse of Race on  Oprah Winfrey, \u201d  Cultural Critique  (Spring 1994).", "Oprah_Winfrey_2007": " As is typical in many communities, word of Oprah\u2019s visit spread quickly, and outside the house women began \u201cululating the . freedom line of the 1980\u2019s,\u201d but it soon became \u201cViva, Oprah Winfrey.\u201d  In 2003, ground was broken in the town of Henley-on-Klip for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls located south of Johan-nesburg, South Africa. Oprah told a reporter she hoped the school would be \u201ca re\ufb02  ection\u201d of her. Comprising 52 acres on a 28-building campus of dormitories, 144 OPRAH WINFREYan audiovisual center, gym, and tennis courts, it is, as one new student called it, a \u201cfairy tale come true. As Oprah cut the ribbon, the \ufb02  ags of South Africa and the United States were raised simultaneously, bring-ing tears to her eyes. When questioned about the racial backgrounds of the girls and how they were chosen, Oprah stated that all the girls had been interviewed, and among the interviewees were black, white, Asian, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian girls.    All the girls selected personally by Oprah came from poverty but were A students. The maximum family income for any of the chosen girls must be under $700 per month, a great contrast to that of Oprah\u2014also a child of pov-erty, who is now said to be the richest African American of the century.\u201d  Oprah is one of the most generous philanthropists on the globe, and the recipients of that generosity are the children of the world. Oprah has said, several times, she never had children, and now she can bring up the children of others. talk show host Oprah Winfrey, center front, applauds with schoolgirls in Johannesburg, on August 20, 2006, during her visit to South Africa to interview prospective pupils for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. (AP Photo/Benny Gool)146 OPRAH WINFREY The greatest problem Oprah expected for the students was in the African perception and treatment of women in a culture that does not value them, and Oprah \ufb01  nds it vital that those girls, as well as other fe-males, become conscious of \u201ctheir own power and possibility.\u201d 2  Winfrey frequently says \u201cshe wants to nurture kids.  Oprah wants the girls to have the happy childhood she never had, with education as the way forward. Apparently, Oprah\u2019s support of candidate Obama did not interfere with Simmons\u2019s gift to her academy. However, Oprah\u2019s major philanthropic interest is said to be Africa, where Oprah and her Angel Network have contributed a large amount of money to 40 or more organizations, many of them in Africa,  SCHOOLS 147though not nearly the amount given through her personal foundation. 3  When Oprah had Cher on her program several years ago, the conversation turned to angels, at which point Oprah wondered whether there were any black angels, because she had never seen any. All of these have become part of The Oprah Collection in which the only work without wings is a \ufb01  gure of Rosa Parks, whom Oprah calls \u201cher personal angel.\u201d  The Oprah Winfrey Operating Foundation is the organization that is responsible for her Leadership Academy in Gauteng, South Africa. To people who question why Oprah built her academy in South Africa, her response is that she felt it was insuf\ufb01  cient to always give money to charities. A number of bloggers were critical of her choices, complain-ing that Oprah was seeking glory for herself with her efforts in Africa. 148 OPRAH WINFREY Furthermore, domestically, Oprah continues to give funds to some of her U. It has been written that Oprah\u2019s leader-ship academy was modeled after Miss Porter\u2019s school. An emotional Oprah talked of the experiences the children had before they came to the school, and the girls themselves told stories of their lives of deprivation. Even though the school has outstanding facili-ties and provides the girls with every opportunity to learn about music and the arts, Oprah has tried to enlarge their experiences in a world unfamiliar to them. Although Oprah refers to the girls at her academy as her daughters, Ma-donna clearly wanted a more personal relationship with the children, and she made news with her adoption of a baby boy from Malawi. Oprah\u2019s outlay 150 OPRAH WINFREYwas $40 million before her academy opened in 2007. Typical of that money-raising activity was an auction of 150 pieces of Oprah\u2019s clothing in early 2010. If a less famous person than Oprah were selling clothing on eBay, it would not be news covered by journalists, but the elegance of the clothing, as columnist Amanda Pendolino wrote, was the typical \u201cclassy and gorgeous\u201d Oprah style: a Carolina Herrera dress of purple; two evening bags\u2014one a Bottega Veneta and one a quilted Chanel; a pair of red suede open-toe heels by Prada; satin pumps by Jimmy Choo; a pair of pointed-toe Prada boots; and on and on.  Oprah\u2019s life is so busy, and not everything is reported, even though it often seems that the press follows her every move. For example, a local paper in Newark, New Jersey, the  Star-Ledger,  reported a $500,000 gift that Oprah made in 2009 to St. In thank-ing Oprah in a public statement, Booker spoke of the large numbers\u2014 SCHOOLS 151hundreds and hundreds\u2014of families in his city who are being helped because of Oprah\u2019s commitment to serving others.  In 2007, another dimension had been added to Oprah\u2019s philan-thropy: a new program called Oprah\u2019s Ambassadors, which was a combi-nation partnership between the Angel Network and Free the Children. cities have bene\ufb01  tted as well, even though there is not the same cachet attached to their names as Oprah\u2019s Leadership Academy. It also has been the recipient of million-dollar gifts from Oprah\u2019s foun-dations. Money is raised 152 OPRAH WINFREYnot only by donations from individuals and corporations but also fund-raising entertainment.  Oprah\u2019s engagement with the various leadership schools has many facets, including activities to further the training of members of the staffs. A Cape Town young woman who had graduated with a degree in psychology became the single candidate from the continent to be given an Oprah scholarship to New York University, where she would study for a master\u2019s degree. Even though Oprah is often called the most in\ufb02  uential person\u2014or one of the most in\ufb02  uential people\u2014in the world, not everything becomes wine and roses. Although Oprah is commended by millions of admirers, others take note of her failures. When she failed to \ufb01  nd work in Philadelphia after she\u2019d lost her position in Africa, she claimed that the scandal and Oprah\u2019s remarks about her were the source of her problem. 154 OPRAH WINFREY As usual, bloggers wrote pro and con remarks about the event, but, typically, Oprah\u2019s staff released no further information about the mat-ter, and that was the end. But bloggers, who are often venomous in their anonymous comments, accused Oprah of lying and several called her \u201cDoperah. Needless to say, the case received wide publicity because of Oprah\u2019s fame.\u201d  Oprah herself did not attend the African trial and would not dis-cuss it in speci\ufb01  cs, although she had sent a U. Those comments Oprah did make were about reaction to the events that disrupted life at the school. Oprah apologized to the parents of the girls, speaking not only of her feelings but also her concern that she had disappointed them. Although Oprah asked the girl to return, also meeting for two hours with the family to discuss the situation, the girl preferred to return to her former school.  Oprah\u2019s unhappiness about the situation was clear in the few public statements she made. In April 2009, newspapers reported another sex scandal during which seven students were suspended, although only one of them received notice that she\u2019d been found guilty of sexual contact with another student; 156 OPRAH WINFREYof harassment; of bullying; and dishonesty in denying the truth when questioned by investigators.  In 2008, Oprah cautiously began the search for a new headmistress for the academy, choosing the managing director of the organization Search Associates to head the recruitment for someone with interna-tional experience. Oprah, who likes to be in control of most of her projects, showed a strong interest in \ufb01  nding an Australian teacher. Major had been chosen as the 2007 Australian Youth of the Year; undoubtedly, Oprah\u2019s interest in indigenous people and culture had been a factor in the invitation. 7  In a  Post  column written 10 months later, Robinson scolds Oprah: \u201cThis Isn\u2019t About Oprah.\u201d At the end of his column, however, he offers an olive branch, saying Oprah does know the most \u201csacred trust\u201d is in \u201ccaring for other people\u2019s children.\u201d 8   A blogger, who gave his name and spoke of his country as South Africa, pointed out that he was not being unpatriotic when he was 158 OPRAH WINFREYcritical of Oprah\u2019s undertaking.\u201d However, he questions anyone\u2019s desire to provide \u201ca Western solution to an African problem\u201d and, in particular, Oprah\u2019s plans to give the girls all kinds of luxuries they have never known but which will make \u201cleaders\u201d of them. Can Oprah succeed where others have failed. In the academy there is on display a painting of Oprah carrying a child. It had been given to her by a woman in Texas who wanted to bring Oprah\u2019s atten-tion to those who struggle with terrible diseases. Using what she had learned from Eckhart Tolle\u2019s book,  The Power of Now,  Oprah decided she would deal with the situations as they arise.\u201d A determined Oprah was ready to start again. Roger Friedman, \u201cOprah\u2019s Charities Worth More Than 200 Mil-lion,\u201d Fox News, 5 Jan. Oprah has said this many, many times in many places, as well as in  O . 160 OPRAH WINFREY  3 .

Oprah\u2019s focus on healthy bodies and minds helped make her a top player in television, radio, and publishing, but it has been her unplanned as well as her planned engagements that revealed the extent of her in\ufb02  u-ence on consumers.

However, much has been also going on behind the scenes while Oprah along with her staff and colleagues deter-mined the direction OWN would take.\u201d  Anyone who has the least familiarity with Oprah\u2019s show or maga-zines knows about her lifelong battle with food and weight and her challenges over the years with one diet or another. Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Some programs will be partly original shows, and some will focus on Oprah. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion. Berkus has been signi\ufb01  cant in  O, The Oprah Magazine,   but now that the decision has been made to shift the taping of the daily Oprah television program to New York, the future is cloudy for Chicagoans such as Berkus, even though the announcement was made that Harpo, with its many branches, will remain in the city, and Oprah has opened another shop in Chicago, indicating she is not cutting entirely her con-nection to Chicago.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.  Advertising Age  made the point that Oprah\u2019s friend Gayle King (who also is editor-at-large for  O, The Oprah Magazine ) was given Dove\u2019s \ufb01  rst Real Beauty Award. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following.  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)180 OPRAH WINFREYstatement that those to whom much is given have the obligation to give much to others, and her intention is just that. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King. Although King shares many, many activities with Oprah and has become a prominent \ufb01  gure on her own in television and radio, as well as in Oprah\u2019s publications, both women scorn the implications of the press, and both have also stated there is no shame in anyone\u2019s being gay.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.   Oprah Winfrey has a hug from poet Maya Angelou during the Uncommon Height Award of the National Council of Negro Women, honoring Oprah Winfrey in Washington, DC, on June 4, 2009.

Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. descended from Adam and Eve,\u201d and Oprah, as evolving \u201cby chance .\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.

The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration.

LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 189 Although it was Oprah who made Tolle famous, one might question the idea that she alone is entirely responsible for his overwhelming success. 16   At times it seems that Oprah does nothing but work, travel for busi-ness, give talks, appear on shows other than her own, and on and on. Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

Louis Bayard, review of  Oprah: A Biography,  by Kitty Kelley,  Washington Post,  Book World, 15 Apr.", "Oprah_Winfrey_2002": " Chapter 7  OPRAH\u2019S YELLOW BRICK ROAD  Years ago \u2014 at the end of \ufb01  lming  The Color Purple  \u2014 Quincy Jones told Oprah, \u201cYour future is so bright that it\u2019s going to burn your eyes.\u201d For a long time, Oprah would repeat the statement, but it is now so obviously true, neither she nor others have to say it. One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. Schools were segregated, and most women had returned to their homes to raise families after World 192 OPRAH WINFREYWar II, while men went back to their jobs, went to universities, and re-claimed their roles as heads of family. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom.\u201d  Despite the dif\ufb01  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah\u2019s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life.)  In middle age, a grateful, happy Oprah is suggesting just that. Even though she has been harshly at-tacked in pulpits, books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs by numerous  OPRAH\u2019S YELLOW BRICK ROAD 193members of traditional religions, she has always moved on. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television \u201cas one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: \u201cWhen you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters. It is little wonder that entertainer Zach Braff was led to say in 2007, \u201cIn television, there\u2019s  Oprah,  and then there\u2019s everyone else.

A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign. This was a \ufb01  rst for Oprah, who had attempted to be impartial in previous campaigns. When interviewed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Oprah\u2019s closest friend, Gayle King, stated that she and Oprah think of politics differently. Oprah generally has little interest in politics, but Gayle is completely immersed in everything political and describes herself as someone who \u201ceat[s], sleep[s] and breathe[s] politics.\u201d For Oprah, Obama made the difference. By endorsing her longtime friend, Oprah thought her personal participation was more valuable than money; Obama\u2019s popularity went up, but her involvement affected her own ratings adversely.  From the time she \ufb01  rst announced her political partisanship, there was a steady drop in the numbers of people who would be likely to vote for an Oprah choice. Some reporters claimed that white women were angry at Obama but not at Oprah; it also has been attributed to women who had great hopes to see a woman (Hillary Clinton) elected. One headline captured this sentiment with \u201cOprah\u2019s talk show crown slipping.\u201d Another, an eye-catching headline on May 29, 2008, in the tabloid  Star Magazine  questioned: \u201cHas Oprah passed her expiration date.\u201d Comedian Roseanne Barr went further in her blog than most liberals in her attack on Oprah (as well as aiming a verbal barrage at a number of other well-known Democrats, whom she accused of wanting to lose the election by nominating Barack Obama). Her most hostile, and somewhat hysterical, language, however, was directed at Oprah. Barr stated, Oprah \u201calways gets her republican friends elected.\u201d Ad-ditionally, Barr wrote that Oprah succeeded in splitting the women\u2019s vote and destabilizing the entire Democratic Party. 3  Yet only a few years earlier, Roseanne had lavished praise on Oprah.  The friendliest advice Oprah might have followed was given by a  Los Angeles Times  writer after Obama failed to gain more votes than Hillary Clinton in Indiana: \u201cHer [Oprah\u2019s] estimated fortune of Democratic presidential hopeful, Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., his wife Michelle, right, and Oprah Winfrey wave to the crowd at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Although Rich agrees that Oprah is a \u201cmegaceleb-rity,\u201d he pointed out that \u201cselling presidents is not the same as pushing  Anna Karenina.\u201d Rich quoted a laudatory description of Oprah from Billy Graham\u2019s evangelical journal,  Christianity T oday:  She is \u201can icon of church-free spirituality,\u201d and her beliefs \u201ccannot simply be dismissed as super\ufb01  cial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble.\u201d In contrast, a group of evangelical Christians, labeling Oprah \u201cthe queen of the new age gurus,\u201d places her among those \u201cwho are sucking millions of people into false doctrines.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Yet, regardless of the polls about Oprah\u2019s television rat-ings, it seems her support of Obama provided an important in\ufb02  uence on more than a million voters. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime.\u201d  Multiple reports that previously were doubtful or negative about Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence in the campaign soon reversed, \ufb01  nding that she had given a huge boost to Obama; famed longtime reporter, David Broder, writing during the campaign in Iowa, told of the enormous crowds never before seen in the history of Iowa caucuses. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. Many newspapers, including some in Europe, made much of a publi-cist\u2019s spokesperson\u2019s announcement that Oprah would be in Denver\u2019s Invesco Field football stadium for the nomination of Barack Obama; they also quoted Gayle King\u2019s statements that Oprah would not address the crowds. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah.   The  Chicago Sun-Times  has an Oprah-dedicated blogger, Mark Bieganski, who calls his blog \u201cIt\u2019s all about Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. As  New York Times  writer Alexandra Stanley has said of Oprah, she has \u201cnever concealed her messianic sense of purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Of all the areas that Oprah has been involved in, selling real estate isn\u2019t one. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. Oprah served in that capacity following the national disaster of September 11, 2001. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input.\u201d Vernon Winfrey\u2019s book will not appear. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press.\u201d In a lengthy \u201cBlack Agenda Radio Interview\u201d hosted by Brace Dixon, Peck agrees that she regards Oprah\u2019s message as politi-cal, a politics \u201cthat puts the personal responsibility for being poor and oppressed exclusively on the poor and oppressed.  Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr.

One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom.\u201d  Despite the dif\ufb01  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah\u2019s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life.)  In middle age, a grateful, happy Oprah is suggesting just that. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television \u201cas one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: \u201cWhen you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters. It is little wonder that entertainer Zach Braff was led to say in 2007, \u201cIn television, there\u2019s  Oprah,  and then there\u2019s everyone else.

Mississippi is also the birthplace of Oprah Winfrey, perhaps the most famous black entertainer ever, known throughout the world for her work in television as well as her philanthropic, educational, and social efforts. The project took place in eight communities in Oprah\u2019s home state of Mississippi as well as Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. He ed-its an article each month on Oprah\u2019s Web site and frequently contrib-utes to her magazine. Smith\u2019s latest restaurant is on Capitol Hill, in the Liaison Hotel, where a postinaugural 2008 live television Oprah show was \ufb01  lmed as part of the election week festivities. (Rumors beforehand,  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 27resembling those in Colorado, placed Oprah\u2019s whereabouts in multiple parts of the city; the most intriguing detail generally is the cost of ho-tels and amenities for Oprah\u2014in this case, $15,000 per night. Oprah, on Smith\u2019s 50th birthday, donated $250,000 to his non-pro\ufb01  t charity Common Threads. Elvis was so newsworthy that everything he did seemed to be recorded, and there are people who look at Oprah through a lens similar to Elvis\u2019s, though she is very much alive and constantly in the news. Oprah often speaks of the books that af-fected her most in growing up, and, in an issue of her now-defunct  O At Home  magazine, she reminisced about them. When, in adulthood, Oprah and some of her friends have spoken of these mat-ters, their words re\ufb02  ect the books, poems, and stories that are part of the United States\u2019 literary and cultural heritage. Oprah and various friends have lived these stories. Oprah\u2014as well as Elvis\u2014is a prime example of that effect. Oprah recently learned she is a distant cousin of a famous gospel music singer, Mavis Staples. However, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most famous celebrities in the world, was born in a little-known area of Mississippi. In the middle of the 20th century, when Oprah was born, there was scarcely more variety of work than there had been a hundred or two hundred years earlier. Psychologists and psychiatrists have stated that the \ufb01  rst \ufb01 ve years determine much of who and what we are, and if we accept that thesis, we must apply it to Oprah, even though in most ways she does not appear to \ufb01  t the Southern image. And Angelou, 32 OPRAH WINFREYwho is always identi\ufb01  ed as a Southerner, lived in many parts of the country and elsewhere but \ufb01  nally settled in North Carolina. In con-trast, Oprah, who spent more years in the South than either Capote or Angelou, turned her back on it, saying at various times throughout the years that she knew when she moved to Chicago at 30 that she had found her home.  Although Oprah always credits two members of her family\u2014her ma-ternal grandmother, Hattie Mae Lee, and her father, Vernon Winfrey\u2014with the qualities that have led to her success, her memories of child-hood and early years are \ufb01  lled with more pain and sadness than joy. Those hardships, re\ufb02  ected in many of her interests and activities, are recognizable to all Oprah watchers, some of whom share similar experiences.  A series of accidents are part of Oprah\u2019s heritage; she was born ille-gitimate, the child of two very young people. Vernita re-cently modi\ufb01  ed her story once again, insisting that Vernon is the only person who could be Oprah\u2019s father.  Like the pregnancy, the name that has become a household word, Oprah, was also an accident. Much is made of the fact that Oprah spent her early years with her grandmother, yet she is only one of a number of famous people who had the same experience, among them former President Bill Clinton, Tipper Gore, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Different sto-ries are told about the reasons for Oprah\u2019s move. In remembering details from her childhood, Oprah has half humorously and half seriously referred to the use of the Sears catalogue in the outhouse. An incident did occur one night when Oprah was about four years old. Al-though the neighbor was old and blind, Oprah remembers him as a res-cuer. 34 OPRAH WINFREY Much like life on the farm, her grandmother was rigid and harsh, meting out punishment for any infringement of rules, even for happen-ings over which the girl had little or no control.\u201d  In recalling her early years, Oprah has re\ufb02  ected that, at various times, she spoke at all the churches in Nashville.  On the Lee farm, Oprah was lonely, isolated, and friendless. Oprah envied children who had easier lives, particularly white children, whose families owned television sets and washing machines; children who had store-bought clothing and who could go to movies; and children who were not punished for every little misdeed, knowing or unknowing. Yet, despite the fact that some writers have called Oprah\u2019s life one of extreme or grinding poverty, because her grandmother owned a farm, she was able to feed and clothe her family, and they never went hungry. (One of Oprah\u2019s relatives claims that Oprah had exaggerated the matter. As a result, Oprah\u2019s sole companions were the pigs she helped take care of. Away from the little house, she could read, talk, and tell stories to them; her restrictive grandmother and her friends believed that Oprah talked too much. Only in adulthood did she recognize 36 OPRAH WINFREYhow fortunate she had been to live with her grandmother for the \ufb01  rst six years of her life; only then could she sort out the love that existed beneath her fear. It took maturity for Oprah to understand that her grandmother had shaped her character, that it was Grandmother Lee who taught her to be strong, to be spiritual, a believer in God.  Oprah has said she expects to be spiritual in the ways her grand-mother was, to be someone who \ufb01  ts into the amen corner. Oprah\u2019s mother, Vernita, seems to have lacked the qualities of her own mother that Oprah admires and cherishes.  Vernita had no room in her apartment for another person, so six-year-old Oprah had to sleep in the foyer. While Oprah lived on the Mississippi farm, a second illegitimate daughter had been born to Vernita, who also had a third illegitimate child when Oprah was about nine years old. In Verni-ta\u2019s household, Oprah felt unloved and unwanted, a burden and an out-cast, inferior to a half-sister she thought prettier because her skin was lighter.\u201d In the same interview, Vernita Lee\u2019s memories of herself when Oprah lived with her bear no resemblance to those of Oprah, nor of the writers who have interviewed the family.\u201d Today, she saves copies of  O  magazine because she thinks they might someday be important, but she also has been annoyed by people who would refer to her as Oprah\u2019s mother. 2   From an early age, like many African Americans, Oprah has been conscious of color\u2014not only in terms of race but of what differences in color mean in people\u2019s lives. Oprah\u2019s longings were neither unique nor limited to blacks. 3  The same is true of Oprah, who believes today that all things are possible.  As Oprah grew up, her color awareness was not limited to observa-tions about whites. Never one to accept the idea of black power\u2014particularly the uncompromising form practiced in the 1970s, when militancy was common\u2014she felt out of 38 OPRAH WINFREYplace in an atmosphere that was frequently hostile. As a dark-skinned African Amer-ican who had some experience of prejudice once she left Mississippi, Oprah has been outspoken on many occasions in her views of racial snobbery that exists even among blacks.  When she got into college, Oprah felt cynical, if not bitter, about the kinds of color discrimination practiced not only on the outside but also within the black community. However, during Oprah\u2019s girlhood in Milwaukee and Nashville, she learned of color issues she\u2019d not confronted before.  Oprah\u2019s undeniable interest in black history in the last two decades has taken many forms in books, movies, and artifacts. Oprah\u2019s read-ing and acting interests meshed when Quincy Jones asked her in 1985 to take the role of So\ufb01  a in a movie about African Americans, Alice Walker\u2019s  The Color Purple,  which became a controversial but \ufb01  nancial and popular success. That would change within a few years with  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 39Oprah\u2019s fame and wealth and the opportunities they brought.\u201d In effect, says Carliss, that woman is Oprah. However, despite Oprah\u2019s dedi-cation to the story; her acting, money, and publicity; and famed director Jonathan Demme, it was a signi\ufb01  cant failure at the box of\ufb01  ce and was rejected by black audiences and critics, who found it too long and com-plex. Even with the outpouring of praise for Oprah\u2019s performance and Disney\u2019s enormous efforts to market the picture, nothing could save it. The 40 OPRAH WINFREY\ufb01 nancial return of approximately $22. The loss was more than monetary to a disheartened Oprah, who had a tremendous emotional commitment to the work and its author.  Because of the interest that had been stirred by  The Color Purple,   Oprah had high expectations for her later \ufb01  lms, several of which pre-ceded  Beloved.\u201d Despite the \ufb02  op, the acting bug never left Oprah, and she has continued to perform in and \ufb01 nance movies for television and theater, and she has experienced both success and failure. His hostile column depicted Oprah as  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 41the \u201cI used cocaine but the man made me do it\u201d host on her program fea-turing a group of women stars from the movie, and in bristling language speaks of her and her guests as \u201ccackl[ing] about how black men do black women wrong in relationships.\u201d 7   Nothing was controversial in  Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,  a movie about Oprah\u2019s dear friend, another \ufb01  lm she produced in 1997. Like his friend Oprah, Jones is someone who uses his celebrity to help children. Before Oprah began a search for her roots with Henry Louis Gates, friend to both Oprah and Jones, Jones led the way. (Similar criticism has been leveled about the choices for her 42 OPRAH WINFREYhighly successful book club. Apparently, West felt a kinship to Oprah, because she had her number on speed dial and didn\u2019t hesitate to use it, as she did one day to complain to Oprah that someone had parked illegally in front of her house. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know what Oprah\u2019s response was. Like many of Oprah\u2019s choices of more recent novels, it focuses on a woman who rebels against societal rules to live the life she chooses. Once again, Oprah selected Halle Berry to play the lead.  Oprah\u2019s most popular television movie, also under the label Oprah Winfrey Presents, was made in 1999 from Mitch Albom\u2019s phenomenally  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 43successful book  Tuesdays with Morrie. The leading television critic for the  Washington Post,  Tom Shales, who doesn\u2019t offer praise lightly, describes Oprah as someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t mess around .  Oprah\u2019s absorption in the historic life of slaves has led her, like a number of other famous and well-to-do African Americans, such as writer and professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Her purchases of bills of sale from the days of slave auctions made the news about the time that Oprah\u2019s production failure of  Beloved  was reported. Clearly, Oprah has not been the \ufb01  rst person to discuss the favored treatment of light- and lighter-skinned Americans.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s interest in the life of slaves and her search for her own roots in the writings from the troubled era of earlier centuries have become part of her persona. Secretary of state in the Bush administration, Con-doleezza Rice, wrote a brief essay about Oprah for  Time  magazine in 2007 44 OPRAH WINFREYin which she identi\ufb01  es Oprah\u2019s life as the story of America: the South-ern girl who lived in poverty, whose childhood years were spent in a home that had neither electricity nor running water; a girl who later used her education, her work, and her fortune to better the lives of many people in her own country and abroad.  Oprah, in matters of family, color, and other issues, came to under-stand and forgive much that embittered her in earlier years. Time helped to distance her from bitterness toward Vernita, whom she saw as an angry, hostile parent, a woman with no love to spare for Oprah.  Oprah\u2019s success as an entertainer and her generosity years later im-proved Vernita\u2019s life. Oprah\u2019s father, by far the better parent, asked for almost nothing. It took several years for Oprah to forgive her. After failed attempts to get Jeffrey, her brother, to change his life and take responsibility for his actions, Oprah refused to help him \ufb01  nancially\u2014although without his knowing it, she provided extra money for him through Vernita.  Some of Oprah\u2019s anger toward family members after she\u2019d achieved fame and fortune resulted from the expectations of relatives and their friends that she would help them monetarily, combined with the fact that they, like her sister and brother, did nothing to help themselves. One relative, how-ever, praises her aunt Oprah for setting an example.  The woman, a niece of Oprah\u2019s who lives in Milwaukee, was inter-viewed by a reporter about the business she and her husband run and the volunteer work they do for the program Discovering Our Destiny. In talking about herself and her famous aunt, Alisha Hayes tells a story of earlier years when she\u2019d asked Oprah for a new car; after her aunt refused, the young woman accepted the idea that she would have to provide it for herself. Oprah has repeatedly stressed the impor-tance of self-help and responsibility, and, although she has said little about her siblings\u2019 lack of initiative for changing their lives, she has little pity for such weakness. Oprah has been generous to her nieces in many ways.  Some biographers have claimed that Oprah holds back nothing about her life, but writer Barbara Grizzutti Harrison notes that Oprah does skirt issues having to do with her family. Even though the press re-ports whatever news there is about her parents, Oprah is reticent about their doings. Thus, the living conditions were much worse for Oprah than they had been on Grandmother Lee\u2019s farm. Vernita\u2019s hopes for marriages brought disappointments in her personal life that were and are not uncommon, something Oprah learned to understand but which were beyond her comprehension when she was a child. 46 OPRAH WINFREY Experience in the larger world brought the mature Oprah into con-tact with many poor young black women whose lives resemble Vernita\u2019s. If Oprah had remained with her mother, the direction of her own life might well have been similar to Vernita\u2019s. Oprah\u2019s huge success and wealth opened doors for Vernita that she never could have achieved on her own. Because of Oprah\u2019s fame and fortune, Vernita\u2019s life resembles that of many a rich person. An account in the entertainment section of the Milwaukee  Journal Sentinel  in September 2008 led a story with the heading, \u201cOprah\u2019s mom is accused of being a deadbeat.\u201d After many months of that type of publicity, Oprah settled her mother\u2019s debt. Al-though Oprah continues to support her mother and is concerned about her welfare, their relationship is far from close.  When Oprah was eight and had reached the end of her \ufb01  rst term in the Milwaukee schools, Vernita, who was struggling \ufb01  nancially, sent her to her father and stepmother in Nashville, to an environment com-pletely opposite from the one Oprah had been living in. The grocery store was where Oprah \ufb01  rst had a job, though it was a job she has said she despised. Because Vernon and Zelma had no children of their own, they wanted to raise Oprah themselves. Barbara Winfrey was a 59-year-old retired educator, the oldest child in a family of eight, as well as the \ufb01  rst of the family to graduate from college. Her life story is the kind of achievement that Oprah believes is possible for girls who aim high. She retired on the sixth anniversary of her marriage to Oprah\u2019s father, whom she had met because of his generosity to her students\u2014that is, troubled teens. However, 48 OPRAH WINFREYshe also plans to get involved in some way in furthering education for others. Over the years, Oprah has spoken of how Duncan inspired her so much that for a time she wanted to become a teacher also. In middle age, Oprah achieved that particu-lar ambition, teaching a graduate credit course called The Dynamics of Leadership with her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, at Northwest-ern University\u2019s J. In 2001, an un-dergraduate course about Oprah was offered. Its description in the catalogue refers to its subject matter as \u201cOprah the Tycoon.  The memory of her early teacher always had a favored place in Oprah\u2019s heart. Because of Duncan, Oprah has said that she believes strongly in the in\ufb02  uence of teachers on the lives of children. No doubt, people like Duncan were an unconscious part of Oprah\u2019s decision in later years to play an active role in providing schools for poor but clever girls. Nevertheless, in\ufb02  uenced by strong faith and the moral atmosphere of Vernon Winfrey\u2019s home, Oprah decided she\u2019d become a missionary when she grew up, and she even collected money for the poor of Costa Rica.  All of the future promise of the Winfrey household seemed to dissipate for Oprah when she was nine; in the summer of 1963, Oprah\u2019s mother, expecting to be married and hoping to have a real family life, insisted on her return to Wisconsin. Oprah experienced regression in the overcrowded, unsupervised, undisciplined life she\u2019d led before, only worse.  Although she kept the violations a \u201cbig, looming, dark secret\u201d for more than 12 years, Oprah has said that she always believed that her mother knew about them and had failed to protect her.  Her mother\u2019s refusal to discuss the matter was so traumatic that Oprah never brought it up again with her. Nevertheless, the matter of her abuse became a public confession years later for Oprah on her televi-sion program when a woman, Trudy Chase, who appeared on the show, spoke of the suffering she had experienced as a child as a result of sexual abuse. The identi\ufb01  cation for Oprah was so intense that all her efforts at concealment over the years slipped away in the shared moments of suffering with her guest.  Almost three decades after the abuse \ufb01  rst occurred, when Oprah had become an internationally famous entertainer on television and in \ufb01  lm, she chose to use her celebrity as a means of speaking out against the terrors of child abuse and the secrecy that surrounds it. In 1992, she 50 OPRAH WINFREYintroduced a documentary titled  Scared Silent,  describing her harsh child-hood experiences of rape and molestation by male relatives, among them an uncle, and family friends.\u201d In the picture, Oprah plays a black everywoman. Although the \ufb01 lm speci\ufb01  cally focuses on blacks, when Oprah uses the term  everywoman  to de\ufb01  ne herself, in life, as she presents her talk show and speaks with interviewees, she does not limit her scope to one race or color. The family, in addition to the central \ufb01  gure of the mother, consists of a grandmother played by Oprah\u2019s friend Maya Angelou, an undependable husband/father, and three sons: one already lost to the prison system, one \u201cin the undecided column,\u201d and the youngest, for whom there is still hope. The setting was the Henry Horner public housing project in Chicago, a place that had caught Oprah\u2019s attention for a long period of time as she drove past it on her way to work.  Talking about her experience of \ufb01  lming the project, Oprah said that she gained knowledge and insight into not only people\u2019s needs but also the longings and dreams for their lives that everyone harbors; she came to understand that everyone goes through some basic human circum-stances. Her philosophy of personal responsibility and self-help, as well as her belief in the vital role  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 51of education, is played out in practical ways again and again in all kinds of situations: in talks, interviews, on her television show, and in  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which she started in 2000 with the partnership of the Hearst Corporation, she emphasizes the possibility of change. But Oprah herself asserts that sharing the truth with others is freeing and uplifting. Clever and talented, a good student as well as an ardent reader even then, Oprah was able, with help from a teacher, to change to Nicolet, a newly integrated Milwaukee high school. In their houses, the children would introduce her to their black maids as if all black people should know each other, and they made the same assumption about Oprah\u2019s supposed familiarity with black entertainers. For Oprah, these memories linger. 52 OPRAH WINFREY The year that Oprah attended Nicolet High is also a time that will long be remembered in history. From the period of Oprah\u2019s birth through the decade of the 1960s, upheaval was prevalent.\u201d 12  Throughout the years, many people paid homage to Parks, as did Oprah when she in-cluded the frail, elderly woman as an honored guest at a screening of  Beloved,  held at Marianne Williamson\u2019s Unity Church. Alienated from the South but not from the cause of civil rights, she moved to Chicago, where she founded the \ufb01  rst African American civic group for women and became the \ufb01  rst president of the Negro Fellowship League and chairman of the Equal Rights League  Oprah Winfrey takes the stage to speak during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Martin Luther King, Jr. (AP Photo/Lawrence Jackson) 54 OPRAH WINFREYof Chicago.    Oprah is captivated by the history and powerful heritage left by a few black women. The year Oprah reached the age of six (1962) and moved from Mississippi to Milwaukee was the historic time that another black student, James Meredith, also from Kosciusko (as was Oprah), had to be enrolled by force at the University of Missis-sippi in Oxford.  Of course, Oprah holds no individual knowledge of any of the political events that happened during the early years of her child-hood or half a century before her birth, and she was only a small child when the \ufb01  rst civil rights bills for blacks since Reconstruction in the 19th century were passed. This period of momentous changes occurred during Oprah\u2019s adolescence, and she was more concerned with her familiar world than the political situation around her.  It isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah, who was not even a teenager in the 1960s, had no concern about politics in her home state and elsewhere. For many years, Oprah maintained a neutral stance about politics. Her one and only foray into the political arena has been for the Democrat candidate for president, Barack Obama.  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 55 Oprah\u2019s early home, Mississippi, has a history of electing Democratic governors and Republican senators.  Oprah has attempted to remain neutral about politics on her tele-vision show. Bush to join a group of of\ufb01  cials on a trip to tour Afghanistan schools; Oprah responded that she was too much in-volved with earlier commitments. That unguarded statement provided media with the chance for some Oprah bashing by people who regarded her response as a political snub of the administration.  Throughout her adult years, Oprah\u2019s concern has not been for politi-cal movements but for the rights of all women everywhere, as well as other individuals whose lives she celebrates. Above all else, education alters everything, and Oprah is passionate about that. With heartfelt admiration for Oprah, Jackson has spoken of the enormity of her contribution in transforming the social structure, an observation echoed hyperbolically in a  Vanity Fair  magazine article characterizing her in\ufb02  uence as greater than almost 56 OPRAH WINFREYanyone on the planet except for the Pope.  Jesse Jackson describes Oprah in the same way she depicts her cher-ished friend Quincy Jones\u2014as a person who lights up the dark places. Oprah\u2019s style of participation in the lives of the underprivileged and Af-rican Americans, however, in the main does not resemble Jackson\u2019s. While Oprah\u2019s bene\ufb01  cence may be directed primarily toward blacks, it isn\u2019t closed to others.  Oprah\u2019s belief in individual accountability is much more pronounced in her advocacy for broader, societal changes, though the exceptions are her calls for stricter gun laws, punishment for those who commit sex crimes against children, and the need for education. In fact, when she is asked about her plans for the time after she leaves her show, she mentions, among other activities, her wish to become more involved with education in Africa, something she has been doing in recent years. At 14, Oprah\u2019s personal problems caught up with her.  Oprah kept secret from her mother the frequent, ongoing attacks by men who came and went in their home. Finally, Vernon agreed to take Oprah back to live with him and Zelma. Today she recognizes him as an honor-able man, the person who saved her life\u2014that is, the one who saw to it 58 OPRAH WINFREYthat she became more than an unwed mother. Oprah recalls his strength as he considered the choices that existed in her situation and then reached the decision to allow her to have the baby. What the 14-year-old Oprah\u2019s feelings were at the time may not be precisely what the middle-aged woman describes as an \u201copportunity\u201d rather than a loss; the opportunity was a choice for her future. Freed of the oppressions of life in Vernita\u2019s home and of teenage motherhood, Oprah began to show signs of promise, although surely nobody in those days could have predicted her later accomplish-ments. Zelma, his wife, also required Oprah to do all the things necessary to become an outstanding student.  Surprisingly, reports that Vernon was writing a \u201cshocking\u201d book about Oprah\u2019s childhood, in which he described her as \u201cdisobedient\u201d and \u201cout of hand,\u201d seem completely at odds with Oprah\u2019s recollections, but it is likely that the sources of the stories probably con\ufb02  ated her earlier years at home with Vernita.  When she was about 15, Oprah began to keep a journal, and she has continued to write in it ever since then. In 1971, during the Nixon administration, when two students from each state and from foreign countries were chosen to attend a White House Conference on Youth, Oprah was one of Tennessee\u2019s representatives. Oprah was recommended by John Heidelberg, who, all these years later, still recalls how much he was impressed by both her articulateness and ease before a camera. Other contestants had given expected, typical answers, so Oprah won, becoming the \ufb01  rst black girl to be named Miss Fire Preven-tion. The interview she\u2019d had during her senior year in high school after she 60 OPRAH WINFREYwas chosen as Miss Fire Prevention led to a job reading the news on ra-dio station WVOL. The station, and particularly John Heidelberg, re-membered Oprah\u2019s outgoing personality from that interview; just for fun, she had read some news copy while she was at the station. She had made a favorable impression with her voice and poise, and when the station needed someone to read the news, they offered the job to Oprah. Oprah has never shown any regrets, surely not publicly, about accepting opportunities of that sort.  Oprah\u2019s world was expanding, not only with a job but also through opportunities to do some acting in college and sing with Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all-women\u2019s a capella group in Nashville. Although some books state that Oprah graduated from college in 1976, the fact is that she did not, and the sit-uation is cloudy. Furthermore, Princeton University in 2002 awarded an hon-orary doctorate of \ufb01  ne arts to Oprah. Since that time, Oprah has received many more honorary degrees.     Not long after, another recognition came to Oprah when she received the sixth Marian Anderson Award. Although most people would probably agree that Oprah \ufb01  ts in that category, there are some who question the choice. An unidenti\ufb01  ed writer in  Philebrity: Philly Media, Gossip, Nightlife & Poli-tics  puts her in a group of \u201cthose who have arguably done more harm than good, culturally speaking:  Oprah Winfrey,  anyone.\u201d (emphasis in 62 OPRAH WINFREYoriginal). a Living God to all who serve in Oprah\u2019s Kingdom of Lowered Expectations.\u201d)  As much as Oprah is a target for all kinds of criticism (much of it humorous and even when she is using her celebrity for admirable causes), she is also, of course, the subject of much adulation. When Philadelphia Mayor John Street, in speaking of the 2003 choice of Oprah for the Mar-ian Anderson Award, took note of Oprah\u2019s work in many social pro-grams as well as her generosity to schools at home and in South Africa,  Oprah Winfrey cheers with the crowd at the commencement ceremony for Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, DC, on May 12, 2007. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 63he also pointed to the importance of her television shows that focus on individual self-help. Oprah, said the mayor, serves as \u201ca national men-tor. Several years earlier, Oprah had received the Horatio Alger Award from the association that annually honors those who have triumphed over adversity with their considerable achievements. Almost everyone who mentions Oprah speaks with awe of her astonishing rise from annihilat-ing poverty to her place on the world\u2019s stage.  Many experiences in Oprah\u2019s younger years were similar to those of other black women of her age. However, in what was to become typical of the future star, Oprah disregarded the adverse circumstances, becoming one of the winners in the contest with her reading of a passage from Ntozake Shange\u2019s  For Colored Girls Who Have Contemplated Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,  a play as-signed in many English classes throughout the country. Decades earlier, when Oprah left Nashville to try her wings elsewhere, she was 22, young and unsophisticated in various ways, only at the beginning of the road that would eventually take her to stardom. Starting out, she didn\u2019t do well in her new job as the anchor of the six o\u2019clock evening news on Baltimore\u2019s station, WJZ-TV , the largest station in the 64 OPRAH WINFREYcity. It became apparent very quickly that Oprah wasn\u2019t meant to be a newswoman. She was demoted from her evening anchor position, but a new station manager who liked Oprah\u2019s style found a slot for her with co-host Richard Sher on a morning program called  People Are Talking.   Even though the show was quite popular, Oprah didn\u2019t particularly like working with another host. With the help of a resume expert and an ambitious producer friend, in 1984, at the age of 30, Oprah relocated to Chicago, a city that has the third largest tele-vision market in the country and which she has referred to as a \u201cmore polished New York.  Only two years after her move to Chicago, her show was syndicated, and, in a sense, a star was born\u2014the star of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   When the show went national in 1986, 32-year-old Oprah celebrated Thanksgiving with Vernon and Zelma Winfrey; the three of them took a triumphal trip back to Mississippi, where they revisited family and friends and old haunts from Oprah\u2019s childhood. In Kosciusko, Oprah\u2019s celebrity is as great as\u2014or perhaps greater than\u2014it is in other parts of the country.  The year following that vacation, in 1987, Oprah received an Emmy Award for daytime television, the \ufb01  rst of more than 30 that would fol-low over the years.  Renaming the program  The Oprah Winfrey Show  was the act of the King Brothers Corporation, a company owned by two well-known dis-tributors who had purchased the show in September 1986. Although most of their clients were very successful game shows, Oprah was the star in their crown, with a show that brought in many millions for the Kings as well as for Oprah. He predicted 66 OPRAH WINFREYaccurately that syndication would make Oprah rich. However, Oprah has said that the phenomenal success of the program came about from it being on the air at the same time throughout the country. King World Productions had merged with CBS in 2000, but Oprah owns and controls her show through Harpo. With Roger King\u2019s death, Oprah not only praised his in-\ufb02  uence on the television industry but also paid tribute to his role in her career.  Despite his extraordinary \ufb01  nancial acumen, Roger King was a rather surprising person to have business dealings with Oprah. Yet, without the Kings, Oprah might never have achieved the exposure she has on television nor the vast sums of money she\u2019s earned. Oprah, like the other entertainers with whom the Kings dealt, has been the recipient of some of their largesse. When does someone like Oprah become \u201ca once colored girl\u201d.   As Oprah gained fame and fortune, she developed an interest in the lives of slaves, and with that came her decision to learn about her own African heritage. Oprah, who wanted to trace her own roots, turned to Gates for guidance.  The search for Oprah\u2019s roots revealed information going back to her matrilineal ancestors in Africa, who were of the Kpelle tribe of Liberia, on the west African coast, which also includes Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast. A further search of Oprah\u2019s maternal ancestors revealed that her great-grandmother, Amanda Winters, had been actively involved in education, and Oprah was understandably delighted. Oprah now has the deed to the property.  68 OPRAH WINFREY Not all black scholars\u2014in fact, not all black Americans\u2014are in-terested in pursuing the course set by Gates. Believing that three decades of af\ufb01  rmative action have \u201cled to the creation of a true black middle class\u201d and that it is time to move beyond the past, he lists the professions in which black Americans have risen to the top of the ladder and mentions Oprah, \u201cthe most prominent talk show host.\u201d Objecting to the views of prominent deniers such as Louis Farrakhan, who claims that \u201csuccessful people like Oprah Winfrey .\u201d  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 69 In her youth, Oprah was inspired by several people, and meeting and talking with them helped her to get her \ufb01  rst talk show. When Oprah took on her Chicago program, Phil Donahue was the leader in the talk show business and people spoke of him as the owner of daytime televi-sion. But Oprah toppled him. Despite having learned what to do by watching tapes of his shows (in addition to those of Barbara Walters) and of being grate-ful to him for paving the way, Oprah\u2019s was a different kind of approach. Donahue, who is just as gracious about Oprah as she is about him, praises her ability to connect with her audience, pointing with admiration to the speed with which she gained huge markets: what took him a decade to do she accomplished in a single year, he tells interviewers, compar-ing her ascent to a skyrocket. Where Donahue was intense, Oprah was easy.  Within a few years of her move to Chicago, the illegitimate daugh-ter of Vernita Lee and Vernon Winfrey became a millionaire and, ac-cording to various reports, among the richest entertainers in the world; additionally,  Forbes  magazine listed her as being one of the wealthiest people in the United States and began to tabulate her wealth, which soon exceeded that of producer Steven Spielberg (who had given her the \ufb01  rst of her movie roles) and Bill Cosby, comedian, television actor, and venerated friend of Oprah. Years later, when  Forbes  ranked the 100 richest people in the world, Oprah made the list as the \ufb01  rst black U. Her fortune continues to grow as she expands her undertak-ings, and journalists continue to speak of Oprah\u2019s enormous wealth.  By 1986, Oprah had earned enough money to buy what most Chi-cagoans dream of\u2014a penthouse condominium on the lakefront with a view from the 57th \ufb02  oor of the lake and the city. Gossip columnists write of the 70 OPRAH WINFREY\u201cfabulous of\ufb01  ce amenities\u201d available to people who work for Harpo: a caf\u00e9 and a workout facility known as Club Harpo, which includes a spa\u2014all of which led one reporter to proclaim, \u201cWe wanna work with Oprah. Oprah is known to be careful about schedules, conscious of attending planned meetings, and she has told journalists that her success with employees comes from her consideration for them: no yelling or mistreatment and no talking down to people. After the bath, Oprah, who modestly calls herself \u201ca home-body,\u201d has a huge selection of elegant pajamas\u2014dozens and dozens, she says\u2014from which to choose. When the 13-year-old cocker spaniel, Sophie, died of kidney failure, it was reported that Oprah had a breakdown during the taping of her show after she\u2019d seen a memorial video of the dog. Oprah\u2019s boyfriend, Stedman Graham, had given Solomon to Oprah as a Christmas present in 1994.  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 71 A few months after the death and memorial display of the dogs, a billboard purchased by the Main Line Animal Rescue appeared four blocks from Oprah\u2019s Harpo studio. It read \u201cOPRAH\u2014please do a show on puppy mills; the dogs need you. In December 2008, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals named Oprah as Person of the Year.  In the midst of the devastating \ufb01  re that spread through southern California in November 2008, Oprah, who was not at her newest home in Montecito at that time, said that her \ufb01  rst concern was for her dogs.  Oprah\u2019s love of dogs led to a further purchase and loss. Oprah\u2019s love of dogs seems never ending. Introduced to Oprah\u2019s studio audience as her \u201cnew babies,\u201d they were dressed in crystal pink collars in celebration of Oprah\u2019s birthday.  In addition to her dogs, Oprah keeps thoroughbred horses on her farm. (Rumor has it that Oprah paid for the home with a personal check. Although Oprah is selective about many details of her private life, parts of the California estate were the focus of photos and narratives about her rose garden and teahouse in the August 2008 issue of  O At Home.) To get from one home to another and to other places easily, Oprah bought a jet plane. Every detail about her life makes the news; thus, it is no surprise to see many, many newspapers writing that Oprah was house hunting in the Washington, DC, area in time for the Obama inaugural events. Some printed photos of stunning, multimillion-dollar houses that Oprah sup-posedly looked at. Despite the denials of intent by Oprah\u2019s staff, the story was widely circulated. So too were reports that Oprah was plan-ning a fabulous party after the inauguration. Among 74 OPRAH WINFREYthem, the most concrete was the decision to produce her television show during the celebrations from the Kennedy Center in Washington.  Oprah\u2019s growing wealth permitted her to make an even more im-portant purchase a number of years ago. At the same time she joined the ranks of the most famous broadcasters\u2014Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, Barbara Walters, Ted Koppel, and others\u2014as Broadcaster of the Year, she acquired ownership and control of  The Oprah Winfrey Show  from the Chicago ABC television af\ufb01  liate WLS and formed the company Harpo.  Oprah is the \ufb01  rst black woman to have her own studio and produc-tion company. was estimated by  Fortune  magazine to be worth $575 million, with Oprah as owner of 90 percent of the stock. In recognition of Oprah\u2019s leadership role in U. The company also is responsible for Oprah\u2019s Web site.  Harpo Print includes all the Oprah publications.  However, on March 4, 2009, the station\u2019s name was changed to Oprah Radio. The plans were to feature familiar Oprah picks, such as her close friends Gayle King and poet 76 OPRAH WINFREYMaya Angelou; designer Nate Berkus, who has been featured in Oprah\u2019s magazines and television shows; Dr. Mehmet Oz, the medical advisor who became a favorite on her television show and soon had his own program; Bob Greene, the \ufb01  tness trainer and author of how-to exercise books; sex therapist Laura Berman, a popular and outspoken guest on Oprah\u2019s television show (said to be hosting the program  Better in Bed  ) and author of  The Book of Love ; \ufb01  nancial expert Jean Chatsky; and other guests from multiple \ufb01  elds.  O ,  The Oprah Magazine  was to have a role in the new program on occasion, and spiritual discussions, poetry, and home matters would be among the subjects. The announced goal of the revised program is a familiar one to Oprah watchers, which is to live your best life. Periodically, Oprah\u2019s own clothing is sold at the store, and the money from those sales is donated to Oprah\u2019s charitable causes., along with Discovery Communication had planned to launch the new Oprah Winfrey Network\u2014OWN\u2014in 2009, under a 50\u201350 partnership agreement between OWN and Dis-covery. (Subscription fees from cable and satellite TV providers are ex-pected to rise once Oprah moves over from broadcast networks after 2011.) However, despite all the hoopla about the relationship of Oprah and Discovery Communications, the early agreement hit several snags. Currently, it isn\u2019t known how much of a presence Oprah will have on the programs. She had been named president in 2008 but resigned. Not surprisingly, given all the publicity about the coming venture and Oprah\u2019s star power, the paper trade named Oprah the most powerful woman of 2008 in the world of entertainment.   Oprah\u2019s desire to give back to others something of what had been given to her led to her creation of another kind of network. However, after 12 years, Oprah is closing it as soon as the remaining funds have been spent. Much of what motivates Oprah is her desire to do good and, like the missionary she once dreamed of becoming, to bring a mes-sage of goodness to others. From the beginning, participants in the Angel Network, with another famous 78 OPRAH WINFREYcharitable group, Habitat for Humanity, have provided homes to thou-sands of families and have funded college scholarships that allow needy and meritorious students to seek higher education. When Oprah has a sale of items in her Chicago shop, money from Oprah\u2019s Closet has been do-nated to her Angel network. No matter that it added a new chat program called  Oprah After the Show  with working women in mind, the cable channel was faltering, in part because it was available only to a limited number of people, fewer than half of the homes in the United States. Oprah has now changed the focus of her broadcasting and gone in an-other direction.  Nevertheless, Oprah could be a poster \ufb01  gure for the advertisement \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby. Four decades later, a middle-aged Oprah, remembering those childhood days and longings, talked to the spring 1997 graduating Wellesley College senior class about the journey they would take into the future.  It took Oprah a long time and many lessons to discover we can only be ourselves, not somebody else, no matter how admirable that some-body might be. Living that way, Oprah main-tains, is central to one\u2019s survival.  Several years later, Oprah agreed to be the speaker at the Duke Uni-versity commencement of her godson, Will Bumpus. Will is the son of Gayle King, Oprah\u2019s closest friend. In an interview, goddaughter Kirby told a student writer for the  Duke Chronicle,  \u201cOprah doesn\u2019t really do commencements\u201d unless she has a special connection to the person who asks her. Obviously, students at Duke bene\ufb01  ted from the Oprah con-nection; the majority at Duke, when the news was announced, appeared to be struck by Winfrey\u2019s star power. That star power was evident as she 80 OPRAH WINFREYreturned to Duke to ful\ufb01  ll her promise; she arrived to cheers and cries of love from the students.  Duke administrators noted their delight in Oprah\u2019s acceptance of the invitation, following it up via e-mail with the notice that Oprah will receive \u201can honorary doctor of humane letters degree\u201d at the ceremony. The degree, as described in the e-mail, is in recognition of Oprah\u2019s use of her celebrity to further education and literacy and other \u201cimportant causes.\u201d Because Oprah usually declines such awards, the vice president for public affairs and government relations (without mentioning Oprah\u2019s \u201cspecial connection\u201d) considers her acceptance as \u201ca testament to [her] great esteem and respect\u201d for Duke.\u201d  An unfortunate incident later marred the impression of Oprah\u2019s rela-tionship with her godchildren, but brie\ufb02  y. Protective as she is of them, she could not keep newspapers from reporting in October 2009 that Kirby played a role in the \ufb01  ring of two members of the staff of Oprah\u2019s private plane.  From the time Oprah realized she\u2019d been given a second chance in life by her father, she has worked unceasingly not only on her career but also to build an image outside the world of entertainment. Among the many important roles she has played, one of the most meaningful took place after the catastrophic events of September 2001, when, as master of ceremonies, Oprah led an interfaith ceremony at Yankee Stadium  A ONCE COLORED GIRL 81in New York. Through talks, music, and writing, Oprah has addressed the speci\ufb01  city of loss and despair as well as other wrenching issues of life, probing the dark places and the light of possibility. 2009.

When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Some programs will be partly original shows, and some will focus on Oprah. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests.  Some media experts are concerned that there will be saturation on the new network because of the dip in Oprah\u2019s ratings that has taken place in the past decade or so. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Hazlett quotes Oprah\u2019s statement about her \u201call-time favorite\u201d cover, the August 2004 issue, which showed her on a beach, where it was chilly enough for the photographer and crew to follow her with heaters \u2014 obviously it wasn\u2019t August for the shooting. Outstanding books also get a nod in the same anniversary issue, with 10 of them \u201cthat rocked Oprah\u2019s decade. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned.  On one of Oprah\u2019s shows featuring gays and sometimes their family members, Berkus was included. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion. Berkus has been signi\ufb01  cant in  O, The Oprah Magazine,   but now that the decision has been made to shift the taping of the daily Oprah television program to New York, the future is cloudy for Chicagoans such as Berkus, even though the announcement was made that Harpo, with its many branches, will remain in the city, and Oprah has opened another shop in Chicago, indicating she is not cutting entirely her con-nection to Chicago.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health. Whether it is his visibility in so many of Oprah\u2019s undertakings or his audacious and sometimes combative daily television show that is the source of the negative assessments, his ar-ticles \ufb01  t into an established pattern of most women\u2019s magazines.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. A num-ber of blogs and various comments also appeared, such as the recom-mendation that the marriage counselor get marriage counseling, and some papers reported Oprah\u2019s displeasure about the stories. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times. Oprah has told him she wants the show to focus on people, and that is what he is doing.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. Oprah coauthored Greene\u2019s first book, and he later became one of the hosts on Oprah Radio XM, which formerly had been  Oprah and Friends.  His show airs on Saturdays, with other Oprah favorites hosting on other days: best friend Gayle King, mentor Maya Angelou, writer Lisa Kogan, sex therapist Dr. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life. Greene\u2019s focus was on \u201cemotional eating,\u201d a subject well known to Oprah, who made it a frequent subject on her show over the years.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue.  Not all cultures obsess in the same way: white South Africa, for in-stance, a country in which racial issues remain a signi\ufb01  cant matter, seems more interested in her weight than in her race, which might be attrib-utable to Oprah\u2019s former preoccupations but also to the popularity of her magazine and programs in that country.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.  Advertising Age  made the point that Oprah\u2019s friend Gayle King (who also is editor-at-large for  O, The Oprah Magazine ) was given Dove\u2019s \ufb01  rst Real Beauty Award.  Oprah\u2019s Harpo Productions attempts to hold tight control on all things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Oprah stopped attending tradi-tional churches and wanted to separate herself from the angry messages of preachers such as Wright. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following.\u201d Oprah, said Crouch, is \u201cthe Mother Courage of talk television .  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth. Nonetheless, some members of the religious right have attacked Oprah\u2019s programs and in\ufb02  uence on her \u201cstudents,\u201d calling her \u201cthe devil.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. He disagrees with Tolle and faults Oprah for \u201cundercutting Christianity.\u201d 9   With all the negative publicity, Oprah became defensive about her choices of Tolle\u2019s books for her classes and the classes themselves, point-edly stating they were not about religion but rather to help people ex-plore their consciousness. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d.  A month after Reverend Wright\u2019s intemperate remarks, Oprah started the Soul Series, on XM radio online. For 10 weeks, Oprah and author Eckhart Tolle taught the material from his book,  A New Earth,  the  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 17761st book featured on Oprah\u2019s Book Club as well as her choice for their summer reading. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

Calling Oprah \u201cthe Jezebel of Prophecy,\u201d a documentary \ufb01  lmmaker advertising his availability for interviews (but not interviewed by Oprah) produced a DVD,  Hebrew or the So-Called Negro,  warning of her destruc-tive effect.\u201d Shown on YouTube, thus guaranteeing a wide audience, it describes Oprah as de-nying major beliefs of Christianity.\u201d Coppenger moves from God\u2019s indignation to his own, faulting Oprah for having her own agenda, which includes the unacceptable \u201ccohabiting with Stedman Graham.\u201d  Some people who are interested in Oprah\u2019s love life report that she and Graham live together, and others claim that the two have separated. A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey.

The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King. Although King shares many, many activities with Oprah and has become a prominent \ufb01  gure on her own in television and radio, as well as in Oprah\u2019s publications, both women scorn the implications of the press, and both have also stated there is no shame in anyone\u2019s being gay.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.   Oprah Winfrey has a hug from poet Maya Angelou during the Uncommon Height Award of the National Council of Negro Women, honoring Oprah Winfrey in Washington, DC, on June 4, 2009. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)182 OPRAH WINFREY Jennie Rothenberg Gritz, writing in  The Atlantic,  thinks men \ufb01  nd Oprah \u201ctroublesome,\u201d because she has the \u201ccapacity to take over the world,\u201d and they object to the ways that women follow Oprah, who has \u201cinvaded their homes\u2014from kitchen to bedroom.\u201d Apparently, or not so apparently, she tells readers, men object to the changes Oprah has wrought in marital relationships. Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. Without Oprah\u2019s golden touch, though, and no interview, the book sales were weak. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish. In reports of a tragic happen-ing in 2005, newspapers referred to the man responsible, James Arthur Ray, as an \u201cOprah approved self-help guru.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. When questioned, though, about Oprah\u2019s refusal to autho-rize the book, Kelley states she was not interested in going that route. But Oprah\u2019s less scandalous involvement in spiritual studies and events during the past few years has brought about more sermons, reports, praise, and condemnation than anything else to date. It re-mains to be seen what the Kelley effect does to Oprah\u2019s image, and if there is damage, how long the aftershocks linger and whether there will be any tie-in to the spiritual part of the star\u2019s life.  For several years, numerous religious \ufb01  gures have attacked every-thing Oprah has said or done about religion and spirituality. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy.\u201d They do not accuse Oprah of being anti-Christian but anti-Bible. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.\u201d The authors\u2019 intention is to show that Oprah\u2019s spirituality doesn\u2019t \ufb01  t their evangelical beliefs.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. Michael Beckwith, founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center in Cul-ver City, California, and author of the book  Spiritual Liberation  (2009), appeared on the Oprah program in 2009. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. But Oprah, in contrast, he claims, \u201cmocks\u201d such views in favor of \u201cself-adoration. descended from Adam and Eve,\u201d and Oprah, as evolving \u201cby chance .\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.\u201d 12   If such harsh condemnation isn\u2019t suf\ufb01  cient to turn admirers away from Oprah, it is not for lack of critics. A Web site named Jesus-is-Savior speaks of Oprah as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in the world,\u201d and the author of a self-published book,  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid  (a title that refers to the tragic deaths in 1978 of hundreds of people who had belonged to a cult) warns readers of the \u201cspell . [that] is over Oprah,\u201d suggesting they too will die because of her teachings. If the reader won-ders what it is that Oprah has unleashed upon the world, her critics \ufb01  nd endless examples. The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d When  Newsweek  published a lengthy ar-ticle berating her in\ufb02  uence on the public, 14  several physicians wrote letters of support for that view, one saying she supports bad medicine in her role, creating the \u201cOprah-\ufb01  cation of medicine.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration. (Was one or more of the critics thinking of Chauncey in referring to a report that \u201ceven Oprah\u201d [often.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 189 Although it was Oprah who made Tolle famous, one might question the idea that she alone is entirely responsible for his overwhelming success. 16   At times it seems that Oprah does nothing but work, travel for busi-ness, give talks, appear on shows other than her own, and on and on. Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign. This was a \ufb01  rst for Oprah, who had attempted to be impartial in previous campaigns. When interviewed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Oprah\u2019s closest friend, Gayle King, stated that she and Oprah think of politics differently. Oprah generally has little interest in politics, but Gayle is completely immersed in everything political and describes herself as someone who \u201ceat[s], sleep[s] and breathe[s] politics.\u201d For Oprah, Obama made the difference. By endorsing her longtime friend, Oprah thought her personal participation was more valuable than money; Obama\u2019s popularity went up, but her involvement affected her own ratings adversely.  From the time she \ufb01  rst announced her political partisanship, there was a steady drop in the numbers of people who would be likely to vote for an Oprah choice. Some reporters claimed that white women were angry at Obama but not at Oprah; it also has been attributed to women who had great hopes to see a woman (Hillary Clinton) elected. One headline captured this sentiment with \u201cOprah\u2019s talk show crown slipping.\u201d Another, an eye-catching headline on May 29, 2008, in the tabloid  Star Magazine  questioned: \u201cHas Oprah passed her expiration date.\u201d Comedian Roseanne Barr went further in her blog than most liberals in her attack on Oprah (as well as aiming a verbal barrage at a number of other well-known Democrats, whom she accused of wanting to lose the election by nominating Barack Obama). Her most hostile, and somewhat hysterical, language, however, was directed at Oprah. Barr stated, Oprah \u201calways gets her republican friends elected.\u201d Ad-ditionally, Barr wrote that Oprah succeeded in splitting the women\u2019s vote and destabilizing the entire Democratic Party. 3  Yet only a few years earlier, Roseanne had lavished praise on Oprah.  The friendliest advice Oprah might have followed was given by a  Los Angeles Times  writer after Obama failed to gain more votes than Hillary Clinton in Indiana: \u201cHer [Oprah\u2019s] estimated fortune of Democratic presidential hopeful, Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., his wife Michelle, right, and Oprah Winfrey wave to the crowd at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Rich quoted a laudatory description of Oprah from Billy Graham\u2019s evangelical journal,  Christianity T oday:  She is \u201can icon of church-free spirituality,\u201d and her beliefs \u201ccannot simply be dismissed as super\ufb01  cial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime.\u201d  Multiple reports that previously were doubtful or negative about Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence in the campaign soon reversed, \ufb01  nding that she had given a huge boost to Obama; famed longtime reporter, David Broder, writing during the campaign in Iowa, told of the enormous crowds never before seen in the history of Iowa caucuses. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. Many newspapers, including some in Europe, made much of a publi-cist\u2019s spokesperson\u2019s announcement that Oprah would be in Denver\u2019s Invesco Field football stadium for the nomination of Barack Obama; they also quoted Gayle King\u2019s statements that Oprah would not address the crowds. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah.   The  Chicago Sun-Times  has an Oprah-dedicated blogger, Mark Bieganski, who calls his blog \u201cIt\u2019s all about Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. As  New York Times  writer Alexandra Stanley has said of Oprah, she has \u201cnever concealed her messianic sense of purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice.  In earlier years, when she was not yet the phenomenon she has become, the press\u2014particularly the tabloid press\u2014\ufb01  xated on her 14 OPRAH WINFREYimperfections, watching her every move and photo, even to the extent of making personal and cruel remarks, such as comparisons of Oprah to famous overweight entertainers of the past: the hefty late singer Sophie Tucker and the late, overly large black actress Hattie McDaniel, who played the simpering maid to Vivian Leigh\u2019s Scarlet O\u2019Hara in the \ufb01 lm  Gone with the Wind. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. Oprah served in that capacity following the national disaster of September 11, 2001. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input.\u201d Vernon Winfrey\u2019s book will not appear. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press. One that has covered a larger territory and has been reviewed more widely is Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah: Cultural Icon for the Neoliberal Press.\u201d In a lengthy \u201cBlack Agenda Radio Interview\u201d hosted by Brace Dixon, Peck agrees that she regards Oprah\u2019s message as politi-cal, a politics \u201cthat puts the personal responsibility for being poor and oppressed exclusively on the poor and oppressed.  Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr. Kathleen Rooney, \u201cThe Five Myths about Oprah, Obama,\u201d  Wash-ington Post,  14 Sept.", "Oprah_Winfreyin_2008": " Undoubtedly, someday not far into the future, there will be girls named Oprah. A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign. This was a \ufb01  rst for Oprah, who had attempted to be impartial in previous campaigns. When interviewed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Oprah\u2019s closest friend, Gayle King, stated that she and Oprah think of politics differently. Oprah generally has little interest in politics, but Gayle is completely immersed in everything political and describes herself as someone who \u201ceat[s], sleep[s] and breathe[s] politics.\u201d For Oprah, Obama made the difference. By endorsing her longtime friend, Oprah thought her personal participation was more valuable than money; Obama\u2019s popularity went up, but her involvement affected her own ratings adversely.  From the time she \ufb01  rst announced her political partisanship, there was a steady drop in the numbers of people who would be likely to vote for an Oprah choice. Some reporters claimed that white women were angry at Obama but not at Oprah; it also has been attributed to women who had great hopes to see a woman (Hillary Clinton) elected. One headline captured this sentiment with \u201cOprah\u2019s talk show crown slipping.\u201d Another, an eye-catching headline on May 29, 2008, in the tabloid  Star Magazine  questioned: \u201cHas Oprah passed her expiration date.\u201d Comedian Roseanne Barr went further in her blog than most liberals in her attack on Oprah (as well as aiming a verbal barrage at a number of other well-known Democrats, whom she accused of wanting to lose the election by nominating Barack Obama). Her most hostile, and somewhat hysterical, language, however, was directed at Oprah. Barr stated, Oprah \u201calways gets her republican friends elected.\u201d Ad-ditionally, Barr wrote that Oprah succeeded in splitting the women\u2019s vote and destabilizing the entire Democratic Party. 3  Yet only a few years earlier, Roseanne had lavished praise on Oprah.  The friendliest advice Oprah might have followed was given by a  Los Angeles Times  writer after Obama failed to gain more votes than Hillary Clinton in Indiana: \u201cHer [Oprah\u2019s] estimated fortune of Democratic presidential hopeful, Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., his wife Michelle, right, and Oprah Winfrey wave to the crowd at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Although Rich agrees that Oprah is a \u201cmegaceleb-rity,\u201d he pointed out that \u201cselling presidents is not the same as pushing  Anna Karenina.\u201d Rich quoted a laudatory description of Oprah from Billy Graham\u2019s evangelical journal,  Christianity T oday:  She is \u201can icon of church-free spirituality,\u201d and her beliefs \u201ccannot simply be dismissed as super\ufb01  cial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble.\u201d In contrast, a group of evangelical Christians, labeling Oprah \u201cthe queen of the new age gurus,\u201d places her among those \u201cwho are sucking millions of people into false doctrines.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs. Where Pilkington frowns upon Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence as a false guru, Farr labels her \u201cthe perfect guru for [our] democratic age,\u201d one who insists we each have our own power and control in making choices.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Yet, regardless of the polls about Oprah\u2019s television rat-ings, it seems her support of Obama provided an important in\ufb02  uence on more than a million voters. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. They found that more than a million people cast votes for Obama in the prima-ries as a result of Oprah\u2019s endorsement, which Johnson labeled \u201cOprah Winfrey\u2019s million-voter march\u201d (a play on the name of an event of sev-eral years earlier. In that same Labor Day issue of the  Post , in \u201cThe Reliable Source\u201d (in the Style section), the report-ers noted that ticket lines for the Winfrey program featuring medalists from the 2008 Olympics began to form at 6:00  a. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime.\u201d  Multiple reports that previously were doubtful or negative about Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence in the campaign soon reversed, \ufb01  nding that she had given a huge boost to Obama; famed longtime reporter, David Broder, writing during the campaign in Iowa, told of the enormous crowds never before seen in the history of Iowa caucuses. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. Many newspapers, including some in Europe, made much of a publi-cist\u2019s spokesperson\u2019s announcement that Oprah would be in Denver\u2019s Invesco Field football stadium for the nomination of Barack Obama; they also quoted Gayle King\u2019s statements that Oprah would not address the crowds. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah.   The  Chicago Sun-Times  has an Oprah-dedicated blogger, Mark Bieganski, who calls his blog \u201cIt\u2019s all about Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. As  New York Times  writer Alexandra Stanley has said of Oprah, she has \u201cnever concealed her messianic sense of purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Of all the areas that Oprah has been involved in, selling real estate isn\u2019t one. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. Oprah served in that capacity following the national disaster of September 11, 2001. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input.\u201d Vernon Winfrey\u2019s book will not appear. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press. One that has covered a larger territory and has been reviewed more widely is Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah: Cultural Icon for the Neoliberal Press.\u201d In a lengthy \u201cBlack Agenda Radio Interview\u201d hosted by Brace Dixon, Peck agrees that she regards Oprah\u2019s message as politi-cal, a politics \u201cthat puts the personal responsibility for being poor and oppressed exclusively on the poor and oppressed. society has not transcended race, that we cover up and avoid many issues, which is what Oprah has done, with the result that her \u201cmajority white following\u201d remains com-fortable with her.  Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. However, rumors persisted that Oprah would not renew her contract with CBS after 2011, once she bought into the new network, OWN. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr.

A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Although Rich agrees that Oprah is a \u201cmegaceleb-rity,\u201d he pointed out that \u201cselling presidents is not the same as pushing  Anna Karenina.\u201d Rich quoted a laudatory description of Oprah from Billy Graham\u2019s evangelical journal,  Christianity T oday:  She is \u201can icon of church-free spirituality,\u201d and her beliefs \u201ccannot simply be dismissed as super\ufb01  cial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. In that same Labor Day issue of the  Post , in \u201cThe Reliable Source\u201d (in the Style section), the report-ers noted that ticket lines for the Winfrey program featuring medalists from the 2008 Olympics began to form at 6:00  a. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime.\u201d  Multiple reports that previously were doubtful or negative about Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence in the campaign soon reversed, \ufb01  nding that she had given a huge boost to Obama; famed longtime reporter, David Broder, writing during the campaign in Iowa, told of the enormous crowds never before seen in the history of Iowa caucuses. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. A nontelevised affair took place when Oprah hosted a party at the White House the night of the inauguration. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  An \u201caha\u201d moment, the kind she writes about monthly in  O, The Oprah Magazine,  came to Oprah not only through such experiences as her trip to Israel. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Of all the areas that Oprah has been involved in, selling real estate isn\u2019t one. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. Oprah served in that capacity following the national disaster of September 11, 2001. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input.\u201d Vernon Winfrey\u2019s book will not appear. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press. One that has covered a larger territory and has been reviewed more widely is Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah: Cultural Icon for the Neoliberal Press.\u201d In a lengthy \u201cBlack Agenda Radio Interview\u201d hosted by Brace Dixon, Peck agrees that she regards Oprah\u2019s message as politi-cal, a politics \u201cthat puts the personal responsibility for being poor and oppressed exclusively on the poor and oppressed.  Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. However, rumors persisted that Oprah would not renew her contract with CBS after 2011, once she bought into the new network, OWN. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr.

A few years ago, actress Meg Ryan thought of naming her baby girl Oprah Winfrey Ryan. How-ever, as of now, the world seems to know of only one Oprah. 1   Simple references to Oprah do not have to be explained. Talk shows are public favor-ites, and in the Harris poll for \ufb01  ve years in a row, Oprah was chosen as the public\u2019s favorite television star. In another poll, some admirers picked former Senator 2 OPRAH WINFREYHillary Clinton as their favorite woman, but a Fox News Opinion poll showed Oprah to be more powerful than Clinton.  Another type of poll taken in 2008 at Sacred Heart University found one reason for Oprah\u2019s decline in popularity: more than half of the respondents objected to celebrities\u2019 involvement with public policy. Because of Oprah\u2019s huge following, many polls tracked the ef-fect of her involvement in the presidential race of 2008, and speci\ufb01  -cally her support of the Obama campaign. This was a \ufb01  rst for Oprah, who had attempted to be impartial in previous campaigns. When interviewed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Oprah\u2019s closest friend, Gayle King, stated that she and Oprah think of politics differently. Oprah generally has little interest in politics, but Gayle is completely immersed in everything political and describes herself as someone who \u201ceat[s], sleep[s] and breathe[s] politics.\u201d For Oprah, Obama made the difference. By endorsing her longtime friend, Oprah thought her personal participation was more valuable than money; Obama\u2019s popularity went up, but her involvement affected her own ratings adversely.  From the time she \ufb01  rst announced her political partisanship, there was a steady drop in the numbers of people who would be likely to vote for an Oprah choice. Some reporters claimed that white women were angry at Obama but not at Oprah; it also has been attributed to women who had great hopes to see a woman (Hillary Clinton) elected. One headline captured this sentiment with \u201cOprah\u2019s talk show crown slipping.\u201d Another, an eye-catching headline on May 29, 2008, in the tabloid  Star Magazine  questioned: \u201cHas Oprah passed her expiration date. Barr stated, Oprah \u201calways gets her republican friends elected.\u201d Ad-ditionally, Barr wrote that Oprah succeeded in splitting the women\u2019s vote and destabilizing the entire Democratic Party. 3  Yet only a few years earlier, Roseanne had lavished praise on Oprah.  The friendliest advice Oprah might have followed was given by a  Los Angeles Times  writer after Obama failed to gain more votes than Hillary Clinton in Indiana: \u201cHer [Oprah\u2019s] estimated fortune of Democratic presidential hopeful, Senator Barack Obama, D-Ill., his wife Michelle, right, and Oprah Winfrey wave to the crowd at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)4 OPRAH WINFREYbillions might have enabled her to purchase an entire state, such as Indiana.  Earlier,  Time  magazine, in its May 2008 issue, listed Oprah as one of its 100 most signi\ufb01  cant people of the year, with Michelle Obama as the author of the accompanying piece. Like other brief biographies of people chosen for the issue, this one is \ufb01  lled with praise for Oprah and her accomplishments. T wo of the editors of the magazine, when questioned about their reasons for picking Oprah, noted her important in\ufb02  uence on U. A line that appears periodically in tabloids suggests that the two women, Michelle Obama and Oprah, don\u2019t like each other, and some hint at antipathy on Oprah\u2019s part. Obama was angry at Oprah\u2019s assumption that she could enter the White House at will and that she does not believe Oprah had any signi\ufb01  cant role in Obama\u2019s election.com has listed on its Web site re-puted leaks from various sources that Michelle Obama and Oprah have become very close (although some tabloids keep repeating that they don\u2019t like each other), and Gayle King is said to be the person having problems with Mrs. Obama. Oprah makes her own decisions about friendships and allegiances. King has become more and more visible in Oprah\u2019s world, and the differences between them seem the product of a publicist\u2019s activities.\u201d Although Rich agrees that Oprah is a \u201cmegaceleb-rity,\u201d he pointed out that \u201cselling presidents is not the same as pushing  Anna Karenina.\u201d In contrast, a group of evangelical Christians, labeling Oprah \u201cthe queen of the new age gurus,\u201d places her among those \u201cwho are sucking millions of people into false doctrines.\u201d 5   Rich also derided some pundits\u2019 uncomplimentary views of people who might have been inclined to vote for Oprah\u2019s choice.\u201d On the contrary, he pointed out, Oprah\u2019s television audience is as many as 80 percent white, blue-collar people; half are estimated to have yearly incomes under $40,000, and they are mostly women aged 50 or older.  Rich is only one of many journalists who have written about the Oprah\u2013Obama connection. An article titled \u201cOprah Slips in the Polls,\u201d by Anthony Randazzo for  World  on the Web, stated, \u201cOprah is stand-ing for change with Obama, but thus far the biggest change she\u2019s seen is in her approval ratings. Gender might be a factor 6 OPRAH WINFREYin such decisions; some, voicing the feelings of many women, criticized Oprah for failing to stand up for women, particularly for overlooking Hillary Clinton, the wife of the man whom Oprah\u2019s closest friends have called \u201cthe \ufb01  rst black president.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s form of politics re\ufb02  ects her beliefs. Where Pilkington frowns upon Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence as a false guru, Farr labels her \u201cthe perfect guru for [our] democratic age,\u201d one who insists we each have our own power and control in making choices.  Few journalists have actually analyzed the reason or reasons for Oprah\u2019s declining popularity, a fall that may be only temporary given the fact that almost everything she touches seems to succeed. All of this analysis, however, may have played a signi\ufb01  cant role in Oprah\u2019s decision to make major changes in her career.  People supposedly in the know\u2014the pundits who state that celeb-rities don\u2019t in\ufb02  uence votes\u2014seem to have underestimated Oprah\u2019s persuasiveness. Ted Johnson, writing in the August 8, 2008, edition of  Variety,  listed several surveys that saw a positive effect of Oprah\u2019s participation, particularly in the study of two graduate stu-dents of economics, Craig Garthwaite and Tim More, at the University of Maryland. The two doctoral candidates did a mathematical study of Oprah\u2019s role, which resulted in a 58-page report. Although the program featuring Olympic win-ners was expected to be a great draw, the reporters speculated that Oprah\u2019s \u201caccomplishments will resonate long after the athletes\u2019 suc-cesses are forgotten.  When Obama gained the nomination, Oprah described herself to  Entertainment Today  as \u201cecstatic,\u201d \u201ceuphoric,\u201d \u201cdoing the happy dance,\u201d and declared she\u2019d cried her eyelashes off. Joining the huge celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park after the election of Senator Obama, Oprah emotionally expressed her joy, calling the outcome of the election \u201cthe right thing\u201d for America, something unexpected \u201cin our lifetime. Other writers said the same and, like Broder, began to call the events \u201cthe Oprah-Obama show. As it turned out, Oprah had several events planned. The somewhat informal program was a recap 8 OPRAH WINFREYof the historical implications of the election.  All of Oprah\u2019s activities continue to interest the world at large. Not a day passes without our seeing or hearing some reference to Oprah, whether it is important or minuscule. None of this coverage is particularly surprising; there are almost daily stories, blogs, and reports about Oprah on the Internet. One blogger even elevated her to the status of \u201cTHE Oprah.\u201d  Harsh attacks against Oprah began once her support for Obama was announced and continued after the Republican convention. During a heated discussion, at one point, Oprah had to remind some people that she was \u201ca free black woman.\u201d  Such stories, reports, and the hundreds of advertisements in all the Oprah publications and shows attest to her in\ufb02  uence on followers. Products touted by Oprah, no matter how limited their previous sales have been, when advertised on the Internet \ufb01  nd a much larger audience than most of Oprah\u2019s own publications. Anything Oprah eats, drinks, or wears reaps much bene\ufb01  t from the Oprah connection. On one of her shows, Oprah fea-tured Susan Nethero, chief \ufb01  t stylist and founder of a group of lingerie shops. Members of Oprah\u2019s staff, and Oprah herself, were \ufb01  tted with bras. At the end of the show, Oprah proclaimed she \ufb01  nally got the right size. Although Oprah and her show \ufb01  red up customers, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commis-sion \ufb01  ned the company $30 million for \u201cperpetuating misconceptions\u201d about the product.)  Whether a business is large or small, the magic of Oprah\u2019s name in-creases revenues. A company called Spotlight Tribute, which features 10 OPRAH WINFREYtrading cards, noted that \u201cthe Oprah Winfrey trading card is an item that Oprah\u2019s fans have made a valued collectible in its group of 72 cards of the World\u2019s Biggest Stars.\u201d  Even though women around the world are enthralled by her pro-gram, men are generally not Oprah watchers. With a headline \u201cPerhaps Oprah\u2019s appeal [is] lost on men,\u201d Kline ex-plains his indifference, calling her \u201ca fairly tepid talk show host\u201d who is \u201cunremarkable\u201d and \u201cunfunny,\u201d a person who \u201chas no special talent as an interviewer\u201d and engages in \u201cunnecessary \ufb01  ts of hysteria.\u201d His re-marks suggest she is grossly overpaid, and so is her closest friend, Gayle King, who has become rich simply from \u201cknowing Oprah.) Oprah\u2019s appeal crosses racial lines, even though the studio audiences for her live television shows in the United States and her nationwide tours are predominantly white.  Obviously, Oprah\u2019s celebrity, in\ufb02  uence, star power, and following do not mesh with the views of all journalists, television critics, and reli-gious \ufb01  gures, whose writings frequently provide ironic or harsh contrast to the \ufb02  attering language of her followers. Ever since the Internet be-came popular and widely available, many people have joined in the conversations about Oprah. But more common, as might be expected, is exuberant praise for the writer\u2019s idol\u2014Oprah. That onslaught occurred when Oprah invited viewers to join an online class discussion of a book,  The New Earth,  she had chosen for her club.  The outpouring of affectionate interest of fans and bloggers in most Oprah activities sharply contrasts with Swampscott reporter Daniel Kline\u2019s harsh evaluation.\u201d Making fun of white women who treat their help like underlings, Oprah \u201cyells\u201d she wishes her grandmother could see her now, with \u201cWHITE FOLKS WORKING FOR ME. Also, most readers are aware that many blogs are unreliable, and this particular one seems at odds with Oprah\u2019s public persona. Nonetheless, it is not all the wars of history against 12 OPRAH WINFREYwhich Oprah has spoken out, and Oprah does not take a paci\ufb01  st\u2019s po-sition on every military action. In a speech during a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Oprah told the audience about her trip with author Elie Wiesel to Auschwitz, the concentration camp. Once her employees had convinced Oprah how important the cause was, she made it her own.  Oprah has long held the conviction that every life has a purpose. Stanley calls Oprah \u201cher own version of a United Nations educational and cultural organization: \u201cO\u201d-nesco. In her 2005  New York Times  article about Oprah\u2019s 20 years as a talk show host, Stanley both criticizes and praises Oprah\u2019s activities. Yet she also writes admiringly of Oprah\u2019s worldwide in\ufb02  uence and embrace of wor-thy causes and help to the needy.  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 13 Oprah\u2019s involvement exists not only in causes but even in small ges-tures. A brief news report tells of an encounter she had with a woman in Chicago who was trying to enter a polling station to vote, but she was not admitted until Oprah came along to help her.\u201d 7  Telling Jeanne Wolf, the interviewer, of her memories of a fourth-grade teacher who always praised her, Oprah recalls the words of that teacher, who told her she \u201cwas just the smartest little girl [the teacher] had ever seen. In saying, \u201cI always try to have a shiny mo-ment,\u201d Oprah means it to be an expression of her basic philosophy, a \u201csharing\u201d that is \u201cself-ful\ufb01  lling\u201d and also provides for others \u201cvalidation and appreciation.\u201d Such small gestures combined with Oprah\u2019s human-itarian work have led some admirers to propose she be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  An \u201caha\u201d moment, the kind she writes about monthly in  O, The Oprah Magazine,  came to Oprah not only through such experiences as her trip to Israel. When she fully understood political power and the force of the media, Oprah decided to expand her activities: to become more involved in education, reach out to more people in need, and help bring about national awareness through a political campaign she could believe in. Although a number of people have maintained that Oprah\u2019s political support, like that of other celebrities, did little to change votes, the media has photographed every sighting of her in every town she appeared with a candidate.  Possibly the composition of future live audiences might change since Oprah became actively involved in politics, drawing huge crowds of black voters wherever she spoke. When Oprah arrives in any town, for any reason, the excitement is palpable, be it for one of her Live Your Best Life tours or for rallying voters for a candidate, where there is hope that the thousands who \ufb01  ll the seats will turn into donors, campaign organizers, and other workers, as well as voters for Oprah\u2019s choice. In fairness to the press, it should be noted that, formerly, Oprah herself made the topic of her weight central. The January 2009 cover of her magazine featured two Oprahs: one exquisitely thin and one matronly, overweight, and unhappy looking.   New York Times  correspondent Ted Pandeva Zagar found Oprah\u2019s weight problems linked to astrology; Oprah\u2019s birth at 4:30  p.\u201d 8  Oprah herself has not blamed the conjunction of the planets for her dif\ufb01  culties. Oprah has become queen of all she surveys, a powerhouse player in every form of media: radio, the Internet, and women\u2019s publi-cations\u2014 O, The Oprah Magazine; O At Home  (now suspended); and  The O Magazine Cookbook. Her plan, describing a real-ity show titled  The Philanthropist,  was rejected by Oprah\u2019s company after some time had passed; yet the focus of the complaint was about the plan Oprah\u2019s company had for a series that was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the concept of  The Philanthropist. The outcome may never be known because of the tight control of information by Oprah\u2019s company. Perhaps Oprah pays more atten-tion to critics than she claims. There appears to be a growing respect in recent years 16 OPRAH WINFREYtoward racial differences. Oprah\u2019s audience does not appear to consider race in its devotion to her. columnists, in contrast, over the years have used language about Oprah that appears patronizing: \u201cOprify,\u201d \u201cOprahization,\u201d \u201cEmpress,\u201d \u201cSaint Oprah,\u201d and the \u201cCzarina of popu-lar culture\u201d in \u201cthe Oprahsphere\u201d that is ruled by the \u201cdaytime queen of empathy.\u201d Perhaps as Oprah has become more involved in signi\ufb01  -cant activities, the critical weather has undergone a change, with more frequent serious statements and fewer \ufb02  ippant articles about her, and when the comments are light, they tend to be more friendly than nega-tive. Along with the growth of Oprah\u2019s empire and in\ufb02  uence, leading journalists in both the news and entertainment industries have devel-oped an affectionate type of deference toward her.\u201d  At times it is as though anything hinting about an Oprah connec-tion will be published. Oprah is news to the extent that Google gathers daily items from all over the world for \u201cOprah Alert,\u201d which is avail-able to Internet users who want to follow everything about the media queen. But the only prominent name noted in the press and the Web site was  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 17 No matter the occasion, in recent years, if Oprah\u2019s name can be brought in, even the most far-fetched subject for a report appears some-where. Perhaps this was the strangest, when in 2007, a real estate poll was conducted about the popularity of Oprah versus that of Donald Trump. More baby boomers and seniors picked Oprah rather than Trump as their preferred real estate agent. Nevertheless, the very use of her name has cachet, regardless of whether the event has any relationship to Oprah. Her name, or even something that sounds like it, will make news: thus, the naming of a now four-year-old horse as Oprah Winney of Sanford Characters stables.  Because of her popularity and fame, Oprah\u2019s career is frequently compared to that of Mary Kay Ash, the late cosmetics entrepreneur whose business empire continues to thrive even after her death. When Mary Kay died in November 2001, the obituary in the  Washington Post  noted her signi\ufb01  cance in revealing to women like Oprah an under-standing of the methods she had used in gaining success; later, the same methods worked for Oprah, most signi\ufb01  cantly involving groups in her company\u2019s business activities.  Few would debate that Oprah has won her stripes the hard way: na-tional and international celebrity have made her someone to be reck-oned with as owner or partner in networks, schools, and businesses.  Forbes,  like O\u2019Reilly, has named Oprah the world\u2019s most powerful celebrity. For several years,  Forbes  listed Oprah as the highest paid African American in the United States, the world\u2019s only black billionaire, and the \ufb01  rst black billionaire in world history. Oprah\u2019s earnings top those of Tiger Woods, whose wealth is greater than that of any other athlete in the world, and she had, for a time, even more billions than J.) However, Oprah 18 OPRAH WINFREYremains the highest-earning media personality; reputedly, recently she signed a three-year contract that is said to bring her $55 million from XM satellite radio alone.  In contrast to the mixed assessments of polls and critics, public praise of Oprah is frequently hyperbolic. Many people go through periods of intense loyalty to entertainers in the music, television, and movie in-dustries, and Oprah\u2019s fans are among the most dedicated. Women\u2014there are far fewer men in attendance at her shows or reading her magazines\u2014laugh at her slightest suggestion of humor\u2014some quite earthy\u2014and cry when Oprah\u2019s eyes tear up. The worship-ful attitude has reached a point where some admirers have seriously suggested that Oprah be nominated as a vice presidential candidate.\u201d  The now-defunct  MS  magazine once repeated a fan\u2019s accolade, la-beling Oprah as the \u201cmost accessible and honest\u201d American psychia-trist. Oprah\u2019s television role in the daily lives of numerous viewers may or may not ful\ufb01  ll the calling of a doctor, but if one thinks of her many venues available to her followers, in addition to her support of psychol-ogist Dr. Phil\u2019s program \ufb01  ve days a week and his monthly column in her magazine,  O,  Oprah\u2019s role as psychiatrist to the nation is not untoward. Eva Illouz, in her book  Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery,  states, \u201cOprah shows us how to cope . Oprah sees her role as consummate helper. Oprah was so committed to seeing success of the law that she provided money to hire attorneys to protect children from sexual predators, and her name is frequently invoked in such matters. When the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, were the only subjects of the media for days, Oprah, along with other celebrities, was prominently featured as a participant in the healing process, using her daily program to move toward that goal. Oprah ap-peared with First Lady Laura Bush as they held hands in their shared grief over the thousands of lives lost in the assaults. For weeks after the horri\ufb01  c events, Oprah appeared to be everywhere, taking on, more than ever, the role of therapist to a troubled country.  At that time, Oprah was avowedly apolitical. However, toward the end of the Bush presidency, when Oprah became a partisan in the po-litical process as a supporter for Democratic candidates, she altered her impartial national role of therapist to the country. It is highly unlikely she will be called upon or volunteer to participate in any future events 20 OPRAH WINFREYpresented by a Republican administration. Her lover of many years, Stedman Graham, has been said to be an Obama supporter, and, al-though Graham is known as a staunch Republican, Oprah probably will no longer be on the A-list of desired speakers for his party.) Inasmuch as Oprah and Graham have usually gone in different directions in political matters, it cannot be of any great concern to her.  Because of her fame, we expect to \ufb01  nd library shelves \ufb01  lled with Oprah biographies of all kinds, but that assumption is incorrect. Some statements that lack dates could lead readers to believe something to be true of the mature Oprah, whereas she, like most of us, surely has altered some of her views over a period of time. Perhaps the best example is Oprah\u2019s change of heart about re-maining steadfastly outside the political arena. An entry in an encyclopedia erroneously lists the paternal rather than the maternal grandmother as the person with whom Oprah spent her early years. A 1990s biography lists a wrong birth date for Oprah. Another claims Oprah\u2019s mother married a man with whom she had a longtime relationship; in fact, she never married. One describes Oprah as short, a description completely at odds with reality, because she is \ufb01  ve foot six.  Even before opening some of the books about Oprah, readers are confronted with titles that usually contain words similar to the hype of advertisements such as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cremarkable. (At one time, Oprah planned to write her autobiography, but she was per-suaded to abandon the project because some of her intimates, including  THIS POWERFUL CELEBRITY 21Stedman Graham, believed it would be a detriment to her career.\u201d Nonetheless, it was always unlikely that Oprah would sanction it, and, when asked, Oprah stated she would have no input. Generally, informa-tion about Oprah is selective, and if she does not want something made public, it is carefully controlled when possible. Although it may appear that her life is an open book, because much is personal in nature, it is Oprah herself who determines what she tells readers of her thoughts and life story in her magazines and on radio and television. Titled  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid,  the author 22 OPRAH WINFREYCarrington Steele lambasts Oprah for her religious and spiritual views, something frequently done by bloggers.  Few books critical of Oprah are written by the professional press.

Several scholarly specialized books, each focusing on some aspect of Oprah\u2019s work or philosophy, have been published in recent years: one is about Oprah\u2019s concepts of religion; another explores her effect on U. One writer, Kathleen Rooney, the author of  Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America,  wrote a lengthy piece for the  Washington Post  in which she explores the stories that followed Oprah\u2019s support of Obama. )  There have been announcements of several books, among them another unauthorized biography of Oprah, as well as articles, books, and comic strips about her.  Over the years, Oprah has declared several times her intention to retire from her daily television program, but until September 2009, she kept changing the date. In 2009, Oprah tearfully announced the news. Still Oprah\u2019s wealth permits her to explore new ven-tures in many \ufb01  elds. 24 OPRAH WINFREY  4 . \u201cThe Other O-Factor in Oprah\u2019s Gentle Decline,\u201d  Guardian  (New York), 27 May 2008. \u201cThe Astrology behind Oprah\u2019s Thyroid Problem,\u201d 21 Apr.

On occasion, writers have compared daytime talk shows to soap opera because of the similarity of content, so it is not just happenstance that talk shows have replaced a number of soaps, although a few soaps have been able to keep going for decades, as have Oprah-type talk shows. Until recently, assertions that all talk shows, daytime and evening, had some of the same characteristics are now only partly ac-curate.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, producers have attempted to increase the shrinking numbers of viewers of their regular evening talk programs by inviting reputable and prominent journalists as guests.) Members of every recent administration also have become frequent guests on nighttime shows as well as Saturday and Sunday daytime talk programs. The popularity of the numerous weekend talk shows has networks vying for the same participants, who frequently go from one program to another.\u201d Daily talk shows have proliferated, and only some of the more offensive programs were discontinued even though many became more and more sensational when no topic was taboo. As they were being beamed in via television, the remarks and questions of those outside the studio focused on sex, sexual relationships, and activities.  Oprah had featured an entire episode introducing Skype to her viewers. Through the use of Skype, Oprah has been able to hold talks with anyone, anywhere, at any hour. Donahue\u2019s show had established the pattern not only for Oprah but for all the other daytime talk shows.  Donahue has turned away from talk shows to concentrate on serious documentaries. To keep people tuning in, it\u2019s necessary to provide variety in shows, and some topics have been extremely provocative. From the beginning, talk shows have run the gamut from sleazy to serious.  Meanwhile, other talk show hosts sometimes presented such offen-sive programs that one writer labeled them \u201cthe swamp. Some talk shows and newscasts turn painful or tragic events into entertainment.\u201d  Her shows, even with the variety of topics, often carry the same message. Nevertheless, in actuality, talk shows have very little spontaneity, although audiences have been led to believe that most talk shows are a type of shoot-from-the-hip production. In May 2009, Oprah\u2019s show focused on the deaths of two 11-year-old boys, one from the island of Saint Croix and one from Georgia. It is no surprise that the bene\ufb01  ts behind sales or image go in two directions\u2014to the talk show and to the purveyor of a brand or product. Most nighttime talk shows, with the exception of those hosted by comedi-ans, focus on news or politics.  Many people disagree about the signi\ufb01  cance of talk shows. Where some hosts hold a microphone while walking around, Oprah will sometimes sit in the audience and, on occasion speak with a few people during the break. The conversation may then serve as friendly transitions between the segments of the show that have been broken into frequently by advertisements.

Yet, almost always underlying the content of the talk shows are views that are conservative, conformist, and moralistic.\u201d Before the program, some members of the audience, in addition to the guests, also have had coaching, and during the show, the camera will focus on them.  Oprah\u2019s show is usually taped several weeks in advance of its airing, providing the producers the opportunity to edit it and exercise some control over what is shown. After leaks and ongoing speculation among television speakers and watchers, Oprah tearfully announced she was going to bring her net-work talk show to an end early in 2011. The new show is not be produced in Chicago.  A number of names have surfaced as possible replacements for Oprah\u2019s show\u2014more and more of them as the date draws closer for Oprah\u2019s departure.", "Oprah_Watchers_2009": " Of the seven Kurtz chose from both day-time and nighttime talk shows, Oprah was the only woman. Journalists designated Oprah the \u201cqueen of daytime television\u201d because of the large number of women who opted to watch her programs rather than other offerings, day or night. The subject matter of both daytime and evening programs may be the same\u2014that is, serious and important\u2014but 84 OPRAH WINFREYthe presentations have been worlds apart.\u201d Through her show and magazine, which reveal Oprah as a salesper-son of sentiment, good feeling, and self-improvement, Timson writes, \u201cWe have been given a transformative way to view our lives.  Perhaps the most basic reason for Oprah\u2019s ongoing popularity is the one given by an Internet entertainment writer, who saw her as \u201ca best girl friend to women.\u201d But Timson\u2019s view of Oprah\u2019s persona is that she makes herself \u201cindispensable. Blogs about controversial subjects concerning Oprah may cover 20 or 30 pages at a time. Numerous pages of angry blogs appeared on the Internet when Oprah refused to have Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on her show prior to the 2008 election. When Oprah did invite Sarah Palin to appear on her show after the election, the former candidate turned her down. However, once Palin had re-signed her position as Alaska\u2019s governor and had a book to market, she changed her mind and appeared on Oprah\u2019s show in November 2009, a year after the election. Oprah\u2019s role the critics found ei-ther sycophantic or supportive.  A few months after Palin\u2019s appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, her daugh-ter Bristol was the guest.  Inspired perhaps by Palin\u2019s mention of porn, the following day, Oprah returned to the type of discussion she had eschewed for awhile. As Michael Langston wrote in the  Examiner , \u201cOprah .\u201d That and the title of 86 OPRAH WINFREYthe lead story, \u201cMy Own Love Trap,\u201d could easily be today\u2019s program on television, not excluding Oprah\u2019s show (though the details of the story would surely have been far less explicit in the past).  Oprah\u2019s life is a favorite subject for these publications. First Lady Michelle Obama became the \ufb01  rst person to share the cover of Oprah\u2019s magazine since it was introduced. Interviews with presidential wives, not only on television but also in the magazine, have added to Oprah\u2019s cachet. Even a stand-in Oprah appeared on one of the programs. Oprah seemed not to object to the comedy show during the run-up to the election. Many of Oprah\u2019s shows have supported such discussions of intimate matters. Sometimes the comments by Oprah or visiting experts have been used to emphasize the uninhibited nature of the show or guests. She pushed 88 OPRAH WINFREYthe boundaries of transgender by having as a guest the \u201cpregnant\u201d Thomas Beatie, a transsexual who was on the show more than once and is a man who has twice given birth. Not long after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, Beatie gave birth to a daughter, and subsequently had another child.  Programs on sexual matters display many characteristics of Oprah\u2019s presentations, not only those dealing with intimate matters that ac-count for her large numbers of fans: before-and-after photos of guests, intimate relations, emotion, and humor.  Because of public interest\u2014or prurient interest\u2014in the matter of sex changes, the following year, staff from Harpo noti\ufb01  ed an Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, woman of the plan for Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show to have a program on sex-change surgery. Although there was no immediate date for Oprah\u2019s show, the studios were considering the subject of trans- MEDIA MOGUL 89sexuals.  Oprah had featured an entire episode introducing Skype to her viewers. Through the use of Skype, Oprah has been able to hold talks with anyone, anywhere, at any hour. And Oprah, who appears always ready to try new things, uses Facebook, YouTube, and T witter (al-though, reportedly, she has tired of this last one).  For her part, Oprah laughed along with the audience as Harvey joked about the surprisingly frank queries and revelations. So too did Oprah\u2019s.  When Oprah started in Chicago in 1984, nobody anticipated the effect her program would have. Having replaced the irreplaceable Phil 90 OPRAH WINFREYDonahue, she always credits him for his pioneering work on television in creating the one topic format that she emulated. Donahue\u2019s show had established the pattern not only for Oprah but for all the other daytime talk shows. In much the same way, Oprah has become more in-volved in other types of programs. Nevertheless, some of the criticism of Oprah by media critics still is valid. Writ-ers have noted occasions when Oprah became uncomfortable with the subjects on her program; though she appears to be less so with the pas-sage of time, it is re\ufb02  ective of changes in our culture. In that lineup, Oprah\u2019s programs have generally been ranked at the classy end in both style and execution, leading to her top ratings and many Emmy Awards, in-cluding a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Substantive alterations took place in Oprah\u2019s telecasts once she de-cided to raise the level of her programs. During the years that competi-tion increased among daytime talk shows and subject matter became more repugnant,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  made important strides toward abandoning the tawdry factor.\u201d Of course, not all audiences appreciated Oprah\u2019s efforts to offer more quality pro-grams. At times, viewers have been \ufb01  ckle, preferring to tune out Oprah and tune in other hosts or soap operas or game shows. But even critics, who usually \ufb01  nd daytime shows worthless, trashy, and objectionable, approved of some changes in Oprah\u2019s programs. The anti-Oprah critics voice dismay at the role she plays in U. Sensitivity to that subject has not changed over the years, so that Oprah\u2019s involvement with the movie  Precious  brought about more attacks on her judgment and supposed animosity. 92 OPRAH WINFREYClasses in literature often study the book, and the movie was Oprah\u2019s introduction as an actress; the show also was a hit on Broadway and elsewhere, with the current producer being Oprah Winfrey.\u201d The subject is one that Oprah has been interested in for years, primarily because of her own painful history as an abused, neglected child, raped by a family member and her mother\u2019s boyfriend.  There will be many more \ufb01  lms on Oprah\u2019s new network.\u201d No doubt the lives of women will continue to be a major theme and interest in Oprah\u2019s future work, just as her television programs have been.  Divorce has been a topic shown from several perspectives on Oprah\u2019s program. On another Oprah program, the issue of loyalty and disloyalty was explored, with guests consisting of a father and his two  MEDIA MOGUL 93children, Daisy and Chris, as well as a divorce counselor.  After Oprah asserted it is never too late to heal damage, another \ufb01  lm was shown on the program, featuring the same counselor and a 16-year-old girl, Ebony, who felt guilty about telling her father years earlier she had seen her mother embracing another man.  Oprah takes the opportunity to express a point of view she holds strongly: it is necessary for parents to talk to their children in situations of this nature. Oprah bluntly asks the mother whether she was aware that Ebony had seen her embracing another man. 94 OPRAH WINFREY Both Oprah and Neuman are in agreement that children need adults to talk to about important personal matters, and if they can\u2019t discuss such things with their parents, there must be adult friends to whom the children can turn. People familiar with Oprah\u2019s history understand the impetus behind her views. In support of such \ufb01  ndings, on one Oprah program, Oprah\u2019s guest, a professor from the University of Utah, discussed her 13-year study about women\u2019s sexuality, which resulted in the book  Sexual Fluidity.  Years ago, when Oprah decided to improve the nature of her pro-gram, more professional guests were added, so that a number of the is-sues discussed have had serious and thoughtful analysis. On days when the country has been eager for solace as well as information about signi\ufb01  cant current events such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economy, or careful consideration of other major happenings,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  attained stature commensurate with some of the best television offerings.  It seems prescient of Oprah and her staff to have had a show in September 2009 about health care in the United States; soon the sub-ject became a linchpin in the new president\u2019s program following his election\u2014but it became a topic that led to much controversy among  MEDIA MOGUL 95the electorate and, according to a number of election analysts, was a major factor in the loss of many Democratic governors and many Dem-ocratic seats in Congress. Michael Moore, maker of the \ufb01  lm  Sicko,  was a guest on Oprah\u2019s September 2009 show, \u201cSick in America. In preparation for the show, one of Oprah\u2019s em-ployees called several insurance companies about three different cases that needed health insurance, and in each instance the company rep-resentatives found reasons to deny coverage to the individuals.  When Oprah has experienced certain health issues herself, the entire world learns about her physical ailments while she shares personal in-formation. Nevertheless, when the hour devoted to perimenopause on Oprah\u2019s program came to an end, the e-mail response was so overwhelming that it caused Oprah\u2019s site to crash, as has happened after other programs viewers cared strongly about.  Several years ago, an Oprah program about postpartum depression explored the grim subject of mothers who injured or killed their chil-dren. It followed the structure of most Oprah shows, with different sto-ries, taped segments, testimony by some of those affected, an expert advisor\u2014usually a doctor\u2014and research data. The program provided much information and was different from the carnival setting and at-mosphere that often has surrounded other media presentations of the 96 OPRAH WINFREYsubject.  Emotion on Oprah\u2019s show is not always focused on the sorrowful. Every show has an advertising component, and Oprah mentions the names of the gift-giving companies several times throughout the hour.  Oprah periodically has taken to the road with a \u201cLive Your Best Life\u201d tour. It is not known whether Oprah will take it out on the road again.\u201d Oprah often refers to her work as a mission, and, according to the sta-tistics of  Fortune  magazine, these self-af\ufb01  rmation tours, which inspire the thousands of women ticketholders, bring in more than $1.  During a two-hour morning program, Oprah spoke about her child-hood on her grandmother\u2019s farm in Mississippi, and she spoke about her trip to Africa during the Christmas season.\u201d The two-hour afternoon sharing session, with speakers se-lected by Oprah, focused on the same types of problems aired then and now on her television shows: marriage, sickness, and weight. Yet when others on the program asked for advice, her response was humorous but not 98 OPRAH WINFREYhelpful: \u201cMove to Ireland,\u201d because it is a country in which nobody bothers you. Part of Oprah\u2019s program featured another victim of the illness, the former child star, Patty Duke, talking on \ufb01  lm with the guest and his mother. Another critic disputes Oprah\u2019s authenticity, labeling her a con artist.  Such behavior is attractive to the audience, and being seemingly unscripted allows Oprah to use her special type of humor that her au-dience delights in.\u201d Oprah seems to \ufb01  nd laughter in much that others would not. She engages the 100 OPRAH WINFREYaudience in the fun not only verbally but through body language\u2014a raised eyebrow, exaggerated eye movements, and other facial expres-sions and gestures.  When the program is given over to fashion, in which the theme may be a new look for the season, Oprah\u2019s humor punctuates everything: minidresses, denim, sweaters. Sometimes she will speak mockingly of her own body, and, as she looks at one of the sleek models, Oprah clowns; commenting on the wide separation between the breasts of the model, she asks with pseudo innocence, \u201chow do they do that. On occasion, the entire hour on the show features high-end designers whose pricey clothing might not \ufb01  t into the range of most Oprah watchers, but even if the audience doesn\u2019t buy the products, they enjoy the display. Oprah so enjoys shopping, not only for herself but for many other people, that her enthusiasm becomes infectious.  A serious subject that Oprah returns to periodically is bullying. Abduction of girls is a more alarming part of that pattern, a topic that Oprah has been determined to bring before the public. In attempting to keep the different types of violence an ongoing subject for her audience, Oprah wanted to interview Jaycee Dugard, a young woman who had been kidnapped 18 years before being found alive. Although Oprah had made her \ufb01  rst ever attempt to tell a producer she wanted to interview the young woman, the family refused.  Oprah, always determined to explore the hidden and secret elements of bullying that becomes violent, chose to bring the subject of domestic violence to her show in a program called \u201cThe Rihannas of the World. Be-cause of that, he thought Oprah should have been more helpful to him.  A reporter following the Rihanna episode on the show tracked down the ex-wife of a famous gospel star, BeBe Winans, who had been on Oprah\u2019s show a number of times. Yet, despite the ongoing court case, Oprah con-tinued to promote the gospel singer\u2019s albums, according to his ex-wife, Debra. Finally, the message reached Oprah, who then barred the singer from her show. In talking emotionally to her audience about violence, Oprah offered a grim statistic: one in four women and girls or more suffer from a form of domestic violence.  Not long after the airing of the show with Rihanna, Oprah had as her guest Connie Culp, a woman whose husband had shot her in the face with a shotgun several years earlier. The transplant saved her, although her photographs reveal a woman whose face can never be considered 102 OPRAH WINFREYnormal.  When Culp told Oprah she had considered taking Thomas back after completion of his prison term, Oprah asked her for reasons, which seemed inexplicable to both Oprah and her audience.  During the period that Oprah\u2019s show was focusing on the topic of abused women, a domestic violence shelter called New House was given a $10,000 grant by Oprah\u2019s Angel Network in October 2009; the money is to be used for ongoing activities in the program, which provides safe shelter, education about violence, and services to abused women and children.  Not long after Oprah\u2019s shows focused on the issue of violence, leading newspapers featured reviews of a book written by President Obama\u2019s half-brother.  Another horrifying incident of violence was the topic on Oprah\u2019s show in November 2009; but that time it was violence by an animal, a chimpanzee, on a helpless woman who lost her eyes, entire face, nose, lips, and hands. In May 2009, Oprah\u2019s show focused on the deaths of two 11-year-old boys, one from the island of Saint Croix and one from Georgia. Vulnerability in children is a topic Oprah has returned to again and again.  Still another Oprah program, as well as one on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show,  featured the bereaved mother of an 11-year-old boy who had committed suicide. Grief counselors have become part of American psychology, and Oprah has also had them on her program.  During the period that Oprah was focusing on violence and bully-ing, the question of hate crimes arose once again with the shooting and deaths of large numbers of soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in the fall of 2009. Although it was not possible for Oprah to be present in the hos-pital where the wounded were recovering, she interviewed one of the wounded soldiers, a woman, who was said to have \ufb01  red at the assailant as he shot her three times.  Violence as a social issue in the United States has long been an im-portant subject for Oprah.\u2019s, birthday, Oprah announced that she would undertake the topics of racism and the judicial system and race rela-tions. On all Oprah programs, advertising, which occurs every few minutes, consumes huge amounts of time. There are many women who not only look at merchandise on television but purchase articles Oprah recommends. On one program after Oprah called attention to a medicinal com-pound that supposedly enhances a woman\u2019s sex drive, she brought on a \ufb02 urry of phone calls to a small Maryland pharmacy making the custom mixture.  No matter the product, many affected companies have remarked on Oprah\u2019s extraordinary in\ufb02  uence on sales. Because of the con\ufb01  dence she has instilled in audiences, they will follow her recommendations, says the president of a branch of a publishing company, so that Oprah \u201ccre-ates markets all the time. But as Oprah gives prices, she soft-ens the fact that she is advertising, humorously noting that she wants the discount being offered. Finding almost everything Oprah does to be manip-ulative, commercial, and self-serving, one disgruntled former employee of Harpo published a screed about the star on the Internet. Claiming that Oprah has business ties or a quid pro quo arrangement with many 106 OPRAH WINFREYcorporations, networks, and publishing houses, the writer calls her a world-class phony who is able to deliver audiences because her name sells everything, and companies are not interested in how she does that.) The author, Elizabeth Coady, who had been a senior associate producer for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  wrote the piece as a form of protest against the con\ufb01  dentiality contract that restricts people for life for writing or talking about Oprah. Coady claims she wants to write a book about Oprah\u2019s operations, but the courts have upheld the agree-ments. A book called  Everybody Loves Oprah  quotes and names some hostile journalists. Bednarski of the  Chicago Sun-Times,  who wrote 20 years ago that Oprah was amoral about sexual matters and uninvolved with important moral and social issues. In the two decades that have passed since Bednarski criticized Oprah, many of her activities, as well as the praise she has earned for them, contradict Bednarski\u2019s statement. Because Oprah herself often voices her unhappiness when she gains weight, it became an important issue. However, Oprah\u2019s appearance over the years\u2014her hairdos, makeup, jewelry, and clothing\u2014reveal her as savvy about her looks.  The frequency of exposure on television is also a major factor in selling a product or, as Oprah\u2019s boyfriend Stedman Graham labels everything, a brand: books, movies, political positions, and even the politicians who espouse the positions. An Indian writer, Shraddha Jahagirdar-Saxena, however, points to Oprah\u2019s ability to reach out to everyone\u2014that is, \u201cthe common man\u201d\u2014with issues that affect many, such as weight, abuse, and discrimination. Her most attention-getting book is  Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America,   but she has also written analytically about the entertainment business, describing Oprah\u2019s shows as a type of lesson delivered in the guise of entertainment.  Although not all talk shows nor their audiences are the same, Oprah\u2019s live audience generally is 80 percent white, middle class, and female, and they want to hear about the problems of other women, even though the guests may very well conform to a different social, cultural, or economic group than the viewers. Such was the case with the story actress Mackenzie Phillips told on Oprah\u2019s show in September 2009, when she talked about her book and the \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d she had with her father. 108 OPRAH WINFREY The harshest media critics \ufb01  nd two opposing characteristics in day-time television: one is as ampli\ufb01  er and manipulator of the conven-tional, the ordinary, and the bland, which projects accepted stereotypes rather than exploring the wide differences in human behavior. Take the example on Oprah\u2019s programs ad-dressing the issue of cross-dressing and gender change: a guest\u2019s lifetime struggle; relationships with parents and siblings, wife, children, and the outside world; decisions; and results are all explored within the limi-tations of a television hour.  Although  The Oprah Winfrey Show  brings in outside stars, often from the entertainment world, daytime programming seems to prefer every- MEDIA MOGUL 109day, average guests, whereas evening programs seek professionals. Almost without excep-tion, viewers speak affectionately and admiringly of Oprah. Some, who 110 OPRAH WINFREYfollow every story about her, talk as if a close relationship exists between them and the star. Former Harpo producer Coady describes reactions of audiences at shows: they cry when Oprah enters her television studio, gush when she speaks to them directly, and long to be touched. Journal-ists write of occasions when Oprah has left the stage to hug a member of the audience who has revealed a traumatic experience. Everyone is on a \ufb01  rst-name basis, and most hosts, including Oprah, use personal pronouns as often as possible to create an informal atmosphere. Where some hosts hold a microphone while walking around, Oprah will sometimes sit in the audience and, on occasion speak with a few people during the break. All of this is true of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   The audience at an Oprah show only appears to be selected at ran-dom.  While guests wait until their names are called for admission to the studio, they are free to visit a gift shop that surprisingly (at least dur-ing Whitbourne\u2019s visit) sells almost no Oprah memorabilia. Those particular gifts received much attention in the press once the public learned the gift recipients had to pay taxes for the cars, which had not been purchased by Oprah but were an advertising gim-mick of one car dealer (and the occasion for snide remarks about the fact that Oprah and company were not the actual givers). Cars are but one of 112 OPRAH WINFREYthe items audiences have been gifted with. Over the years, Oprah has given away UGG boots to her staff as presents and also made them a must-have item for many others; Apple iPods; books galore; and shop-ping carts \ufb01  lled with products from sponsors.)  Gifts vary in cost and value, but one of Oprah\u2019s \u201cfavorite things\u201d to give away was a refrigerator that had a built-in television set and radio. Oprah wanted the audience to experience the feeling she has\u2014that gift giving is a source of happiness. Rumor has it that when Oprah moves to her own network, the \u201cfavorite things\u201d part of her shows will be abandoned.  Surprisingly, considering Oprah\u2019s reputation for generosity, there were no giveaways for the general audience at the show attended by Whitbourne.  Oprah\u2019s show is usually taped several weeks in advance of its airing, providing the producers the opportunity to edit it and exercise some control over what is shown. Critics may question Oprah\u2019s sincerity and view her as a skilled actress, but viewers see her as natural; they approve, laugh, and applaud her outspokenness; so implicit is their trust in Oprah, they do not seem to know or care that everything on the program is managed and not spontaneous.  Many writers\u2014journalists and scholars alike\u2014have emphasized the fact that Oprah is a highly visible black entertainer, but her audiences are predominantly white. Some of these perceptions result from Oprah\u2019s earlier re-moteness from both political activism and the civil rights movement. 114 OPRAH WINFREYHowever, it has also been pointed out that the commercial aspect of her show\u2014that is, the advertising\u2014requires maintenance of a neutral stance on race.  In her series on racism, however, Oprah did not remain neutral. Oprah\u2019s perspective agreed that racism is undesir-able, and her view on racism is described as \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d because she has said that \u201cthe lack of self esteem\u201d brings about \u201call the problems in the world.\u201d Oprah insists that racists are ignorant and afraid.  One black member of Oprah\u2019s audience in 1992 challenged the views expressed, telling her: \u201cListen Oprah, when you leave your show, you go to a lavish home.\u201d Oprah has been faulted for failing to pursue the matter of inequality in politics and economics. Similar to the framing of the race series, a number of Oprah Winfrey program subjects are topical matters that have been discussed in other media. Individual transformation is a staple, a building block in Oprah\u2019s philosophy, something she returns to again and again on the air and in person. After leaks and ongoing speculation among television speakers and watchers, Oprah tearfully announced she was going to bring her net-work talk show to an end early in 2011. They pointed to Oprah\u2019s savvy and almost unerring choices in her work of the last 25 years. Chicago writer Mark Brown for the  Chicago Sun-Times  mentioned rumors that Jerry Roper, president and CEO of the Chicagoland Cham-ber of Commerce, said that Oprah has been more than \u201ca local icon.  A number of names have surfaced as possible replacements for Oprah\u2019s show\u2014more and more of them as the date draws closer for Oprah\u2019s departure. However, another talk show and magazine entre-preneur, Martha Stewart, has apparently been in\ufb02  uenced by Oprah\u2019s decision to change to cable. Shortly after Oprah made her announce-ment, Stewart also made hers. T wo well-known people whose positions 116 OPRAH WINFREYon almost everything are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Oprah have been mentioned as possible replacements for Oprah.  As for Oprah, says her closest friend, Gayle King, there should not be, nor will there be, a \u201cpity party.\u201d After all, Oprah is leaving the pro-gram by choice and nothing else. A poll taken by the  Chicago Sun-Times   found, after Oprah\u2019s announcement of future change, that she remains America\u2019s favorite TV personality. Janice Peck, \u201cTalk about Racism: Framing a Popular Discourse of Race on  Oprah Winfrey, \u201d  Cultural Critique  (Spring 1994).", "Show_2009": "", "Oprah_Shows_2009": " Of the seven Kurtz chose from both day-time and nighttime talk shows, Oprah was the only woman. Journalists designated Oprah the \u201cqueen of daytime television\u201d because of the large number of women who opted to watch her programs rather than other offerings, day or night. The subject matter of both daytime and evening programs may be the same\u2014that is, serious and important\u2014but 84 OPRAH WINFREYthe presentations have been worlds apart.\u201d Through her show and magazine, which reveal Oprah as a salesper-son of sentiment, good feeling, and self-improvement, Timson writes, \u201cWe have been given a transformative way to view our lives.\u201d So sig-ni\ufb01 cant is  The Oprah Winfrey Show  that toward the end of 2008 it was added to the Spanish-language offerings for secondary schools in six major Hispanic television markets: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Houston, Miami, and Dallas.  Perhaps the most basic reason for Oprah\u2019s ongoing popularity is the one given by an Internet entertainment writer, who saw her as \u201ca best girl friend to women.\u201d But Timson\u2019s view of Oprah\u2019s persona is that she makes herself \u201cindispensable. Blogs about controversial subjects concerning Oprah may cover 20 or 30 pages at a time. Numerous pages of angry blogs appeared on the Internet when Oprah refused to have Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on her show prior to the 2008 election. When Oprah did invite Sarah Palin to appear on her show after the election, the former candidate turned her down. However, once Palin had re-signed her position as Alaska\u2019s governor and had a book to market, she changed her mind and appeared on Oprah\u2019s show in November 2009, a year after the election. Oprah\u2019s role the critics found ei-ther sycophantic or supportive.  A few months after Palin\u2019s appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, her daugh-ter Bristol was the guest.  Inspired perhaps by Palin\u2019s mention of porn, the following day, Oprah returned to the type of discussion she had eschewed for awhile. As Michael Langston wrote in the  Examiner , \u201cOprah .\u201d That and the title of 86 OPRAH WINFREYthe lead story, \u201cMy Own Love Trap,\u201d could easily be today\u2019s program on television, not excluding Oprah\u2019s show (though the details of the story would surely have been far less explicit in the past).  Oprah\u2019s life is a favorite subject for these publications. First Lady Michelle Obama became the \ufb01  rst person to share the cover of Oprah\u2019s magazine since it was introduced. Interviews with presidential wives, not only on television but also in the magazine, have added to Oprah\u2019s cachet. Palin also was a guest for one episode of the show. Even a stand-in Oprah appeared on one of the programs. Oprah seemed not to object to the comedy show during the run-up to the election. Many of Oprah\u2019s shows have supported such discussions of intimate matters. Sometimes the comments by Oprah or visiting experts have been used to emphasize the uninhibited nature of the show or guests. In addition to programs about homosexuality, Oprah raised the subject of husbands who have had sex changes. She pushed 88 OPRAH WINFREYthe boundaries of transgender by having as a guest the \u201cpregnant\u201d Thomas Beatie, a transsexual who was on the show more than once and is a man who has twice given birth. Not long after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, Beatie gave birth to a daughter, and subsequently had another child.  Programs on sexual matters display many characteristics of Oprah\u2019s presentations, not only those dealing with intimate matters that ac-count for her large numbers of fans: before-and-after photos of guests, intimate relations, emotion, and humor. Berman will continue to appear on fu-ture programs when Oprah moves to OWN.  Because of public interest\u2014or prurient interest\u2014in the matter of sex changes, the following year, staff from Harpo noti\ufb01  ed an Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, woman of the plan for Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show to have a program on sex-change surgery. Although there was no immediate date for Oprah\u2019s show, the studios were considering the subject of trans- MEDIA MOGUL 89sexuals.  With a live audience apparently consisting entirely of women, as well as preselected women on Skype (the Internet calling system) from various cities who asked questions that seemed previewed, Harvey\u2019s appearance on Oprah\u2019s show was a combination of fact and humor about the war between men and women.  Oprah had featured an entire episode introducing Skype to her viewers. Through the use of Skype, Oprah has been able to hold talks with anyone, anywhere, at any hour. And Oprah, who appears always ready to try new things, uses Facebook, YouTube, and T witter (al-though, reportedly, she has tired of this last one).  For her part, Oprah laughed along with the audience as Harvey joked about the surprisingly frank queries and revelations. So too did Oprah\u2019s.  When Oprah started in Chicago in 1984, nobody anticipated the effect her program would have. Having replaced the irreplaceable Phil 90 OPRAH WINFREYDonahue, she always credits him for his pioneering work on television in creating the one topic format that she emulated. Donahue\u2019s show had established the pattern not only for Oprah but for all the other daytime talk shows. In much the same way, Oprah has become more in-volved in other types of programs. Nevertheless, some of the criticism of Oprah by media critics still is valid. Writ-ers have noted occasions when Oprah became uncomfortable with the subjects on her program; though she appears to be less so with the pas-sage of time, it is re\ufb02  ective of changes in our culture. In that lineup, Oprah\u2019s programs have generally been ranked at the classy end in both style and execution, leading to her top ratings and many Emmy Awards, in-cluding a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Substantive alterations took place in Oprah\u2019s telecasts once she de-cided to raise the level of her programs. During the years that competi-tion increased among daytime talk shows and subject matter became more repugnant,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  made important strides toward abandoning the tawdry factor. Ironically, they seem to be among the audience for her shows.\u201d Of course, not all audiences appreciated Oprah\u2019s efforts to offer more quality pro-grams. At times, viewers have been \ufb01  ckle, preferring to tune out Oprah and tune in other hosts or soap operas or game shows. But even critics, who usually \ufb01  nd daytime shows worthless, trashy, and objectionable, approved of some changes in Oprah\u2019s programs. The anti-Oprah critics voice dismay at the role she plays in U. Sensitivity to that subject has not changed over the years, so that Oprah\u2019s involvement with the movie  Precious  brought about more attacks on her judgment and supposed animosity. 92 OPRAH WINFREYClasses in literature often study the book, and the movie was Oprah\u2019s introduction as an actress; the show also was a hit on Broadway and elsewhere, with the current producer being Oprah Winfrey.\u201d The subject is one that Oprah has been interested in for years, primarily because of her own painful history as an abused, neglected child, raped by a family member and her mother\u2019s boyfriend.  There will be many more \ufb01  lms on Oprah\u2019s new network.\u201d No doubt the lives of women will continue to be a major theme and interest in Oprah\u2019s future work, just as her television programs have been.  Divorce has been a topic shown from several perspectives on Oprah\u2019s program. On another Oprah program, the issue of loyalty and disloyalty was explored, with guests consisting of a father and his two  MEDIA MOGUL 93children, Daisy and Chris, as well as a divorce counselor. When Oprah speaks of the rage that children can develop, the guest counselor explains that children must express their feelings; however, it must be the parent who approaches the child for such a discussion in order to take the pressure off.  After Oprah asserted it is never too late to heal damage, another \ufb01  lm was shown on the program, featuring the same counselor and a 16-year-old girl, Ebony, who felt guilty about telling her father years earlier she had seen her mother embracing another man.  Oprah takes the opportunity to express a point of view she holds strongly: it is necessary for parents to talk to their children in situations of this nature. Oprah bluntly asks the mother whether she was aware that Ebony had seen her embracing another man. 94 OPRAH WINFREY Both Oprah and Neuman are in agreement that children need adults to talk to about important personal matters, and if they can\u2019t discuss such things with their parents, there must be adult friends to whom the children can turn. People familiar with Oprah\u2019s history understand the impetus behind her views. In support of such \ufb01  ndings, on one Oprah program, Oprah\u2019s guest, a professor from the University of Utah, discussed her 13-year study about women\u2019s sexuality, which resulted in the book  Sexual Fluidity.  Years ago, when Oprah decided to improve the nature of her pro-gram, more professional guests were added, so that a number of the is-sues discussed have had serious and thoughtful analysis. On days when the country has been eager for solace as well as information about signi\ufb01  cant current events such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economy, or careful consideration of other major happenings,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  attained stature commensurate with some of the best television offerings.  It seems prescient of Oprah and her staff to have had a show in September 2009 about health care in the United States; soon the sub-ject became a linchpin in the new president\u2019s program following his election\u2014but it became a topic that led to much controversy among  MEDIA MOGUL 95the electorate and, according to a number of election analysts, was a major factor in the loss of many Democratic governors and many Dem-ocratic seats in Congress. Michael Moore, maker of the \ufb01  lm  Sicko,  was a guest on Oprah\u2019s September 2009 show, \u201cSick in America. In preparation for the show, one of Oprah\u2019s em-ployees called several insurance companies about three different cases that needed health insurance, and in each instance the company rep-resentatives found reasons to deny coverage to the individuals.  When Oprah has experienced certain health issues herself, the entire world learns about her physical ailments while she shares personal in-formation. Nevertheless, when the hour devoted to perimenopause on Oprah\u2019s program came to an end, the e-mail response was so overwhelming that it caused Oprah\u2019s site to crash, as has happened after other programs viewers cared strongly about.  Several years ago, an Oprah program about postpartum depression explored the grim subject of mothers who injured or killed their chil-dren. It followed the structure of most Oprah shows, with different sto-ries, taped segments, testimony by some of those affected, an expert advisor\u2014usually a doctor\u2014and research data. The program provided much information and was different from the carnival setting and at-mosphere that often has surrounded other media presentations of the 96 OPRAH WINFREYsubject.  Emotion on Oprah\u2019s show is not always focused on the sorrowful. Every show has an advertising component, and Oprah mentions the names of the gift-giving companies several times throughout the hour.  Oprah periodically has taken to the road with a \u201cLive Your Best Life\u201d tour. It is not known whether Oprah will take it out on the road again.\u201d Oprah often refers to her work as a mission, and, according to the sta-tistics of  Fortune  magazine, these self-af\ufb01  rmation tours, which inspire the thousands of women ticketholders, bring in more than $1.  During a two-hour morning program, Oprah spoke about her child-hood on her grandmother\u2019s farm in Mississippi, and she spoke about her trip to Africa during the Christmas season.\u201d The two-hour afternoon sharing session, with speakers se-lected by Oprah, focused on the same types of problems aired then and now on her television shows: marriage, sickness, and weight. Yet when others on the program asked for advice, her response was humorous but not 98 OPRAH WINFREYhelpful: \u201cMove to Ireland,\u201d because it is a country in which nobody bothers you. Part of Oprah\u2019s program featured another victim of the illness, the former child star, Patty Duke, talking on \ufb01  lm with the guest and his mother.  Much ink has been spent on Oprah\u2019s style, which is always touted as refreshingly extemporaneous; that is, she doesn\u2019t like prepared scripts for herself, preferring a looser, more folksy approach. Another critic disputes Oprah\u2019s authenticity, labeling her a con artist. Another voice in the conversation, well-known authority on male and female speech patterns Deborah Tannen, has spoken of Oprah\u2019s natural ability with rapport talk, which is typical of women\u2019s conversational patterns.  Such behavior is attractive to the audience, and being seemingly unscripted allows Oprah to use her special type of humor that her au-dience delights in. On a show dealing with marital issues, Oprah in-jects humor that lightens the tension: you have great sex; you\u2019re rolling around in bed, having a great time, and then the next morning \ufb01  nd he\u2019s still an idiot. A memorable example occurred on  Saturday Night Live,  when the actor satirized both Oprah and the title of a play with a portrayal of her inter-viewing \ufb01  rst ladies in a session called \u201cThe Vagina Monologues.\u201d Oprah seems to \ufb01  nd laughter in much that others would not. She engages the 100 OPRAH WINFREYaudience in the fun not only verbally but through body language\u2014a raised eyebrow, exaggerated eye movements, and other facial expres-sions and gestures.  When the program is given over to fashion, in which the theme may be a new look for the season, Oprah\u2019s humor punctuates everything: minidresses, denim, sweaters. Sometimes she will speak mockingly of her own body, and, as she looks at one of the sleek models, Oprah clowns; commenting on the wide separation between the breasts of the model, she asks with pseudo innocence, \u201chow do they do that. On occasion, the entire hour on the show features high-end designers whose pricey clothing might not \ufb01  t into the range of most Oprah watchers, but even if the audience doesn\u2019t buy the products, they enjoy the display. Oprah so enjoys shopping, not only for herself but for many other people, that her enthusiasm becomes infectious.  A serious subject that Oprah returns to periodically is bullying. One of her most memorable instances occurred when two young women au-thors were guests on the show early in the 2000s. Abduction of girls is a more alarming part of that pattern, a topic that Oprah has been determined to bring before the public. In attempting to keep the different types of violence an ongoing subject for her audience, Oprah wanted to interview Jaycee Dugard, a young woman who had been kidnapped 18 years before being found alive. Although Oprah had made her \ufb01  rst ever attempt to tell a producer she wanted to interview the young woman, the family refused.  Oprah, always determined to explore the hidden and secret elements of bullying that becomes violent, chose to bring the subject of domestic violence to her show in a program called \u201cThe Rihannas of the World.\u201d Oprah used as prime examples two famous stars of the music world, Rihanna Fenty and her boyfriend, Chris Brown. Be-cause of that, he thought Oprah should have been more helpful to him.  A reporter following the Rihanna episode on the show tracked down the ex-wife of a famous gospel star, BeBe Winans, who had been on Oprah\u2019s show a number of times. Yet, despite the ongoing court case, Oprah con-tinued to promote the gospel singer\u2019s albums, according to his ex-wife, Debra. Finally, the message reached Oprah, who then barred the singer from her show. In talking emotionally to her audience about violence, Oprah offered a grim statistic: one in four women and girls or more suffer from a form of domestic violence.  Not long after the airing of the show with Rihanna, Oprah had as her guest Connie Culp, a woman whose husband had shot her in the face with a shotgun several years earlier. The transplant saved her, although her photographs reveal a woman whose face can never be considered 102 OPRAH WINFREYnormal.  When Culp told Oprah she had considered taking Thomas back after completion of his prison term, Oprah asked her for reasons, which seemed inexplicable to both Oprah and her audience.  During the period that Oprah\u2019s show was focusing on the topic of abused women, a domestic violence shelter called New House was given a $10,000 grant by Oprah\u2019s Angel Network in October 2009; the money is to be used for ongoing activities in the program, which provides safe shelter, education about violence, and services to abused women and children.  Not long after Oprah\u2019s shows focused on the issue of violence, leading newspapers featured reviews of a book written by President Obama\u2019s half-brother.  Another horrifying incident of violence was the topic on Oprah\u2019s show in November 2009; but that time it was violence by an animal, a chimpanzee, on a helpless woman who lost her eyes, entire face, nose, lips, and hands. In May 2009, Oprah\u2019s show focused on the deaths of two 11-year-old boys, one from the island of Saint Croix and one from Georgia. Vulnerability in children is a topic Oprah has returned to again and again.  Still another Oprah program, as well as one on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show,  featured the bereaved mother of an 11-year-old boy who had committed suicide.  During the period that Oprah was focusing on violence and bully-ing, the question of hate crimes arose once again with the shooting and deaths of large numbers of soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in the fall of 2009.  Violence as a social issue in the United States has long been an im-portant subject for Oprah.\u2019s, birthday, Oprah announced that she would undertake the topics of racism and the judicial system and race rela-tions. On all Oprah programs, advertising, which occurs every few minutes, consumes huge amounts of time. There are many women who not only look at merchandise on television but purchase articles Oprah recommends. On one program after Oprah called attention to a medicinal com-pound that supposedly enhances a woman\u2019s sex drive, she brought on a \ufb02 urry of phone calls to a small Maryland pharmacy making the custom mixture.  No matter the product, many affected companies have remarked on Oprah\u2019s extraordinary in\ufb02  uence on sales. Because of the con\ufb01  dence she has instilled in audiences, they will follow her recommendations, says the president of a branch of a publishing company, so that Oprah \u201ccre-ates markets all the time.\u201d When a show provided a demonstration by Art Smith, author of  Back to the Table  and Oprah\u2019s former chef, the presentation gave Oprah another opportunity to clown and do a bit of sashaying around as she proclaimed her love of potatoes. But as Oprah gives prices, she soft-ens the fact that she is advertising, humorously noting that she wants the discount being offered. Finding almost everything Oprah does to be manip-ulative, commercial, and self-serving, one disgruntled former employee of Harpo published a screed about the star on the Internet. Claiming that Oprah has business ties or a quid pro quo arrangement with many 106 OPRAH WINFREYcorporations, networks, and publishing houses, the writer calls her a world-class phony who is able to deliver audiences because her name sells everything, and companies are not interested in how she does that.) The author, Elizabeth Coady, who had been a senior associate producer for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  wrote the piece as a form of protest against the con\ufb01  dentiality contract that restricts people for life for writing or talking about Oprah. Coady claims she wants to write a book about Oprah\u2019s operations, but the courts have upheld the agree-ments. A book called  Everybody Loves Oprah  quotes and names some hostile journalists. Bednarski of the  Chicago Sun-Times,  who wrote 20 years ago that Oprah was amoral about sexual matters and uninvolved with important moral and social issues. In the two decades that have passed since Bednarski criticized Oprah, many of her activities, as well as the praise she has earned for them, contradict Bednarski\u2019s statement. Because Oprah herself often voices her unhappiness when she gains weight, it became an important issue. However, Oprah\u2019s appearance over the years\u2014her hairdos, makeup, jewelry, and clothing\u2014reveal her as savvy about her looks.  The frequency of exposure on television is also a major factor in selling a product or, as Oprah\u2019s boyfriend Stedman Graham labels everything, a brand: books, movies, political positions, and even the politicians who espouse the positions. An Indian writer, Shraddha Jahagirdar-Saxena, however, points to Oprah\u2019s ability to reach out to everyone\u2014that is, \u201cthe common man\u201d\u2014with issues that affect many, such as weight, abuse, and discrimination. Her most attention-getting book is  Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America,   but she has also written analytically about the entertainment business, describing Oprah\u2019s shows as a type of lesson delivered in the guise of entertainment.  Although not all talk shows nor their audiences are the same, Oprah\u2019s live audience generally is 80 percent white, middle class, and female, and they want to hear about the problems of other women, even though the guests may very well conform to a different social, cultural, or economic group than the viewers. Such was the case with the story actress Mackenzie Phillips told on Oprah\u2019s show in September 2009, when she talked about her book and the \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d she had with her father. 108 OPRAH WINFREY The harshest media critics \ufb01  nd two opposing characteristics in day-time television: one is as ampli\ufb01  er and manipulator of the conven-tional, the ordinary, and the bland, which projects accepted stereotypes rather than exploring the wide differences in human behavior. Take the example on Oprah\u2019s programs ad-dressing the issue of cross-dressing and gender change: a guest\u2019s lifetime struggle; relationships with parents and siblings, wife, children, and the outside world; decisions; and results are all explored within the limi-tations of a television hour. Although both use celebrities and/or experts, the numbers are not the same; daytime shows by and large, except for their hosts, are usually not dependent on such outside stars or pundits.  Although  The Oprah Winfrey Show  brings in outside stars, often from the entertainment world, daytime programming seems to prefer every- MEDIA MOGUL 109day, average guests, whereas evening programs seek professionals. Almost without excep-tion, viewers speak affectionately and admiringly of Oprah. Some, who 110 OPRAH WINFREYfollow every story about her, talk as if a close relationship exists between them and the star. Former Harpo producer Coady describes reactions of audiences at shows: they cry when Oprah enters her television studio, gush when she speaks to them directly, and long to be touched. Journal-ists write of occasions when Oprah has left the stage to hug a member of the audience who has revealed a traumatic experience. Everyone is on a \ufb01  rst-name basis, and most hosts, including Oprah, use personal pronouns as often as possible to create an informal atmosphere. Where some hosts hold a microphone while walking around, Oprah will sometimes sit in the audience and, on occasion speak with a few people during the break. All of this is true of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   The audience at an Oprah show only appears to be selected at ran-dom.  While guests wait until their names are called for admission to the studio, they are free to visit a gift shop that surprisingly (at least dur-ing Whitbourne\u2019s visit) sells almost no Oprah memorabilia. Those particular gifts received much attention in the press once the public learned the gift recipients had to pay taxes for the cars, which had not been purchased by Oprah but were an advertising gim-mick of one car dealer (and the occasion for snide remarks about the fact that Oprah and company were not the actual givers). Cars are but one of 112 OPRAH WINFREYthe items audiences have been gifted with. Over the years, Oprah has given away UGG boots to her staff as presents and also made them a must-have item for many others; Apple iPods; books galore; and shop-ping carts \ufb01  lled with products from sponsors.)  Gifts vary in cost and value, but one of Oprah\u2019s \u201cfavorite things\u201d to give away was a refrigerator that had a built-in television set and radio. Oprah wanted the audience to experience the feeling she has\u2014that gift giving is a source of happiness. Rumor has it that when Oprah moves to her own network, the \u201cfavorite things\u201d part of her shows will be abandoned.  Surprisingly, considering Oprah\u2019s reputation for generosity, there were no giveaways for the general audience at the show attended by Whitbourne.  Oprah\u2019s show is usually taped several weeks in advance of its airing, providing the producers the opportunity to edit it and exercise some control over what is shown. Critics may question Oprah\u2019s sincerity and view her as a skilled actress, but viewers see her as natural; they approve, laugh, and applaud her outspokenness; so implicit is their trust in Oprah, they do not seem to know or care that everything on the program is managed and not spontaneous.  Many writers\u2014journalists and scholars alike\u2014have emphasized the fact that Oprah is a highly visible black entertainer, but her audiences are predominantly white. Some of these perceptions result from Oprah\u2019s earlier re-moteness from both political activism and the civil rights movement. 114 OPRAH WINFREYHowever, it has also been pointed out that the commercial aspect of her show\u2014that is, the advertising\u2014requires maintenance of a neutral stance on race.  In her series on racism, however, Oprah did not remain neutral. Oprah\u2019s perspective agreed that racism is undesir-able, and her view on racism is described as \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d because she has said that \u201cthe lack of self esteem\u201d brings about \u201call the problems in the world.\u201d Oprah insists that racists are ignorant and afraid.  One black member of Oprah\u2019s audience in 1992 challenged the views expressed, telling her: \u201cListen Oprah, when you leave your show, you go to a lavish home.\u201d Oprah has been faulted for failing to pursue the matter of inequality in politics and economics. Similar to the framing of the race series, a number of Oprah Winfrey program subjects are topical matters that have been discussed in other media. Individual transformation is a staple, a building block in Oprah\u2019s philosophy, something she returns to again and again on the air and in person. After leaks and ongoing speculation among television speakers and watchers, Oprah tearfully announced she was going to bring her net-work talk show to an end early in 2011. They pointed to Oprah\u2019s savvy and almost unerring choices in her work of the last 25 years. Chicago writer Mark Brown for the  Chicago Sun-Times  mentioned rumors that Jerry Roper, president and CEO of the Chicagoland Cham-ber of Commerce, said that Oprah has been more than \u201ca local icon.  A number of names have surfaced as possible replacements for Oprah\u2019s show\u2014more and more of them as the date draws closer for Oprah\u2019s departure. However, another talk show and magazine entre-preneur, Martha Stewart, has apparently been in\ufb02  uenced by Oprah\u2019s decision to change to cable. Shortly after Oprah made her announce-ment, Stewart also made hers. T wo well-known people whose positions 116 OPRAH WINFREYon almost everything are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Oprah have been mentioned as possible replacements for Oprah. Palin has numerous admirers, but she has not had a television show; Beck not only has had his own show, but also was said to bring in more viewers of other talk shows among longtime Fox performers.\u201d Though it now appears unlikely, if Beck does replace  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  he would pro-vide the television critics and audience with much material to discuss.  As for Oprah, says her closest friend, Gayle King, there should not be, nor will there be, a \u201cpity party.\u201d After all, Oprah is leaving the pro-gram by choice and nothing else. A poll taken by the  Chicago Sun-Times   found, after Oprah\u2019s announcement of future change, that she remains America\u2019s favorite TV personality. Janice Peck, \u201cTalk about Racism: Framing a Popular Discourse of Race on  Oprah Winfrey, \u201d  Cultural Critique  (Spring 1994).", "Popular_Culture_2009": " The links between such older forms of popular culture and today\u2019s talk shows reveal a comparable selection of subjects considered appealing to women. The variety of subjects and guests obviously account in part for the popularity and durability. culture and daily existence that many of the reviews, articles, and books begin to sound the same.  MEDIA MOGUL 107 Almost every study of popular culture \ufb01  nds that television blurs the diversity of U. life and culture.", "Oprah_Winfreythe_Items_Audiences_2009": " Of the seven Kurtz chose from both day-time and nighttime talk shows, Oprah was the only woman. Journalists designated Oprah the \u201cqueen of daytime television\u201d because of the large number of women who opted to watch her programs rather than other offerings, day or night. The subject matter of both daytime and evening programs may be the same\u2014that is, serious and important\u2014but 84 OPRAH WINFREYthe presentations have been worlds apart.\u201d Through her show and magazine, which reveal Oprah as a salesper-son of sentiment, good feeling, and self-improvement, Timson writes, \u201cWe have been given a transformative way to view our lives.  Perhaps the most basic reason for Oprah\u2019s ongoing popularity is the one given by an Internet entertainment writer, who saw her as \u201ca best girl friend to women.\u201d But Timson\u2019s view of Oprah\u2019s persona is that she makes herself \u201cindispensable. Oprah\u2019s role the critics found ei-ther sycophantic or supportive.  Inspired perhaps by Palin\u2019s mention of porn, the following day, Oprah returned to the type of discussion she had eschewed for awhile.\u201d That and the title of 86 OPRAH WINFREYthe lead story, \u201cMy Own Love Trap,\u201d could easily be today\u2019s program on television, not excluding Oprah\u2019s show (though the details of the story would surely have been far less explicit in the past).  Oprah\u2019s life is a favorite subject for these publications. First Lady Michelle Obama became the \ufb01  rst person to share the cover of Oprah\u2019s magazine since it was introduced. Interviews with presidential wives, not only on television but also in the magazine, have added to Oprah\u2019s cachet. Even a stand-in Oprah appeared on one of the programs. Oprah seemed not to object to the comedy show during the run-up to the election. Many of Oprah\u2019s shows have supported such discussions of intimate matters. Sometimes the comments by Oprah or visiting experts have been used to emphasize the uninhibited nature of the show or guests. She pushed 88 OPRAH WINFREYthe boundaries of transgender by having as a guest the \u201cpregnant\u201d Thomas Beatie, a transsexual who was on the show more than once and is a man who has twice given birth.  Programs on sexual matters display many characteristics of Oprah\u2019s presentations, not only those dealing with intimate matters that ac-count for her large numbers of fans: before-and-after photos of guests, intimate relations, emotion, and humor.  Because of public interest\u2014or prurient interest\u2014in the matter of sex changes, the following year, staff from Harpo noti\ufb01  ed an Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, woman of the plan for Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show to have a program on sex-change surgery. Although there was no immediate date for Oprah\u2019s show, the studios were considering the subject of trans- MEDIA MOGUL 89sexuals.  With a live audience apparently consisting entirely of women, as well as preselected women on Skype (the Internet calling system) from various cities who asked questions that seemed previewed, Harvey\u2019s appearance on Oprah\u2019s show was a combination of fact and humor about the war between men and women.  Oprah had featured an entire episode introducing Skype to her viewers. And Oprah, who appears always ready to try new things, uses Facebook, YouTube, and T witter (al-though, reportedly, she has tired of this last one). So too did Oprah\u2019s.  When Oprah started in Chicago in 1984, nobody anticipated the effect her program would have. Having replaced the irreplaceable Phil 90 OPRAH WINFREYDonahue, she always credits him for his pioneering work on television in creating the one topic format that she emulated. Donahue\u2019s show had established the pattern not only for Oprah but for all the other daytime talk shows. In much the same way, Oprah has become more in-volved in other types of programs. Nevertheless, some of the criticism of Oprah by media critics still is valid. Writ-ers have noted occasions when Oprah became uncomfortable with the subjects on her program; though she appears to be less so with the pas-sage of time, it is re\ufb02  ective of changes in our culture. In that lineup, Oprah\u2019s programs have generally been ranked at the classy end in both style and execution, leading to her top ratings and many Emmy Awards, in-cluding a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Substantive alterations took place in Oprah\u2019s telecasts once she de-cided to raise the level of her programs. During the years that competi-tion increased among daytime talk shows and subject matter became more repugnant,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  made important strides toward abandoning the tawdry factor. Ironically, they seem to be among the audience for her shows.\u201d Of course, not all audiences appreciated Oprah\u2019s efforts to offer more quality pro-grams. At times, viewers have been \ufb01  ckle, preferring to tune out Oprah and tune in other hosts or soap operas or game shows. But even critics, who usually \ufb01  nd daytime shows worthless, trashy, and objectionable, approved of some changes in Oprah\u2019s programs. The anti-Oprah critics voice dismay at the role she plays in U. Sensitivity to that subject has not changed over the years, so that Oprah\u2019s involvement with the movie  Precious  brought about more attacks on her judgment and supposed animosity. 92 OPRAH WINFREYClasses in literature often study the book, and the movie was Oprah\u2019s introduction as an actress; the show also was a hit on Broadway and elsewhere, with the current producer being Oprah Winfrey.\u201d The subject is one that Oprah has been interested in for years, primarily because of her own painful history as an abused, neglected child, raped by a family member and her mother\u2019s boyfriend.  There will be many more \ufb01  lms on Oprah\u2019s new network.\u201d No doubt the lives of women will continue to be a major theme and interest in Oprah\u2019s future work, just as her television programs have been. On another Oprah program, the issue of loyalty and disloyalty was explored, with guests consisting of a father and his two  MEDIA MOGUL 93children, Daisy and Chris, as well as a divorce counselor.  Oprah takes the opportunity to express a point of view she holds strongly: it is necessary for parents to talk to their children in situations of this nature. 94 OPRAH WINFREY Both Oprah and Neuman are in agreement that children need adults to talk to about important personal matters, and if they can\u2019t discuss such things with their parents, there must be adult friends to whom the children can turn. People familiar with Oprah\u2019s history understand the impetus behind her views. In support of such \ufb01  ndings, on one Oprah program, Oprah\u2019s guest, a professor from the University of Utah, discussed her 13-year study about women\u2019s sexuality, which resulted in the book  Sexual Fluidity.  Years ago, when Oprah decided to improve the nature of her pro-gram, more professional guests were added, so that a number of the is-sues discussed have had serious and thoughtful analysis. On days when the country has been eager for solace as well as information about signi\ufb01  cant current events such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economy, or careful consideration of other major happenings,  The Oprah Winfrey Show  attained stature commensurate with some of the best television offerings. In preparation for the show, one of Oprah\u2019s em-ployees called several insurance companies about three different cases that needed health insurance, and in each instance the company rep-resentatives found reasons to deny coverage to the individuals. It followed the structure of most Oprah shows, with different sto-ries, taped segments, testimony by some of those affected, an expert advisor\u2014usually a doctor\u2014and research data. The program provided much information and was different from the carnival setting and at-mosphere that often has surrounded other media presentations of the 96 OPRAH WINFREYsubject. Every show has an advertising component, and Oprah mentions the names of the gift-giving companies several times throughout the hour. The variety of subjects and guests obviously account in part for the popularity and durability.\u201d Oprah often refers to her work as a mission, and, according to the sta-tistics of  Fortune  magazine, these self-af\ufb01  rmation tours, which inspire the thousands of women ticketholders, bring in more than $1.  During a two-hour morning program, Oprah spoke about her child-hood on her grandmother\u2019s farm in Mississippi, and she spoke about her trip to Africa during the Christmas season.\u201d The two-hour afternoon sharing session, with speakers se-lected by Oprah, focused on the same types of problems aired then and now on her television shows: marriage, sickness, and weight.  Such behavior is attractive to the audience, and being seemingly unscripted allows Oprah to use her special type of humor that her au-dience delights in.\u201d Oprah seems to \ufb01  nd laughter in much that others would not. She engages the 100 OPRAH WINFREYaudience in the fun not only verbally but through body language\u2014a raised eyebrow, exaggerated eye movements, and other facial expres-sions and gestures.  When the program is given over to fashion, in which the theme may be a new look for the season, Oprah\u2019s humor punctuates everything: minidresses, denim, sweaters. On occasion, the entire hour on the show features high-end designers whose pricey clothing might not \ufb01  t into the range of most Oprah watchers, but even if the audience doesn\u2019t buy the products, they enjoy the display. Oprah so enjoys shopping, not only for herself but for many other people, that her enthusiasm becomes infectious.  A serious subject that Oprah returns to periodically is bullying. In attempting to keep the different types of violence an ongoing subject for her audience, Oprah wanted to interview Jaycee Dugard, a young woman who had been kidnapped 18 years before being found alive. Although Oprah had made her \ufb01  rst ever attempt to tell a producer she wanted to interview the young woman, the family refused. Be-cause of that, he thought Oprah should have been more helpful to him. Finally, the message reached Oprah, who then barred the singer from her show. The transplant saved her, although her photographs reveal a woman whose face can never be considered 102 OPRAH WINFREYnormal. Vulnerability in children is a topic Oprah has returned to again and again.\u2019s, birthday, Oprah announced that she would undertake the topics of racism and the judicial system and race rela-tions. On all Oprah programs, advertising, which occurs every few minutes, consumes huge amounts of time. There are many women who not only look at merchandise on television but purchase articles Oprah recommends.  No matter the product, many affected companies have remarked on Oprah\u2019s extraordinary in\ufb02  uence on sales. Because of the con\ufb01  dence she has instilled in audiences, they will follow her recommendations, says the president of a branch of a publishing company, so that Oprah \u201ccre-ates markets all the time.\u201d When a show provided a demonstration by Art Smith, author of  Back to the Table  and Oprah\u2019s former chef, the presentation gave Oprah another opportunity to clown and do a bit of sashaying around as she proclaimed her love of potatoes. But as Oprah gives prices, she soft-ens the fact that she is advertising, humorously noting that she wants the discount being offered. Finding almost everything Oprah does to be manip-ulative, commercial, and self-serving, one disgruntled former employee of Harpo published a screed about the star on the Internet. Claiming that Oprah has business ties or a quid pro quo arrangement with many 106 OPRAH WINFREYcorporations, networks, and publishing houses, the writer calls her a world-class phony who is able to deliver audiences because her name sells everything, and companies are not interested in how she does that. A book called  Everybody Loves Oprah  quotes and names some hostile journalists. Bednarski of the  Chicago Sun-Times,  who wrote 20 years ago that Oprah was amoral about sexual matters and uninvolved with important moral and social issues. However, Oprah\u2019s appearance over the years\u2014her hairdos, makeup, jewelry, and clothing\u2014reveal her as savvy about her looks.  The frequency of exposure on television is also a major factor in selling a product or, as Oprah\u2019s boyfriend Stedman Graham labels everything, a brand: books, movies, political positions, and even the politicians who espouse the positions. An Indian writer, Shraddha Jahagirdar-Saxena, however, points to Oprah\u2019s ability to reach out to everyone\u2014that is, \u201cthe common man\u201d\u2014with issues that affect many, such as weight, abuse, and discrimination. Her most attention-getting book is  Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America,   but she has also written analytically about the entertainment business, describing Oprah\u2019s shows as a type of lesson delivered in the guise of entertainment.  Although not all talk shows nor their audiences are the same, Oprah\u2019s live audience generally is 80 percent white, middle class, and female, and they want to hear about the problems of other women, even though the guests may very well conform to a different social, cultural, or economic group than the viewers. 108 OPRAH WINFREY The harshest media critics \ufb01  nd two opposing characteristics in day-time television: one is as ampli\ufb01  er and manipulator of the conven-tional, the ordinary, and the bland, which projects accepted stereotypes rather than exploring the wide differences in human behavior. Take the example on Oprah\u2019s programs ad-dressing the issue of cross-dressing and gender change: a guest\u2019s lifetime struggle; relationships with parents and siblings, wife, children, and the outside world; decisions; and results are all explored within the limi-tations of a television hour.  Although  The Oprah Winfrey Show  brings in outside stars, often from the entertainment world, daytime programming seems to prefer every- MEDIA MOGUL 109day, average guests, whereas evening programs seek professionals. Almost without excep-tion, viewers speak affectionately and admiringly of Oprah. Some, who 110 OPRAH WINFREYfollow every story about her, talk as if a close relationship exists between them and the star. Former Harpo producer Coady describes reactions of audiences at shows: they cry when Oprah enters her television studio, gush when she speaks to them directly, and long to be touched. Journal-ists write of occasions when Oprah has left the stage to hug a member of the audience who has revealed a traumatic experience. Where some hosts hold a microphone while walking around, Oprah will sometimes sit in the audience and, on occasion speak with a few people during the break. Gen-erally with only a week to prepare each show, the producer is much  MEDIA MOGUL 111like a newsperson working in a noisy of\ufb01  ce \ufb01  lled with every imagin-able type of research \ufb01  le and publication. All of this is true of  The Oprah Winfrey Show.   The audience at an Oprah show only appears to be selected at ran-dom.  While guests wait until their names are called for admission to the studio, they are free to visit a gift shop that surprisingly (at least dur-ing Whitbourne\u2019s visit) sells almost no Oprah memorabilia. Cars are but one of 112 OPRAH WINFREYthe items audiences have been gifted with. Over the years, Oprah has given away UGG boots to her staff as presents and also made them a must-have item for many others; Apple iPods; books galore; and shop-ping carts \ufb01  lled with products from sponsors.)  Gifts vary in cost and value, but one of Oprah\u2019s \u201cfavorite things\u201d to give away was a refrigerator that had a built-in television set and radio. Oprah wanted the audience to experience the feeling she has\u2014that gift giving is a source of happiness.

Similar to the framing of the race series, a number of Oprah Winfrey program subjects are topical matters that have been discussed in other media. After leaks and ongoing speculation among television speakers and watchers, Oprah tearfully announced she was going to bring her net-work talk show to an end early in 2011.

T wo well-known people whose positions 116 OPRAH WINFREYon almost everything are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Oprah have been mentioned as possible replacements for Oprah.\u201d After all, Oprah is leaving the pro-gram by choice and nothing else. A poll taken by the  Chicago Sun-Times   found, after Oprah\u2019s announcement of future change, that she remains America\u2019s favorite TV personality. Janice Peck, \u201cTalk about Racism: Framing a Popular Discourse of Race on  Oprah Winfrey, \u201d  Cultural Critique  (Spring 1994).", "Bipolar_Disorder_2009": " Although the matter of mental health makes many people skittish and often is a taboo topic in families and organizations, early on, Oprah devoted several programs to exploring and explaining bipo-lar disorder.  At one time, Benard asked the writers of his show to portray his char-acter as a person with bipolar disorder, but their acquiescence resulted in his becoming ill after playing the role for several months.  An entirely different perspective on the sickness came from a fam-ily consisting of a man with bipolar disorder, his mother, and his wife of three years. The mother describes her son as having been normal until he reached his teens, at which time he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  A guest on several programs was Kay Jamison, who is a psychologist on the mental health staff at Johns Hopkins University, is well known for her work on bipolar disorder, and has written several books about the illness. The signi\ufb01  cance of her presence comes also from her life: she was diagnosed in her youth with bipolar disorder. For example, rage often is a component of bipolar illness, yet some people are able to hide their illness, as one of Oprah\u2019s guests told of disguising her sickness for a number of years; even after being given her diagnosis, she refused to take medicine, until \ufb01  nally the rages could no longer be contained.", "Subject_Matter_2009": "", "Book_Club_2002": "  Chapter 4  AMERICA READS  Always looking for ways to maintain the attention and involvement of her audience, and with an eye on ratings, Oprah and company intro-duced what was, at the time, a novel idea: a monthly television book club. At the beginning, every month, (except in summer) a book title would be announced, although there would be no regular day that the club would be on the program. Between 2000 and 2009, 36 books were assigned for club readers, but each year had a different number of books. In the \ufb01  rst year of the club, there were nine readings, but, by 2009, only one book was on the list:  Say You\u2019re One of Them,  a prize-winning collection of African short stories by a Nigerian priest, Uwem Akpan, who studied writing in the United States. reading of the book. On a Friday show (often a day when an-nouncements are made that don\u2019t make the news), she informed the audience that the novel  Sula  would be the last book chosen for the club. Although the demise of the club unquestionably was a great disappointment to many writers who wanted to be chosen, it meant much more to the publishers who had made many millions from the sales.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest.\u201d Keller con-siders Franzen\u2019s  The Corrections  so important in transforming \u201cliterary culture in 2000\u20132009,\u201d because it \u201cmade her book club controversial\u201d and U. Keller is not alone in her view that the book club has been an \u201castonishing cultural force.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club.\u201d There was speculation about whether her decision would bring the same kind of joy as her announcement several years ago of the formation of the original book club. Would the new book club take the place of the classroom and, if so, how.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall. Although there has been much wavering about the matter, it   appears that there will be no book club in the world of OWN. Some years had only a single book. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Because there are other works being considered, it may be that various types of movies will replace the book club. Nothing came of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s plans for a book club, however. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show. (Although illness and health are not usually the focus of plots in book club choices, the books also frequently seem to have links in their subject matter; reviewers some-times suggest that certain novels would be good choices for the club because they are depressing and/or painful.

Oprah would chose a book she\u2019d read and enjoyed, then announce the title on the air; a program with the author\u2019s appearance would follow; and, \ufb01  nally, a group of diverse, carefully picked, packaged, and screened readers would discuss the book.

A June 5, 2009, article in the  New York Times  (with no attribution to a particular author) examines both Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah  and Oprah\u2019s in-\ufb02 uence on her book club members. Quoting Peck, the reviewer writes that the club has elevated Oprah \u201cto the status of cultural icon,\u201d an expert who \u201ctells people what to read,\u201d the \u201clessons\u201d to be learned, and the \u201cquestions to ask.\u201d Furthermore, says the reviewer, Oprah\u2019s chosen commentators are expected to \u201cagree with her . Although the reviewer \ufb01  nds both the show and Oprah\u2019s approach to books \u201csentimental, shallow and manipulative,\u201d the effect on the audience is powerful; it places Oprah \u201cas the savior of women from themselves,\u201d and, incidentally, makes Oprah and the publishing industry large amounts of money. Peck has pointed to a notable dif-ference between the lessons Oprah imparts and those of classrooms: Oprah is concerned with self-discovery and wants the focus to be on lessons learned about oneself, whereas university classroom instruction tends to focus on separating the self from the work and therefore main-taining objectivity.  Linton Weeks, in the  Washington Post,  called Oprah\u2019s choice of books the equivalent of hitting the lottery for writers, but that same descrip-tion has obviously held true for publishers. 1  Throughout the country, bookstores large and small, knowing the effect of Oprah\u2019s pronounce-ments, immediately stocked numerous copies of the recommended book.  Publishers Weekly  backed up the data of Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence with the claim that hardcover and paperback books could not get onto best-seller lists unless readers knew the author\u2019s previous work or were an Oprah pick. 2   Oprah\u2019s choices are always available in paperback and thus available to a larger number of readers. Once her book club became a reality, a browser or reader going into any bookstore and numerous coffee shops  AMERICA READS 119could not fail to see a special display, shelf, or bookcase, given over to \u201cAn Oprah Selection.\u201d Her chosen books even had an imprint to that effect. Only a year after the introduction of the book club,  Newsweek,  along with other magazines, labeled her the most signi\ufb01  cant person in the modern book world, and one  Newsweek  writer, in reviewing a thriller, had words of advice for publishers about turning their books into best-sellers: \u201cpray for an act of God. or Oprah.\u201d Inspirational books, even if not chosen for Oprah\u2019s club, became very popular as a result of exposure on her show, particularly after the events of 9/11. Not only did his \ufb01  rst book become a best-seller, but after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, the child signed a \ufb01  ve-book contract. Oprah called him inspirational, a \u201cfriend,\u201d and \u201can angel on earth.\u201d When a Maryland park and statue were dedicated to the boy\u2019s memory, Oprah was in the group of celebrants.  Not everyone had liked Oprah\u2019s pushing the young poet\u2019s work.\u201d Elder, publishers, and Oprah are not the only people involved with books who have discovered the value of sentimentality: author Tom Clancy earlier gained considerable publicity for several years when he wrote and talked about his deep affection for the af\ufb02  icted child and had dedicated a novel to him. 3   Writer David Streitfeld (then on staff at the  Washington Post ) was one of the few writers who found Oprah\u2019s efforts commendable in urg-ing people to read and compared her effectiveness in getting people interested in books to that of 19th-century tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who, among his other deeds, endowed 2,500 librar-ies. But a  Washington Post  colleague of Streitfeld\u2019s, Amy Schwartz, was not as fulsome with her praise, raising the possibility that Oprah was simply harvesting the returns of a recent national revival of reading. 4  Nonetheless, so in\ufb02  uential was Oprah considered in her effect on na-tional reading habits that, in 1999, the National Book Foundation, at an elegant black-tie affair hosted by actor Steve Martin, presented Oprah with its 50th anniversary gold medal. Even a decade later, Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence on reading has remained signi\ufb01  cant. Hers has been 120 OPRAH WINFREYthe largest book club in the world\u2014ever.\u201d 5  However, the books are for sale, and most importantly the book-sellers order whatever Oprah recommends, knowing that there will be a huge readership for the product.  Accepting the medal from the foundation, Oprah spoke of the para-mount role books had played in her life. She said that books have always been its most pleasurable part. They\u2019ve also helped her to learn about herself and the world. At that point, she began to understand the force of writers and their books.  Yet, despite her passion for the written word and after several years of praise for her effect on the publishing industry and the reading pub-lic\u2019s increased interest in books, Oprah, who had been nicknamed the \u201cqueen bee of book clubs,\u201d suddenly decided to abandon the club as part of her television program. On a Friday show (often a day when an-nouncements are made that don\u2019t make the news), she informed the audience that the novel  Sula  would be the last book chosen for the club. She announced, in a statement that would provoke criticism, that she no longer could \ufb01  nd interesting books to read, introduce, and discuss on her program. Although Oprah did not tell the audience of other fac-tors in her decision, there was more to the matter than lack of worthy books.  Regardless of the huge number of books sold, from 600,000 to a mil-lion new copies per book, a market survey revealed only a limited view-ing audience for the television discussion of books, considerably less than those who watch Oprah\u2019s regular daily programs. The shows about books became less frequent over the years. Also, reportedly, sales of books were beginning to \ufb02  atten (though Oprah\u2019s picks con- AMERICA READS 121tinued to sell more than other works). Meanwhile, an \u201cinside source\u201d leaked the somewhat curious disclosure that the task of screening one book per month was exhausting for Oprah and her staff, \u201cthe single hardest thing that had to be done for the television program.\u201d If so, it is surprising that Oprah continuously refers to books she is reading or has read. Friends claim that she prefers reading to television, and an issue of her now-defunct magazine  O At Home  contains a lengthy article with photos about her books and library in her California house.  Some of the publishing companies sturdily supported Oprah\u2019s deci-sion publicly\u2014after all, how could they do otherwise, given the im-portant \ufb01  nancial boost she\u2019d made to the industry. Random House put a full-page \u201cThank you, Oprah\u201d in the April 12, 2002, edition of the  New York Times.  The company expressed gratitude for the years of work she\u2019d devoted to \u201cbooks, authors, and readers. As Carlin Romano of the  Philadelphia Inquirer  pointed out, the \ufb01  nal book Oprah picked,  Sula,  had been written 28 years earlier by Toni Morrison, one of four Morrison novels Oprah had chosen. Romano\u2019s piece turned more derisive with the comment that anyone as rich as Oprah could certainly give up the arduous task of a monthly book selection and take an easier road for her program \u201clike talking between commercials or serving in the  Israeli Defense Forces. \u201d 6  Crit-ics also pointed out that more variety might prove more palatable to readers as well as reviewers, some of whom found the Oprah selections excessively restrictive\u2014that is, with a sameness from one work to another.  Although fans continued to associate Oprah with books, a num-ber of negative statements were made about her choices. Critic Carol Muller listed a series of \u201cOprah topics\u201d that she found in books she was 122 OPRAH WINFREYreviewing. Those topics were listed without comment as possible themes for Oprah\u2019s programs and for articles in Oprah\u2019s magazine: lesbianism, abuse, osteoporosis, devotion, retardation, and a crisis of faith. Such ad-verse judgments about Oprah\u2019s subject matter are related to various ear-lier deprecatory reviews by others, criticizing many of Oprah\u2019s choices as focusing on dysfunctional people. For instance,  Wall Street Journal  writer Cynthia Crossen might have been speaking for various review-ers in stating that the reach of Oprah\u2019s book selections went from \u201cA (abused) to B (battered). Another reviewer, Robert Clark, suggested that the term \u201cwoman\u2019s novel\u201d should be dropped for her choices, and \u201cthe Oprah novel\u201d should be substituted because her selections have the same formula.  The excuse given for  The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2019s abandonment of the book club had numerous people wondering about Oprah\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Other book clubs have since been launched; one in particular in Britain, seeking what is known as \u201cthe Oprah effect,\u201d has been touted as bringing in a \u201cwhole new generation of literary superstars. Titled \u201cOut of the Gene Pool,\u201d the strip had Oprah speaking of the boredom she had felt in reading while she ate her lunch; no lon-ger interested in the book, she put a carrot in her nose; that experience, which she describes as \u201cspiritual,\u201d provides \u201crebirth.\u201d  The cartoonist, making fun not only of Oprah\u2019s loss of interest in books but also of her television persona, satirizes both the star and the audience. Oprah\u2019s renewal comes from a vegetable, not from some clever or brilliant thesis or work of art. Newspaper reports tell of many thousands of women who also want to thrust carrots up their noses and experience what Oprah did, so that they overrun grocery stores and hospitals and bring about a surge in the stock market.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest. Did the majority of readers like her choice of books. Oprah\u2019s good friend, writer Maya Angelou, weighed in, stating that she didn\u2019t agree with all the choices, but reading is what matters. Consid-ering the vast amount of publicity given to the dustup Oprah and com-pany had with one of the novelists, Jonathan Franzen, shortly before the decision to give up the book segment of the program, interest in the book selections (among readers, nonreaders, and, in fact, general interest throughout the country) was aroused to a pitch not enjoyed before and could only have served to swell the numbers of the show\u2019s audience.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. Because of a public brou-haha with Oprah, Franzen became the most-written-about writer of that 124 OPRAH WINFREYyear. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership. In several columns, Yardley reaf\ufb01  rms his belief that Oprah genuinely champions books, but he also hastens to inform readers of his thorough dislike of her television program.\u201d  Book critics have noted that all books anointed by Oprah become best-sellers, bringing in millions of dollars to the author and, of course, the publishing industry. His own book, said Franzen, is in the high art tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to be known as an Oprah Book Club choice.  Sides in the con\ufb02  ict were chosen, but far more were and are on Oprah\u2019s team.\u201d  It is surprising that the Oprah producers in their background checks of participants in their programs overlooked Franzen\u2019s essays and his hostile statements about the shamelessness of television. When, in 2010, Franzen published another novel,  Free-dom,  which achieved notoriety almost before publication, Oprah and Franzen reconciled.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club. For a number of years, Oprah also selected non\ufb01  ction publications for themes on her program. The fact is that Oprah\u2019s viewers and readers, in and outside of the studio, have been primarily women.  One tenet of many of these programs, and stressed also through the club\u2014is an Oprah mantra: everyone, male and female, young and old, has to learn for herself or himself that our lives are in our own hands. We cannot bypass either hurtful situations or the person who causes suffering; the person who has given us pain or made us angry, accord-ing to Oprah, must be made aware of the issue. The subject, as in the lessons of the books, is one that resonates in many, many speeches and interviews that Oprah gives, re\ufb02  ecting her own learning curve over the years.  By urging girls and women to refrain from expressing anger or ag-gressiveness, Oprah, in her choice of books, and the numerous pundits on her show point out that our culture has always taught dishonesty; it is behavior that must change.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club. Like almost every act of Oprah\u2019s, it made 126 OPRAH WINFREYnewspaper headlines in both the hard news sections and in the style and entertainment segments of many papers. But lest she would have to proclaim that she\u2019d found current books alright, worthy of reading and discussing, she was going to rediscover (or perhaps discover) the classics. While being honored with a standing ovation for all she had previously done to inspire an interest in current books, she told the Association of American Publishers she would be returning to the recommendation of books, \u201cbut with a difference. Would the return to classics\u2014in the way that Oprah\u2019s other programs have stimulated viewers\u2014lead to a renewal of interest in literature and literary degrees in colleges and universities. Hitchens also recommended George Eliot\u2019s novel  Middlemarch  as particularly appropriate for Oprah\u2019s show. The novel, which tells of the sexual and intellectual frustrations of an unhappily married Victorian woman, is one that, he believes, offers endless pos-sibilities for Oprah\u2019s program. And Oprah has chosen a number of them.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall. Oprah described the book as \u201ca spiritual autobi-ography,\u201d an apt term for a work that reports on faith, race, and the in\ufb02 uence of great leaders such as Mandela and Gandhi.   It seemed for a time the classics would later have a revived chance for sales with Oprah\u2019s new club undertaking, even if the authors are dead. A world-famous star with Oprah\u2019s international follow-ing can have a major impact on the rejuvenation of reading. When Oprah made the promised announcement of a newly revived book club, stores immediately were deluged by sales.  Oprah soon gave up on the classics and returned to more contem-porary books, which appear to have little or no relationship to each other. Whether Oprah herself chooses the books or members of her staff do so is not made public. Some novelists appear to be favorites; for example, Faulkner\u2019s books have been chosen three times (a some-what surprising choice given that college students\u2014even literature 128 OPRAH WINFREYmajors\u2014are known to need assistance with his works). However, it isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah favors novels of the South. In the mix of choices are some philosophic/religious/spiritual works that surely would not have become best-sellers without the Winfrey imprimatur.  When Oprah resumed the program with her book club, publishers continued to be thrilled with its enormous impact on her following, knowing they\u2014the publishers\u2014had the equivalent of the baseball \ufb01  eld story: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d  But with Oprah\u2019s announcement a few years later that she would be giving up her daily show on network television, gloom reigns today in the publishing industry. Several newspapers have stated openly that Oprah\u2019s \u201cbig switch\u201d will not only change afternoon television but also that book publishers are facing \u201cdoom.  Keeping track of Oprah\u2019s wishes about her book club can be dizzy-ing for her reading followers.\u201d 7   A complete list of the 36 newer choices on Oprah\u2019s soon-to-be-extinct book club books might be compared to an electrocardiogram, as the lines go up and down. Some years had only a single book. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Oprah\u2019s favorites were included, as were recommendations from experts in the \ufb01  eld of children\u2019s literature.  One writer, unaf\ufb01  liated with any of Oprah\u2019s undertakings, decided that Oprah herself would make a good subject for a children\u2019s book. Called  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weatherford, the trade journal  Publishers Weekly  listed it along with reviews of other chil-dren\u2019s books.\u201d 8   As in the past, some Oprah book choices have made it to the big screen, and Oprah intends to continue that practice. Even though Oprah will be giving up the book club when she leaves her show, her publication,  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which has been an outstanding success, will continue.  Three publications, called \u201cvanity magazines\u201d by  Washington Post  food writer Candy Saigon, dominated the women\u2019s market for several years: those of Martha Stewart ( Martha Stewart Living ) ,  Oprah Winfrey ( O, The Oprah Magazine ), and Rosie O\u2019Donnell ( Rosie ). Although everyone eagerly awaited the \ufb01  rst of these, Martha Stewart\u2019s  Living,  Oprah\u2019s magazine has been more popular from the beginning. The failure rate for start-ups in maga-zines is extremely high; even Oprah\u2019s second venture into magazine publishing,  Oprah At Home,  also came to an end.  Like Oprah, O\u2019Donnell began as a television star. She also de-parted from magazine publishing in September 2002. She was famous, funny, and popular, and she showed  AMERICA READS 131some of the same personality traits of both Oprah and Stewart: strength and determination and staying power with audiences.  For a short period of time, the two stars, O\u2019Donnell and Oprah, seemed to be almost in lockstep: television, magazines, and even books for readers. O\u2019Donnell, though, limited her picks to children\u2019s books and even announced it before her decision to leave her long-running show. Then, after years of being circumspect about her private affairs, O\u2019Donnell went public with her autobiography,  Find Me,  a book that opened the closet door. Her tell-all book had preceded by a month her exiting her television show. 134 OPRAH WINFREY Famous names are expected to sell products and magazines. Signi\ufb01  cantly, despite the fact that advertising is up, news reports have also pointed to somewhat poorer circulation for Oprah\u2019s magazine, which has never been touched by scandals of any sort. Neither Stewart\u2019s nor O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, however, seem to have offered much of a challenge to Oprah\u2019s, even though there was no apparent difference to be found on the magazine racks in stores, inasmuch as some of the largest grocery chains stocked both Stewart\u2019s and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, sometimes one or the other, but, inexplicably, not Oprah\u2019s for a long time.  Oprah has been a huge factor in the sale of books, a boon to writ-ers, publishers, and bookstores, and even to discount and department stores such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and Target, all better known for food items and other merchandise. A large number of book stores carry her magazine, but most discount stores do not. Even though some stores did not publicize Oprah\u2019s book choices by distinguishing them from other books, most book stores contained separate racks of Oprah\u2019s book selec-tions. 9  Although those early books are no longer featured, the ones that remained in print still carried the sticker an-nouncing them as an Oprah choice, and once Oprah came back to the business of touting books, no matter the subject, logos and sales went up. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show.  Like her television programs and her book clubs\u2014with their enor-mous effect on sales\u2014Oprah\u2019s magazine has been described by writer Patricia Sellers of  Fortune  as \u201cthe most successful magazine launch ever. At a time when other longtime popular women\u2019s magazines have failed,  O, The Oprah Magazine  continues to attract a signi\ufb01  cantly large number of new readers. According to Gayle King, editor-at-large of the magazine, Oprah is obsessive about  O,  overseeing everything, even \u201ccommas\u201d and \u201cexclamation points,\u201d and numerous people have told of the amount of time and work she puts into it. Given the tight control of all Oprah operations, the likelihood 136 OPRAH WINFREYis that further information will not be provided. Clearly, it is Oprah\u2019s magazine, and at times she seems ubiquitous. Fol-lowing Oprah\u2019s opening essay, \u201cHere We Go,\u201d is an attractive calen-dar for the month, with photographs appropriate to the season.    Each issue of the magazine offers advice of many kinds, much of it in Oprah\u2019s pieces, as well as in the regular monthly columns, and in articles by specialists on a particular subject. Most of the problems of life \ufb01  nd their way eventually onto the beautiful glossy spread, which features a photo of Oprah on the cover as well as an impressive number inside. And, when a particularly beautiful picture of Oprah appears in newspapers and other magazines, it also is printed in  O.  Over a period of several years, through photos alone, a reader may gain insight about the star\u2019s preferences in clothing, from  AMERICA READS 137 Oprah Winfrey stands in front of the cover of the premiere issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine , at a press breakfast in New York, April 17, 2000.  When Oprah was asked why only her picture appears on every cover, her answer was somewhat ingenuous; it was to avoid the neces-sity of making choices of other people every month. In addition to the many pictures of Oprah inside the magazine, the photos are generally of celebrities\u2014perhaps alongside a brief article by or about them. And, although a great many of the arti-cles are about serious matters, there are occasional ones about pleasure, with descriptions and photos of parties Oprah has given. The table settings and linens may be like the products that the star recom-mends in every issue with its soft selling style in the magazine and on 138 OPRAH WINFREYtelevision.  Among the monthly articles, Oprah\u2019s \u201cHere We Go\u201d column in-troduces the theme treated in the majority of articles, most written by women and for women. The view held by readers of Oprah as a woman not only of wisdom but also tenderheartedness underlies advertisements as well as articles.  Every issue features an interview in which Oprah talks to someone famous or important to her, people she knows well or only through rep-utation, but generally those she admires. Some of the interviews have special interest for women, such as the one Oprah had at the home of Elizabeth Edwards when she had just written a book and appeared on the television program but before all the unsavory facts came out about her husband. On occasion, the interviews provide insight into Oprah herself. Oprah always credits her friends for the help they have given her in good times and bad. However, Oprah would undoubt-edly say it is almost impossible to fend off the press\u2014both reporters and television commentators\u2014who search out scandals.\u201d (The Youngs were guests on Oprah\u2019s show, during which Oprah pointedly revealed distaste for the entire matter. When Edwards\u2019s mistress and mother of his child Rielle Hunter was questioned by reporters about revealing photographs and a story in a magazine\u2014not  O, The Oprah Magazine \u2014she was critical of Oprah and her \u201cbelief systems about sex.\u201d In the back-and-forth stories that have been printed, it seems as though only Oprah escapes with her dignity intact.) Later, Oprah had Hunter on the show as a guest, although, to date, Hunter has not written a book. Illness and health are frequent subjects in  O,  and when some particular spark catches the attention of the public, Oprah interviews for the magazine unusual people whose strength and willpower in the face of a ravaging disease inspires others. Inasmuch as it seems the entire world watches Oprah\u2019s weight,  O  provides a forum to reveal her successes and failures, just as she has on her shows for years. (Perhaps this should be part of Oprah\u2019s admonition not to give away your power.)  Beauty, health, and style articles appear in every issue, as well as a monthly self-help piece by Oprah called \u201cSomething to Think About.\u201d 140 OPRAH WINFREYThis turns into a written exercise with the listing of numerous questions that need to be answered by the reader in the spaces provided.  More and more often in recent years, Oprah has written of events from her childhood, remembering her grandmother, who, despite her harshness and rigidity, communicated unspoken affection to the little girl through small actions. After years of trauma in several relationships, Oprah began to recognize the gifts her grandmother gave her.  Oprah is a sharer, which is different from relinquishing control.  At various times, Oprah has spoken of her own traumatic introduc-tion to sex. Although what Oprah tells the reader about her early life is no longer new, she identi\ufb01  es with those troubling points underlying teenage sex: the failure of parents to communicate with children, the distances between them, the need girls have for love and acceptance, and the pervasive unhappiness and self-blame resulting from sexual ac-tivities. The fact that Oprah is now middle aged and has dealt with the anguish of her experiences long ago does not alter the similarities  AMERICA READS 141of root causes. In an almost a Words-worthian view, Oprah writes that one must not grieve for what is not given, but take another path. Central messages such as these account for the affection and trust of women worldwide and undoubtedly will continue to be important in the time remaining for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  the ongoing  O  magazine, and other Oprah undertakings. \u201cThe Oprah Effect,\u201d  Publishers Weekly,  Oct.

Oprah would chose a book she\u2019d read and enjoyed, then announce the title on the air; a program with the author\u2019s appearance would follow; and, \ufb01  nally, a group of diverse, carefully picked, packaged, and screened readers would discuss the book.\u201d With the usual declarations, hype, and advertising, the club was born 118 OPRAH WINFREYin televisionland, in 1996, when the \ufb01  rst book discussion took place, about Jacquelyn Mitchard\u2019s  The Deep End of the Ocean.   From the beginning, every book chosen by Oprah became a best-seller and an exceptional boon to the publishing industry. A June 5, 2009, article in the  New York Times  (with no attribution to a particular author) examines both Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah  and Oprah\u2019s in-\ufb02 uence on her book club members. Quoting Peck, the reviewer writes that the club has elevated Oprah \u201cto the status of cultural icon,\u201d an expert who \u201ctells people what to read,\u201d the \u201clessons\u201d to be learned, and the \u201cquestions to ask.\u201d Furthermore, says the reviewer, Oprah\u2019s chosen commentators are expected to \u201cagree with her . Although the reviewer \ufb01  nds both the show and Oprah\u2019s approach to books \u201csentimental, shallow and manipulative,\u201d the effect on the audience is powerful; it places Oprah \u201cas the savior of women from themselves,\u201d and, incidentally, makes Oprah and the publishing industry large amounts of money. Peck has pointed to a notable dif-ference between the lessons Oprah imparts and those of classrooms: Oprah is concerned with self-discovery and wants the focus to be on lessons learned about oneself, whereas university classroom instruction tends to focus on separating the self from the work and therefore main-taining objectivity.  Linton Weeks, in the  Washington Post,  called Oprah\u2019s choice of books the equivalent of hitting the lottery for writers, but that same descrip-tion has obviously held true for publishers. 1  Throughout the country, bookstores large and small, knowing the effect of Oprah\u2019s pronounce-ments, immediately stocked numerous copies of the recommended book.  Publishers Weekly  backed up the data of Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence with the claim that hardcover and paperback books could not get onto best-seller lists unless readers knew the author\u2019s previous work or were an Oprah pick. 2   Oprah\u2019s choices are always available in paperback and thus available to a larger number of readers. Once her book club became a reality, a browser or reader going into any bookstore and numerous coffee shops  AMERICA READS 119could not fail to see a special display, shelf, or bookcase, given over to \u201cAn Oprah Selection.\u201d Her chosen books even had an imprint to that effect. Only a year after the introduction of the book club,  Newsweek,  along with other magazines, labeled her the most signi\ufb01  cant person in the modern book world, and one  Newsweek  writer, in reviewing a thriller, had words of advice for publishers about turning their books into best-sellers: \u201cpray for an act of God. or Oprah.\u201d Inspirational books, even if not chosen for Oprah\u2019s club, became very popular as a result of exposure on her show, particularly after the events of 9/11. Not only did his \ufb01  rst book become a best-seller, but after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, the child signed a \ufb01  ve-book contract. Oprah called him inspirational, a \u201cfriend,\u201d and \u201can angel on earth.\u201d When a Maryland park and statue were dedicated to the boy\u2019s memory, Oprah was in the group of celebrants.  Not everyone had liked Oprah\u2019s pushing the young poet\u2019s work.\u201d Elder, publishers, and Oprah are not the only people involved with books who have discovered the value of sentimentality: author Tom Clancy earlier gained considerable publicity for several years when he wrote and talked about his deep affection for the af\ufb02  icted child and had dedicated a novel to him. 3   Writer David Streitfeld (then on staff at the  Washington Post ) was one of the few writers who found Oprah\u2019s efforts commendable in urg-ing people to read and compared her effectiveness in getting people interested in books to that of 19th-century tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who, among his other deeds, endowed 2,500 librar-ies. But a  Washington Post  colleague of Streitfeld\u2019s, Amy Schwartz, was not as fulsome with her praise, raising the possibility that Oprah was simply harvesting the returns of a recent national revival of reading. 4  Nonetheless, so in\ufb02  uential was Oprah considered in her effect on na-tional reading habits that, in 1999, the National Book Foundation, at an elegant black-tie affair hosted by actor Steve Martin, presented Oprah with its 50th anniversary gold medal. Even a decade later, Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence on reading has remained signi\ufb01  cant. Hers has been 120 OPRAH WINFREYthe largest book club in the world\u2014ever.\u201d 5  However, the books are for sale, and most importantly the book-sellers order whatever Oprah recommends, knowing that there will be a huge readership for the product.  Accepting the medal from the foundation, Oprah spoke of the para-mount role books had played in her life. She said that books have always been its most pleasurable part.  Yet, despite her passion for the written word and after several years of praise for her effect on the publishing industry and the reading pub-lic\u2019s increased interest in books, Oprah, who had been nicknamed the \u201cqueen bee of book clubs,\u201d suddenly decided to abandon the club as part of her television program. On a Friday show (often a day when an-nouncements are made that don\u2019t make the news), she informed the audience that the novel  Sula  would be the last book chosen for the club. She announced, in a statement that would provoke criticism, that she no longer could \ufb01  nd interesting books to read, introduce, and discuss on her program. Although Oprah did not tell the audience of other fac-tors in her decision, there was more to the matter than lack of worthy books.  Regardless of the huge number of books sold, from 600,000 to a mil-lion new copies per book, a market survey revealed only a limited view-ing audience for the television discussion of books, considerably less than those who watch Oprah\u2019s regular daily programs. Also, reportedly, sales of books were beginning to \ufb02  atten (though Oprah\u2019s picks con- AMERICA READS 121tinued to sell more than other works). Meanwhile, an \u201cinside source\u201d leaked the somewhat curious disclosure that the task of screening one book per month was exhausting for Oprah and her staff, \u201cthe single hardest thing that had to be done for the television program.\u201d If so, it is surprising that Oprah continuously refers to books she is reading or has read. Friends claim that she prefers reading to television, and an issue of her now-defunct magazine  O At Home  contains a lengthy article with photos about her books and library in her California house.  Some of the publishing companies sturdily supported Oprah\u2019s deci-sion publicly\u2014after all, how could they do otherwise, given the im-portant \ufb01  nancial boost she\u2019d made to the industry. Random House put a full-page \u201cThank you, Oprah\u201d in the April 12, 2002, edition of the  New York Times.  The company expressed gratitude for the years of work she\u2019d devoted to \u201cbooks, authors, and readers. As Carlin Romano of the  Philadelphia Inquirer  pointed out, the \ufb01  nal book Oprah picked,  Sula,  had been written 28 years earlier by Toni Morrison, one of four Morrison novels Oprah had chosen. Romano\u2019s piece turned more derisive with the comment that anyone as rich as Oprah could certainly give up the arduous task of a monthly book selection and take an easier road for her program \u201clike talking between commercials or serving in the  Israeli Defense Forces. \u201d 6  Crit-ics also pointed out that more variety might prove more palatable to readers as well as reviewers, some of whom found the Oprah selections excessively restrictive\u2014that is, with a sameness from one work to another.  Although fans continued to associate Oprah with books, a num-ber of negative statements were made about her choices. Critic Carol Muller listed a series of \u201cOprah topics\u201d that she found in books she was 122 OPRAH WINFREYreviewing. Those topics were listed without comment as possible themes for Oprah\u2019s programs and for articles in Oprah\u2019s magazine: lesbianism, abuse, osteoporosis, devotion, retardation, and a crisis of faith. Such ad-verse judgments about Oprah\u2019s subject matter are related to various ear-lier deprecatory reviews by others, criticizing many of Oprah\u2019s choices as focusing on dysfunctional people. For instance,  Wall Street Journal  writer Cynthia Crossen might have been speaking for various review-ers in stating that the reach of Oprah\u2019s book selections went from \u201cA (abused) to B (battered). Another reviewer, Robert Clark, suggested that the term \u201cwoman\u2019s novel\u201d should be dropped for her choices, and \u201cthe Oprah novel\u201d should be substituted because her selections have the same formula.  The excuse given for  The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2019s abandonment of the book club had numerous people wondering about Oprah\u2019s judgment. There was humor as well: columnist Ben Crandell, writing in one of his \u201cSouth Beach\u201d re-ports in the  Sun Sentinel  in April 2002, headlined it as \u201cOprah\u2019s Shelved, So Others Must Pass on the Good Word.\u201d With strong, tongue-in-cheek language, he called Oprah\u2019s dismissal of the club \u201cBetrayal.\u201d (Other book clubs have since been launched; one in particular in Britain, seeking what is known as \u201cthe Oprah effect,\u201d has been touted as bringing in a \u201cwhole new generation of literary superstars.\u201d)  Another farcical illustration of the mileage gained from the clumsi-ness of Oprah\u2019s action appeared in a mocking comic strip drawn by Matt Janz. Titled \u201cOut of the Gene Pool,\u201d the strip had Oprah speaking of the boredom she had felt in reading while she ate her lunch; no lon-ger interested in the book, she put a carrot in her nose; that experience, which she describes as \u201cspiritual,\u201d provides \u201crebirth.\u201d  The cartoonist, making fun not only of Oprah\u2019s loss of interest in books but also of her television persona, satirizes both the star and the audience. Oprah\u2019s renewal comes from a vegetable, not from some clever or brilliant thesis or work of art. Newspaper reports tell of many thousands of women who also want to thrust carrots up their noses and experience what Oprah did, so that they overrun grocery stores and hospitals and bring about a surge in the stock market.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest. Did the majority of readers like her choice of books. Oprah\u2019s good friend, writer Maya Angelou, weighed in, stating that she didn\u2019t agree with all the choices, but reading is what matters. Consid-ering the vast amount of publicity given to the dustup Oprah and com-pany had with one of the novelists, Jonathan Franzen, shortly before the decision to give up the book segment of the program, interest in the book selections (among readers, nonreaders, and, in fact, general interest throughout the country) was aroused to a pitch not enjoyed before and could only have served to swell the numbers of the show\u2019s audience.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. Because of a public brou-haha with Oprah, Franzen became the most-written-about writer of that 124 OPRAH WINFREYyear. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership. In several columns, Yardley reaf\ufb01  rms his belief that Oprah genuinely champions books, but he also hastens to inform readers of his thorough dislike of her television program.\u201d  Book critics have noted that all books anointed by Oprah become best-sellers, bringing in millions of dollars to the author and, of course, the publishing industry. His own book, said Franzen, is in the high art tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to be known as an Oprah Book Club choice.  Sides in the con\ufb02  ict were chosen, but far more were and are on Oprah\u2019s team.\u201d  It is surprising that the Oprah producers in their background checks of participants in their programs overlooked Franzen\u2019s essays and his hostile statements about the shamelessness of television. When, in 2010, Franzen published another novel,  Free-dom,  which achieved notoriety almost before publication, Oprah and Franzen reconciled.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club. For a number of years, Oprah also selected non\ufb01  ction publications for themes on her program. The fact is that Oprah\u2019s viewers and readers, in and outside of the studio, have been primarily women.  One tenet of many of these programs, and stressed also through the club\u2014is an Oprah mantra: everyone, male and female, young and old, has to learn for herself or himself that our lives are in our own hands. We cannot bypass either hurtful situations or the person who causes suffering; the person who has given us pain or made us angry, accord-ing to Oprah, must be made aware of the issue. The subject, as in the lessons of the books, is one that resonates in many, many speeches and interviews that Oprah gives, re\ufb02  ecting her own learning curve over the years.  By urging girls and women to refrain from expressing anger or ag-gressiveness, Oprah, in her choice of books, and the numerous pundits on her show point out that our culture has always taught dishonesty; it is behavior that must change.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club. Like almost every act of Oprah\u2019s, it made 126 OPRAH WINFREYnewspaper headlines in both the hard news sections and in the style and entertainment segments of many papers. But lest she would have to proclaim that she\u2019d found current books alright, worthy of reading and discussing, she was going to rediscover (or perhaps discover) the classics. While being honored with a standing ovation for all she had previously done to inspire an interest in current books, she told the Association of American Publishers she would be returning to the recommendation of books, \u201cbut with a difference. Would the return to classics\u2014in the way that Oprah\u2019s other programs have stimulated viewers\u2014lead to a renewal of interest in literature and literary degrees in colleges and universities. When he told a group of high school students that she should consider a discussion of Tolstoy\u2019s  Anna Karenina,  he playfully put forth the idea that it could provide material for a long, long time for Oprah and her friend, psychologist Dr. Hitchens also recommended George Eliot\u2019s novel  Middlemarch  as particularly appropriate for Oprah\u2019s show. The novel, which tells of the sexual and intellectual frustrations of an unhappily married Victorian woman, is one that, he believes, offers endless pos-sibilities for Oprah\u2019s program. And Oprah has chosen a number of them.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall. Oprah described the book as \u201ca spiritual autobi-ography,\u201d an apt term for a work that reports on faith, race, and the in\ufb02 uence of great leaders such as Mandela and Gandhi. In talking on her show about the actor, Oprah called Poitier \u201cone of the greatest men .   It seemed for a time the classics would later have a revived chance for sales with Oprah\u2019s new club undertaking, even if the authors are dead. A world-famous star with Oprah\u2019s international follow-ing can have a major impact on the rejuvenation of reading. When Oprah made the promised announcement of a newly revived book club, stores immediately were deluged by sales.  Oprah soon gave up on the classics and returned to more contem-porary books, which appear to have little or no relationship to each other. Whether Oprah herself chooses the books or members of her staff do so is not made public. Some novelists appear to be favorites; for example, Faulkner\u2019s books have been chosen three times (a some-what surprising choice given that college students\u2014even literature 128 OPRAH WINFREYmajors\u2014are known to need assistance with his works). However, it isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah favors novels of the South. In the mix of choices are some philosophic/religious/spiritual works that surely would not have become best-sellers without the Winfrey imprimatur.  When Oprah resumed the program with her book club, publishers continued to be thrilled with its enormous impact on her following, knowing they\u2014the publishers\u2014had the equivalent of the baseball \ufb01  eld story: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d  But with Oprah\u2019s announcement a few years later that she would be giving up her daily show on network television, gloom reigns today in the publishing industry. Several newspapers have stated openly that Oprah\u2019s \u201cbig switch\u201d will not only change afternoon television but also that book publishers are facing \u201cdoom.  Keeping track of Oprah\u2019s wishes about her book club can be dizzy-ing for her reading followers.\u201d 7   A complete list of the 36 newer choices on Oprah\u2019s soon-to-be-extinct book club books might be compared to an electrocardiogram, as the lines go up and down. Some years had only a single book. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Oprah\u2019s favorites were included, as were recommendations from experts in the \ufb01  eld of children\u2019s literature.  One writer, unaf\ufb01  liated with any of Oprah\u2019s undertakings, decided that Oprah herself would make a good subject for a children\u2019s book. Called  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weatherford, the trade journal  Publishers Weekly  listed it along with reviews of other chil-dren\u2019s books.\u201d 8   As in the past, some Oprah book choices have made it to the big screen, and Oprah intends to continue that practice. Even while ready-ing herself for the major change to cable television, she and Tom Hanks announced plans to coproduce a movie based on an Oprah book pick,  The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. Even though Oprah will be giving up the book club when she leaves her show, her publication,  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which has been an outstanding success, will continue. The failure rate for start-ups in maga-zines is extremely high; even Oprah\u2019s second venture into magazine publishing,  Oprah At Home,  also came to an end.  Like Oprah, O\u2019Donnell began as a television star. She was famous, funny, and popular, and she showed  AMERICA READS 131some of the same personality traits of both Oprah and Stewart: strength and determination and staying power with audiences.  For a short period of time, the two stars, O\u2019Donnell and Oprah, seemed to be almost in lockstep: television, magazines, and even books for readers. O\u2019Donnell, though, limited her picks to children\u2019s books and even announced it before her decision to leave her long-running show. Then, after years of being circumspect about her private affairs, O\u2019Donnell went public with her autobiography,  Find Me,  a book that opened the closet door. Her tell-all book had preceded by a month her exiting her television show. 134 OPRAH WINFREY Famous names are expected to sell products and magazines. Signi\ufb01  cantly, despite the fact that advertising is up, news reports have also pointed to somewhat poorer circulation for Oprah\u2019s magazine, which has never been touched by scandals of any sort. Neither Stewart\u2019s nor O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, however, seem to have offered much of a challenge to Oprah\u2019s, even though there was no apparent difference to be found on the magazine racks in stores, inasmuch as some of the largest grocery chains stocked both Stewart\u2019s and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, sometimes one or the other, but, inexplicably, not Oprah\u2019s for a long time.  Oprah has been a huge factor in the sale of books, a boon to writ-ers, publishers, and bookstores, and even to discount and department stores such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and Target, all better known for food items and other merchandise. Even though some stores did not publicize Oprah\u2019s book choices by distinguishing them from other books, most book stores contained separate racks of Oprah\u2019s book selec-tions. 9  Although those early books are no longer featured, the ones that remained in print still carried the sticker an-nouncing them as an Oprah choice, and once Oprah came back to the business of touting books, no matter the subject, logos and sales went up. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show.  Like her television programs and her book clubs\u2014with their enor-mous effect on sales\u2014Oprah\u2019s magazine has been described by writer Patricia Sellers of  Fortune  as \u201cthe most successful magazine launch ever. At a time when other longtime popular women\u2019s magazines have failed,  O, The Oprah Magazine  continues to attract a signi\ufb01  cantly large number of new readers. According to Gayle King, editor-at-large of the magazine, Oprah is obsessive about  O,  overseeing everything, even \u201ccommas\u201d and \u201cexclamation points,\u201d and numerous people have told of the amount of time and work she puts into it. Given the tight control of all Oprah operations, the likelihood 136 OPRAH WINFREYis that further information will not be provided.  From its inception, like many other magazines directed toward women,  O  has followed a pattern of topics known to appeal to a speci\ufb01  c group of women, those said to be more \ufb01  nancially upscale than Oprah\u2019s daily television watchers. Clearly, it is Oprah\u2019s magazine, and at times she seems ubiquitous. Fol-lowing Oprah\u2019s opening essay, \u201cHere We Go,\u201d is an attractive calen-dar for the month, with photographs appropriate to the season.    Each issue of the magazine offers advice of many kinds, much of it in Oprah\u2019s pieces, as well as in the regular monthly columns, and in articles by specialists on a particular subject. Like the comments made about Oprah being the national therapist, the magazine seems to ful\ufb01  ll the same role. Most of the problems of life \ufb01  nd their way eventually onto the beautiful glossy spread, which features a photo of Oprah on the cover as well as an impressive number inside. And, when a particularly beautiful picture of Oprah appears in newspapers and other magazines, it also is printed in  O.  Over a period of several years, through photos alone, a reader may gain insight about the star\u2019s preferences in clothing, from  AMERICA READS 137 Oprah Winfrey stands in front of the cover of the premiere issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine , at a press breakfast in New York, April 17, 2000.  When Oprah was asked why only her picture appears on every cover, her answer was somewhat ingenuous; it was to avoid the neces-sity of making choices of other people every month. In addition to the many pictures of Oprah inside the magazine, the photos are generally of celebrities\u2014perhaps alongside a brief article by or about them. And, although a great many of the arti-cles are about serious matters, there are occasional ones about pleasure, with descriptions and photos of parties Oprah has given. The table settings and linens may be like the products that the star recom-mends in every issue with its soft selling style in the magazine and on 138 OPRAH WINFREYtelevision.  Among the monthly articles, Oprah\u2019s \u201cHere We Go\u201d column in-troduces the theme treated in the majority of articles, most written by women and for women. The view held by readers of Oprah as a woman not only of wisdom but also tenderheartedness underlies advertisements as well as articles.  Every issue features an interview in which Oprah talks to someone famous or important to her, people she knows well or only through rep-utation, but generally those she admires. Some of the interviews have special interest for women, such as the one Oprah had at the home of Elizabeth Edwards when she had just written a book and appeared on the television program but before all the unsavory facts came out about her husband. On occasion, the interviews provide insight into Oprah herself. Oprah always credits her friends for the help they have given her in good times and bad. However, Oprah would undoubt-edly say it is almost impossible to fend off the press\u2014both reporters and television commentators\u2014who search out scandals.\u201d (The Youngs were guests on Oprah\u2019s show, during which Oprah pointedly revealed distaste for the entire matter. When Edwards\u2019s mistress and mother of his child Rielle Hunter was questioned by reporters about revealing photographs and a story in a magazine\u2014not  O, The Oprah Magazine \u2014she was critical of Oprah and her \u201cbelief systems about sex.\u201d In the back-and-forth stories that have been printed, it seems as though only Oprah escapes with her dignity intact.) Later, Oprah had Hunter on the show as a guest, although, to date, Hunter has not written a book. Illness and health are frequent subjects in  O,  and when some particular spark catches the attention of the public, Oprah interviews for the magazine unusual people whose strength and willpower in the face of a ravaging disease inspires others. Inasmuch as it seems the entire world watches Oprah\u2019s weight,  O  provides a forum to reveal her successes and failures, just as she has on her shows for years. (Perhaps this should be part of Oprah\u2019s admonition not to give away your power.)  Beauty, health, and style articles appear in every issue, as well as a monthly self-help piece by Oprah called \u201cSomething to Think About.\u201d 140 OPRAH WINFREYThis turns into a written exercise with the listing of numerous questions that need to be answered by the reader in the spaces provided.  More and more often in recent years, Oprah has written of events from her childhood, remembering her grandmother, who, despite her harshness and rigidity, communicated unspoken affection to the little girl through small actions. After years of trauma in several relationships, Oprah began to recognize the gifts her grandmother gave her.  Oprah is a sharer, which is different from relinquishing control.  At various times, Oprah has spoken of her own traumatic introduc-tion to sex. Although what Oprah tells the reader about her early life is no longer new, she identi\ufb01  es with those troubling points underlying teenage sex: the failure of parents to communicate with children, the distances between them, the need girls have for love and acceptance, and the pervasive unhappiness and self-blame resulting from sexual ac-tivities. The fact that Oprah is now middle aged and has dealt with the anguish of her experiences long ago does not alter the similarities  AMERICA READS 141of root causes. In an almost a Words-worthian view, Oprah writes that one must not grieve for what is not given, but take another path. Central messages such as these account for the affection and trust of women worldwide and undoubtedly will continue to be important in the time remaining for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  the ongoing  O  magazine, and other Oprah undertakings. \u201cThe Oprah Effect,\u201d  Publishers Weekly,  Oct. Amy Schwartz, \u201cWill Oprah Save the Book. David Carr, \u201cHow Oprahness Trumped Truthiness,\u201d  New York Times,  30 Jan.

Patricia Sellers, \u201cThe Business of Being Oprah: She Talked Her Way to the Top of Her Own Media Empire and Amassed a $1 Billion Fortune.", "Oprah_Book_Club_Choice_2002": "  Chapter 4  AMERICA READS  Always looking for ways to maintain the attention and involvement of her audience, and with an eye on ratings, Oprah and company intro-duced what was, at the time, a novel idea: a monthly television book club.) Oprah would chose a book she\u2019d read and enjoyed, then announce the title on the air; a program with the author\u2019s appearance would follow; and, \ufb01  nally, a group of diverse, carefully picked, packaged, and screened readers would discuss the book. At the beginning, every month, (except in summer) a book title would be announced, although there would be no regular day that the club would be on the program. Between 2000 and 2009, 36 books were assigned for club readers, but each year had a different number of books.\u201d With the usual declarations, hype, and advertising, the club was born 118 OPRAH WINFREYin televisionland, in 1996, when the \ufb01  rst book discussion took place, about Jacquelyn Mitchard\u2019s  The Deep End of the Ocean.   From the beginning, every book chosen by Oprah became a best-seller and an exceptional boon to the publishing industry. A June 5, 2009, article in the  New York Times  (with no attribution to a particular author) examines both Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah  and Oprah\u2019s in-\ufb02 uence on her book club members. Quoting Peck, the reviewer writes that the club has elevated Oprah \u201cto the status of cultural icon,\u201d an expert who \u201ctells people what to read,\u201d the \u201clessons\u201d to be learned, and the \u201cquestions to ask.\u201d Furthermore, says the reviewer, Oprah\u2019s chosen commentators are expected to \u201cagree with her . Although the reviewer \ufb01  nds both the show and Oprah\u2019s approach to books \u201csentimental, shallow and manipulative,\u201d the effect on the audience is powerful; it places Oprah \u201cas the savior of women from themselves,\u201d and, incidentally, makes Oprah and the publishing industry large amounts of money.  Linton Weeks, in the  Washington Post,  called Oprah\u2019s choice of books the equivalent of hitting the lottery for writers, but that same descrip-tion has obviously held true for publishers. 1  Throughout the country, bookstores large and small, knowing the effect of Oprah\u2019s pronounce-ments, immediately stocked numerous copies of the recommended book.  Publishers Weekly  backed up the data of Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence with the claim that hardcover and paperback books could not get onto best-seller lists unless readers knew the author\u2019s previous work or were an Oprah pick. 2   Oprah\u2019s choices are always available in paperback and thus available to a larger number of readers. Once her book club became a reality, a browser or reader going into any bookstore and numerous coffee shops  AMERICA READS 119could not fail to see a special display, shelf, or bookcase, given over to \u201cAn Oprah Selection.\u201d Her chosen books even had an imprint to that effect. Only a year after the introduction of the book club,  Newsweek,  along with other magazines, labeled her the most signi\ufb01  cant person in the modern book world, and one  Newsweek  writer, in reviewing a thriller, had words of advice for publishers about turning their books into best-sellers: \u201cpray for an act of God. or Oprah.\u201d Inspirational books, even if not chosen for Oprah\u2019s club, became very popular as a result of exposure on her show, particularly after the events of 9/11. Not only did his \ufb01  rst book become a best-seller, but after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, the child signed a \ufb01  ve-book contract.\u201d When a Maryland park and statue were dedicated to the boy\u2019s memory, Oprah was in the group of celebrants.  Not everyone had liked Oprah\u2019s pushing the young poet\u2019s work. 3   Writer David Streitfeld (then on staff at the  Washington Post ) was one of the few writers who found Oprah\u2019s efforts commendable in urg-ing people to read and compared her effectiveness in getting people interested in books to that of 19th-century tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who, among his other deeds, endowed 2,500 librar-ies. But a  Washington Post  colleague of Streitfeld\u2019s, Amy Schwartz, was not as fulsome with her praise, raising the possibility that Oprah was simply harvesting the returns of a recent national revival of reading. 4  Nonetheless, so in\ufb02  uential was Oprah considered in her effect on na-tional reading habits that, in 1999, the National Book Foundation, at an elegant black-tie affair hosted by actor Steve Martin, presented Oprah with its 50th anniversary gold medal. Even a decade later, Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence on reading has remained signi\ufb01  cant. Hers has been 120 OPRAH WINFREYthe largest book club in the world\u2014ever.\u201d 5  However, the books are for sale, and most importantly the book-sellers order whatever Oprah recommends, knowing that there will be a huge readership for the product.  Accepting the medal from the foundation, Oprah spoke of the para-mount role books had played in her life.  Yet, despite her passion for the written word and after several years of praise for her effect on the publishing industry and the reading pub-lic\u2019s increased interest in books, Oprah, who had been nicknamed the \u201cqueen bee of book clubs,\u201d suddenly decided to abandon the club as part of her television program. On a Friday show (often a day when an-nouncements are made that don\u2019t make the news), she informed the audience that the novel  Sula  would be the last book chosen for the club. Although Oprah did not tell the audience of other fac-tors in her decision, there was more to the matter than lack of worthy books.  Regardless of the huge number of books sold, from 600,000 to a mil-lion new copies per book, a market survey revealed only a limited view-ing audience for the television discussion of books, considerably less than those who watch Oprah\u2019s regular daily programs. Also, reportedly, sales of books were beginning to \ufb02  atten (though Oprah\u2019s picks con- AMERICA READS 121tinued to sell more than other works). Meanwhile, an \u201cinside source\u201d leaked the somewhat curious disclosure that the task of screening one book per month was exhausting for Oprah and her staff, \u201cthe single hardest thing that had to be done for the television program.\u201d If so, it is surprising that Oprah continuously refers to books she is reading or has read. Random House put a full-page \u201cThank you, Oprah\u201d in the April 12, 2002, edition of the  New York Times. As Carlin Romano of the  Philadelphia Inquirer  pointed out, the \ufb01  nal book Oprah picked,  Sula,  had been written 28 years earlier by Toni Morrison, one of four Morrison novels Oprah had chosen. Romano\u2019s piece turned more derisive with the comment that anyone as rich as Oprah could certainly give up the arduous task of a monthly book selection and take an easier road for her program \u201clike talking between commercials or serving in the  Israeli Defense Forces. \u201d 6  Crit-ics also pointed out that more variety might prove more palatable to readers as well as reviewers, some of whom found the Oprah selections excessively restrictive\u2014that is, with a sameness from one work to another.  Although fans continued to associate Oprah with books, a num-ber of negative statements were made about her choices. Critic Carol Muller listed a series of \u201cOprah topics\u201d that she found in books she was 122 OPRAH WINFREYreviewing. Those topics were listed without comment as possible themes for Oprah\u2019s programs and for articles in Oprah\u2019s magazine: lesbianism, abuse, osteoporosis, devotion, retardation, and a crisis of faith. Such ad-verse judgments about Oprah\u2019s subject matter are related to various ear-lier deprecatory reviews by others, criticizing many of Oprah\u2019s choices as focusing on dysfunctional people. For instance,  Wall Street Journal  writer Cynthia Crossen might have been speaking for various review-ers in stating that the reach of Oprah\u2019s book selections went from \u201cA (abused) to B (battered). Another reviewer, Robert Clark, suggested that the term \u201cwoman\u2019s novel\u201d should be dropped for her choices, and \u201cthe Oprah novel\u201d should be substituted because her selections have the same formula.  The excuse given for  The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2019s abandonment of the book club had numerous people wondering about Oprah\u2019s judgment.\u201d With strong, tongue-in-cheek language, he called Oprah\u2019s dismissal of the club \u201cBetrayal.\u201d (Other book clubs have since been launched; one in particular in Britain, seeking what is known as \u201cthe Oprah effect,\u201d has been touted as bringing in a \u201cwhole new generation of literary superstars.\u201d  The cartoonist, making fun not only of Oprah\u2019s loss of interest in books but also of her television persona, satirizes both the star and the audience.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest. Did the majority of readers like her choice of books. Oprah\u2019s good friend, writer Maya Angelou, weighed in, stating that she didn\u2019t agree with all the choices, but reading is what matters. Consid-ering the vast amount of publicity given to the dustup Oprah and com-pany had with one of the novelists, Jonathan Franzen, shortly before the decision to give up the book segment of the program, interest in the book selections (among readers, nonreaders, and, in fact, general interest throughout the country) was aroused to a pitch not enjoyed before and could only have served to swell the numbers of the show\u2019s audience. Keller is not alone in her view that the book club has been an \u201castonishing cultural force.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership.\u201d  Book critics have noted that all books anointed by Oprah become best-sellers, bringing in millions of dollars to the author and, of course, the publishing industry. His own book, said Franzen, is in the high art tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to be known as an Oprah Book Club choice.  Sides in the con\ufb02  ict were chosen, but far more were and are on Oprah\u2019s team.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club. For a number of years, Oprah also selected non\ufb01  ction publications for themes on her program.  One tenet of many of these programs, and stressed also through the club\u2014is an Oprah mantra: everyone, male and female, young and old, has to learn for herself or himself that our lives are in our own hands. The subject, as in the lessons of the books, is one that resonates in many, many speeches and interviews that Oprah gives, re\ufb02  ecting her own learning curve over the years.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club. While being honored with a standing ovation for all she had previously done to inspire an interest in current books, she told the Association of American Publishers she would be returning to the recommendation of books, \u201cbut with a difference.\u201d There was speculation about whether her decision would bring the same kind of joy as her announcement several years ago of the formation of the original book club. Would the return to classics\u2014in the way that Oprah\u2019s other programs have stimulated viewers\u2014lead to a renewal of interest in literature and literary degrees in colleges and universities. The novel, which tells of the sexual and intellectual frustrations of an unhappily married Victorian woman, is one that, he believes, offers endless pos-sibilities for Oprah\u2019s program. And Oprah has chosen a number of them.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall.   It seemed for a time the classics would later have a revived chance for sales with Oprah\u2019s new club undertaking, even if the authors are dead. A world-famous star with Oprah\u2019s international follow-ing can have a major impact on the rejuvenation of reading. When Oprah made the promised announcement of a newly revived book club, stores immediately were deluged by sales.  Oprah soon gave up on the classics and returned to more contem-porary books, which appear to have little or no relationship to each other. Whether Oprah herself chooses the books or members of her staff do so is not made public. Some novelists appear to be favorites; for example, Faulkner\u2019s books have been chosen three times (a some-what surprising choice given that college students\u2014even literature 128 OPRAH WINFREYmajors\u2014are known to need assistance with his works). However, it isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah favors novels of the South. In the mix of choices are some philosophic/religious/spiritual works that surely would not have become best-sellers without the Winfrey imprimatur.  When Oprah resumed the program with her book club, publishers continued to be thrilled with its enormous impact on her following, knowing they\u2014the publishers\u2014had the equivalent of the baseball \ufb01  eld story: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d  But with Oprah\u2019s announcement a few years later that she would be giving up her daily show on network television, gloom reigns today in the publishing industry. Although there has been much wavering about the matter, it   appears that there will be no book club in the world of OWN. Several newspapers have stated openly that Oprah\u2019s \u201cbig switch\u201d will not only change afternoon television but also that book publishers are facing \u201cdoom.  Keeping track of Oprah\u2019s wishes about her book club can be dizzy-ing for her reading followers.\u201d 7   A complete list of the 36 newer choices on Oprah\u2019s soon-to-be-extinct book club books might be compared to an electrocardiogram, as the lines go up and down. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Oprah\u2019s favorites were included, as were recommendations from experts in the \ufb01  eld of children\u2019s literature.  One writer, unaf\ufb01  liated with any of Oprah\u2019s undertakings, decided that Oprah herself would make a good subject for a children\u2019s book. Called  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weatherford, the trade journal  Publishers Weekly  listed it along with reviews of other chil-dren\u2019s books.\u201d 8   As in the past, some Oprah book choices have made it to the big screen, and Oprah intends to continue that practice. Because there are other works being considered, it may be that various types of movies will replace the book club. Even though Oprah will be giving up the book club when she leaves her show, her publication,  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which has been an outstanding success, will continue. The failure rate for start-ups in maga-zines is extremely high; even Oprah\u2019s second venture into magazine publishing,  Oprah At Home,  also came to an end.  For a short period of time, the two stars, O\u2019Donnell and Oprah, seemed to be almost in lockstep: television, magazines, and even books for readers. O\u2019Donnell, though, limited her picks to children\u2019s books and even announced it before her decision to leave her long-running show. Nothing came of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s plans for a book club, however. 134 OPRAH WINFREY Famous names are expected to sell products and magazines. Signi\ufb01  cantly, despite the fact that advertising is up, news reports have also pointed to somewhat poorer circulation for Oprah\u2019s magazine, which has never been touched by scandals of any sort. Neither Stewart\u2019s nor O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, however, seem to have offered much of a challenge to Oprah\u2019s, even though there was no apparent difference to be found on the magazine racks in stores, inasmuch as some of the largest grocery chains stocked both Stewart\u2019s and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, sometimes one or the other, but, inexplicably, not Oprah\u2019s for a long time.  Oprah has been a huge factor in the sale of books, a boon to writ-ers, publishers, and bookstores, and even to discount and department stores such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and Target, all better known for food items and other merchandise. Even though some stores did not publicize Oprah\u2019s book choices by distinguishing them from other books, most book stores contained separate racks of Oprah\u2019s book selec-tions. 9  Although those early books are no longer featured, the ones that remained in print still carried the sticker an-nouncing them as an Oprah choice, and once Oprah came back to the business of touting books, no matter the subject, logos and sales went up. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show.  Like her television programs and her book clubs\u2014with their enor-mous effect on sales\u2014Oprah\u2019s magazine has been described by writer Patricia Sellers of  Fortune  as \u201cthe most successful magazine launch ever. At a time when other longtime popular women\u2019s magazines have failed,  O, The Oprah Magazine  continues to attract a signi\ufb01  cantly large number of new readers. According to Gayle King, editor-at-large of the magazine, Oprah is obsessive about  O,  overseeing everything, even \u201ccommas\u201d and \u201cexclamation points,\u201d and numerous people have told of the amount of time and work she puts into it. Given the tight control of all Oprah operations, the likelihood 136 OPRAH WINFREYis that further information will not be provided.  From its inception, like many other magazines directed toward women,  O  has followed a pattern of topics known to appeal to a speci\ufb01  c group of women, those said to be more \ufb01  nancially upscale than Oprah\u2019s daily television watchers. Clearly, it is Oprah\u2019s magazine, and at times she seems ubiquitous. Fol-lowing Oprah\u2019s opening essay, \u201cHere We Go,\u201d is an attractive calen-dar for the month, with photographs appropriate to the season.    Each issue of the magazine offers advice of many kinds, much of it in Oprah\u2019s pieces, as well as in the regular monthly columns, and in articles by specialists on a particular subject. Most of the problems of life \ufb01  nd their way eventually onto the beautiful glossy spread, which features a photo of Oprah on the cover as well as an impressive number inside. And, when a particularly beautiful picture of Oprah appears in newspapers and other magazines, it also is printed in  O.  Over a period of several years, through photos alone, a reader may gain insight about the star\u2019s preferences in clothing, from  AMERICA READS 137 Oprah Winfrey stands in front of the cover of the premiere issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine , at a press breakfast in New York, April 17, 2000.  When Oprah was asked why only her picture appears on every cover, her answer was somewhat ingenuous; it was to avoid the neces-sity of making choices of other people every month. In addition to the many pictures of Oprah inside the magazine, the photos are generally of celebrities\u2014perhaps alongside a brief article by or about them. And, although a great many of the arti-cles are about serious matters, there are occasional ones about pleasure, with descriptions and photos of parties Oprah has given. The table settings and linens may be like the products that the star recom-mends in every issue with its soft selling style in the magazine and on 138 OPRAH WINFREYtelevision.  Among the monthly articles, Oprah\u2019s \u201cHere We Go\u201d column in-troduces the theme treated in the majority of articles, most written by women and for women. The view held by readers of Oprah as a woman not only of wisdom but also tenderheartedness underlies advertisements as well as articles. On occasion, the interviews provide insight into Oprah herself. Oprah always credits her friends for the help they have given her in good times and bad.\u201d (The Youngs were guests on Oprah\u2019s show, during which Oprah pointedly revealed distaste for the entire matter. When Edwards\u2019s mistress and mother of his child Rielle Hunter was questioned by reporters about revealing photographs and a story in a magazine\u2014not  O, The Oprah Magazine \u2014she was critical of Oprah and her \u201cbelief systems about sex.\u201d In the back-and-forth stories that have been printed, it seems as though only Oprah escapes with her dignity intact.) Later, Oprah had Hunter on the show as a guest, although, to date, Hunter has not written a book. Illness and health are frequent subjects in  O,  and when some particular spark catches the attention of the public, Oprah interviews for the magazine unusual people whose strength and willpower in the face of a ravaging disease inspires others. (Although illness and health are not usually the focus of plots in book club choices, the books also frequently seem to have links in their subject matter; reviewers some-times suggest that certain novels would be good choices for the club because they are depressing and/or painful. Inasmuch as it seems the entire world watches Oprah\u2019s weight,  O  provides a forum to reveal her successes and failures, just as she has on her shows for years. (Perhaps this should be part of Oprah\u2019s admonition not to give away your power.)  Beauty, health, and style articles appear in every issue, as well as a monthly self-help piece by Oprah called \u201cSomething to Think About.\u201d 140 OPRAH WINFREYThis turns into a written exercise with the listing of numerous questions that need to be answered by the reader in the spaces provided.  Oprah is a sharer, which is different from relinquishing control. Although what Oprah tells the reader about her early life is no longer new, she identi\ufb01  es with those troubling points underlying teenage sex: the failure of parents to communicate with children, the distances between them, the need girls have for love and acceptance, and the pervasive unhappiness and self-blame resulting from sexual ac-tivities. Central messages such as these account for the affection and trust of women worldwide and undoubtedly will continue to be important in the time remaining for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  the ongoing  O  magazine, and other Oprah undertakings. \u201cThe Oprah Effect,\u201d  Publishers Weekly,  Oct.

In this piece, he takes Oprah to task humorously for her obviously manufactured excuse to cancel the Book Club. Review of  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weather-ford,  Publishers Weekly,  22 Feb. Kate Pickert, \u201cOprah\u2019s Book Club,\u201d  Time,  26 Sept. Patricia Sellers, \u201cThe Business of Being Oprah: She Talked Her Way to the Top of Her Own Media Empire and Amassed a $1 Billion Fortune.", "Oprah_Book_Pick_2002": "  Chapter 4  AMERICA READS  Always looking for ways to maintain the attention and involvement of her audience, and with an eye on ratings, Oprah and company intro-duced what was, at the time, a novel idea: a monthly television book club.) Oprah would chose a book she\u2019d read and enjoyed, then announce the title on the air; a program with the author\u2019s appearance would follow; and, \ufb01  nally, a group of diverse, carefully picked, packaged, and screened readers would discuss the book.   From the beginning, every book chosen by Oprah became a best-seller and an exceptional boon to the publishing industry. A June 5, 2009, article in the  New York Times  (with no attribution to a particular author) examines both Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah  and Oprah\u2019s in-\ufb02 uence on her book club members. Quoting Peck, the reviewer writes that the club has elevated Oprah \u201cto the status of cultural icon,\u201d an expert who \u201ctells people what to read,\u201d the \u201clessons\u201d to be learned, and the \u201cquestions to ask.\u201d Furthermore, says the reviewer, Oprah\u2019s chosen commentators are expected to \u201cagree with her . Although the reviewer \ufb01  nds both the show and Oprah\u2019s approach to books \u201csentimental, shallow and manipulative,\u201d the effect on the audience is powerful; it places Oprah \u201cas the savior of women from themselves,\u201d and, incidentally, makes Oprah and the publishing industry large amounts of money. Peck has pointed to a notable dif-ference between the lessons Oprah imparts and those of classrooms: Oprah is concerned with self-discovery and wants the focus to be on lessons learned about oneself, whereas university classroom instruction tends to focus on separating the self from the work and therefore main-taining objectivity.  Linton Weeks, in the  Washington Post,  called Oprah\u2019s choice of books the equivalent of hitting the lottery for writers, but that same descrip-tion has obviously held true for publishers. 1  Throughout the country, bookstores large and small, knowing the effect of Oprah\u2019s pronounce-ments, immediately stocked numerous copies of the recommended book.

Such ad-verse judgments about Oprah\u2019s subject matter are related to various ear-lier deprecatory reviews by others, criticizing many of Oprah\u2019s choices as focusing on dysfunctional people. For instance,  Wall Street Journal  writer Cynthia Crossen might have been speaking for various review-ers in stating that the reach of Oprah\u2019s book selections went from \u201cA (abused) to B (battered). Another reviewer, Robert Clark, suggested that the term \u201cwoman\u2019s novel\u201d should be dropped for her choices, and \u201cthe Oprah novel\u201d should be substituted because her selections have the same formula.  The excuse given for  The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2019s abandonment of the book club had numerous people wondering about Oprah\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Other book clubs have since been launched; one in particular in Britain, seeking what is known as \u201cthe Oprah effect,\u201d has been touted as bringing in a \u201cwhole new generation of literary superstars.\u201d)  Another farcical illustration of the mileage gained from the clumsi-ness of Oprah\u2019s action appeared in a mocking comic strip drawn by Matt Janz. Titled \u201cOut of the Gene Pool,\u201d the strip had Oprah speaking of the boredom she had felt in reading while she ate her lunch; no lon-ger interested in the book, she put a carrot in her nose; that experience, which she describes as \u201cspiritual,\u201d provides \u201crebirth.\u201d  The cartoonist, making fun not only of Oprah\u2019s loss of interest in books but also of her television persona, satirizes both the star and the audience. Oprah\u2019s renewal comes from a vegetable, not from some clever or brilliant thesis or work of art.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest. Did the majority of readers like her choice of books. Oprah\u2019s good friend, writer Maya Angelou, weighed in, stating that she didn\u2019t agree with all the choices, but reading is what matters. Consid-ering the vast amount of publicity given to the dustup Oprah and com-pany had with one of the novelists, Jonathan Franzen, shortly before the decision to give up the book segment of the program, interest in the book selections (among readers, nonreaders, and, in fact, general interest throughout the country) was aroused to a pitch not enjoyed before and could only have served to swell the numbers of the show\u2019s audience.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. Because of a public brou-haha with Oprah, Franzen became the most-written-about writer of that 124 OPRAH WINFREYyear. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership.\u201d  Book critics have noted that all books anointed by Oprah become best-sellers, bringing in millions of dollars to the author and, of course, the publishing industry. His own book, said Franzen, is in the high art tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to be known as an Oprah Book Club choice.  Sides in the con\ufb02  ict were chosen, but far more were and are on Oprah\u2019s team.\u201d  It is surprising that the Oprah producers in their background checks of participants in their programs overlooked Franzen\u2019s essays and his hostile statements about the shamelessness of television.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club. For a number of years, Oprah also selected non\ufb01  ction publications for themes on her program.  One tenet of many of these programs, and stressed also through the club\u2014is an Oprah mantra: everyone, male and female, young and old, has to learn for herself or himself that our lives are in our own hands. The subject, as in the lessons of the books, is one that resonates in many, many speeches and interviews that Oprah gives, re\ufb02  ecting her own learning curve over the years.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club. While being honored with a standing ovation for all she had previously done to inspire an interest in current books, she told the Association of American Publishers she would be returning to the recommendation of books, \u201cbut with a difference. Would the return to classics\u2014in the way that Oprah\u2019s other programs have stimulated viewers\u2014lead to a renewal of interest in literature and literary degrees in colleges and universities. The novel, which tells of the sexual and intellectual frustrations of an unhappily married Victorian woman, is one that, he believes, offers endless pos-sibilities for Oprah\u2019s program. And Oprah has chosen a number of them.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall. Oprah described the book as \u201ca spiritual autobi-ography,\u201d an apt term for a work that reports on faith, race, and the in\ufb02 uence of great leaders such as Mandela and Gandhi. In talking on her show about the actor, Oprah called Poitier \u201cone of the greatest men .   It seemed for a time the classics would later have a revived chance for sales with Oprah\u2019s new club undertaking, even if the authors are dead. A world-famous star with Oprah\u2019s international follow-ing can have a major impact on the rejuvenation of reading. When Oprah made the promised announcement of a newly revived book club, stores immediately were deluged by sales.  Oprah soon gave up on the classics and returned to more contem-porary books, which appear to have little or no relationship to each other. Whether Oprah herself chooses the books or members of her staff do so is not made public. Some novelists appear to be favorites; for example, Faulkner\u2019s books have been chosen three times (a some-what surprising choice given that college students\u2014even literature 128 OPRAH WINFREYmajors\u2014are known to need assistance with his works). However, it isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah favors novels of the South. In the mix of choices are some philosophic/religious/spiritual works that surely would not have become best-sellers without the Winfrey imprimatur.  When Oprah resumed the program with her book club, publishers continued to be thrilled with its enormous impact on her following, knowing they\u2014the publishers\u2014had the equivalent of the baseball \ufb01  eld story: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d  But with Oprah\u2019s announcement a few years later that she would be giving up her daily show on network television, gloom reigns today in the publishing industry. Several newspapers have stated openly that Oprah\u2019s \u201cbig switch\u201d will not only change afternoon television but also that book publishers are facing \u201cdoom.  Keeping track of Oprah\u2019s wishes about her book club can be dizzy-ing for her reading followers.\u201d 7   A complete list of the 36 newer choices on Oprah\u2019s soon-to-be-extinct book club books might be compared to an electrocardiogram, as the lines go up and down. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Oprah\u2019s favorites were included, as were recommendations from experts in the \ufb01  eld of children\u2019s literature.  One writer, unaf\ufb01  liated with any of Oprah\u2019s undertakings, decided that Oprah herself would make a good subject for a children\u2019s book. Called  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weatherford, the trade journal  Publishers Weekly  listed it along with reviews of other chil-dren\u2019s books.\u201d 8   As in the past, some Oprah book choices have made it to the big screen, and Oprah intends to continue that practice. Even while ready-ing herself for the major change to cable television, she and Tom Hanks announced plans to coproduce a movie based on an Oprah book pick,  The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. Even though Oprah will be giving up the book club when she leaves her show, her publication,  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which has been an outstanding success, will continue. The failure rate for start-ups in maga-zines is extremely high; even Oprah\u2019s second venture into magazine publishing,  Oprah At Home,  also came to an end. She was famous, funny, and popular, and she showed  AMERICA READS 131some of the same personality traits of both Oprah and Stewart: strength and determination and staying power with audiences.  For a short period of time, the two stars, O\u2019Donnell and Oprah, seemed to be almost in lockstep: television, magazines, and even books for readers. O\u2019Donnell, though, limited her picks to children\u2019s books and even announced it before her decision to leave her long-running show. Her tell-all book had preceded by a month her exiting her television show. 134 OPRAH WINFREY Famous names are expected to sell products and magazines. Signi\ufb01  cantly, despite the fact that advertising is up, news reports have also pointed to somewhat poorer circulation for Oprah\u2019s magazine, which has never been touched by scandals of any sort. Neither Stewart\u2019s nor O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, however, seem to have offered much of a challenge to Oprah\u2019s, even though there was no apparent difference to be found on the magazine racks in stores, inasmuch as some of the largest grocery chains stocked both Stewart\u2019s and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, sometimes one or the other, but, inexplicably, not Oprah\u2019s for a long time.  Oprah has been a huge factor in the sale of books, a boon to writ-ers, publishers, and bookstores, and even to discount and department stores such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and Target, all better known for food items and other merchandise. Even though some stores did not publicize Oprah\u2019s book choices by distinguishing them from other books, most book stores contained separate racks of Oprah\u2019s book selec-tions. 9  Although those early books are no longer featured, the ones that remained in print still carried the sticker an-nouncing them as an Oprah choice, and once Oprah came back to the business of touting books, no matter the subject, logos and sales went up. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show.  Like her television programs and her book clubs\u2014with their enor-mous effect on sales\u2014Oprah\u2019s magazine has been described by writer Patricia Sellers of  Fortune  as \u201cthe most successful magazine launch ever. At a time when other longtime popular women\u2019s magazines have failed,  O, The Oprah Magazine  continues to attract a signi\ufb01  cantly large number of new readers. According to Gayle King, editor-at-large of the magazine, Oprah is obsessive about  O,  overseeing everything, even \u201ccommas\u201d and \u201cexclamation points,\u201d and numerous people have told of the amount of time and work she puts into it. Given the tight control of all Oprah operations, the likelihood 136 OPRAH WINFREYis that further information will not be provided. Clearly, it is Oprah\u2019s magazine, and at times she seems ubiquitous. Fol-lowing Oprah\u2019s opening essay, \u201cHere We Go,\u201d is an attractive calen-dar for the month, with photographs appropriate to the season.    Each issue of the magazine offers advice of many kinds, much of it in Oprah\u2019s pieces, as well as in the regular monthly columns, and in articles by specialists on a particular subject. Most of the problems of life \ufb01  nd their way eventually onto the beautiful glossy spread, which features a photo of Oprah on the cover as well as an impressive number inside. And, when a particularly beautiful picture of Oprah appears in newspapers and other magazines, it also is printed in  O.  Over a period of several years, through photos alone, a reader may gain insight about the star\u2019s preferences in clothing, from  AMERICA READS 137 Oprah Winfrey stands in front of the cover of the premiere issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine , at a press breakfast in New York, April 17, 2000.  When Oprah was asked why only her picture appears on every cover, her answer was somewhat ingenuous; it was to avoid the neces-sity of making choices of other people every month. In addition to the many pictures of Oprah inside the magazine, the photos are generally of celebrities\u2014perhaps alongside a brief article by or about them. And, although a great many of the arti-cles are about serious matters, there are occasional ones about pleasure, with descriptions and photos of parties Oprah has given.  Among the monthly articles, Oprah\u2019s \u201cHere We Go\u201d column in-troduces the theme treated in the majority of articles, most written by women and for women. The view held by readers of Oprah as a woman not only of wisdom but also tenderheartedness underlies advertisements as well as articles.  Every issue features an interview in which Oprah talks to someone famous or important to her, people she knows well or only through rep-utation, but generally those she admires. On occasion, the interviews provide insight into Oprah herself. Oprah always credits her friends for the help they have given her in good times and bad. When Edwards\u2019s mistress and mother of his child Rielle Hunter was questioned by reporters about revealing photographs and a story in a magazine\u2014not  O, The Oprah Magazine \u2014she was critical of Oprah and her \u201cbelief systems about sex.\u201d In the back-and-forth stories that have been printed, it seems as though only Oprah escapes with her dignity intact.) Later, Oprah had Hunter on the show as a guest, although, to date, Hunter has not written a book. Illness and health are frequent subjects in  O,  and when some particular spark catches the attention of the public, Oprah interviews for the magazine unusual people whose strength and willpower in the face of a ravaging disease inspires others. Inasmuch as it seems the entire world watches Oprah\u2019s weight,  O  provides a forum to reveal her successes and failures, just as she has on her shows for years. (Perhaps this should be part of Oprah\u2019s admonition not to give away your power.)  Beauty, health, and style articles appear in every issue, as well as a monthly self-help piece by Oprah called \u201cSomething to Think About.\u201d 140 OPRAH WINFREYThis turns into a written exercise with the listing of numerous questions that need to be answered by the reader in the spaces provided.  Oprah is a sharer, which is different from relinquishing control.  At various times, Oprah has spoken of her own traumatic introduc-tion to sex. Although what Oprah tells the reader about her early life is no longer new, she identi\ufb01  es with those troubling points underlying teenage sex: the failure of parents to communicate with children, the distances between them, the need girls have for love and acceptance, and the pervasive unhappiness and self-blame resulting from sexual ac-tivities. The fact that Oprah is now middle aged and has dealt with the anguish of her experiences long ago does not alter the similarities  AMERICA READS 141of root causes. In an almost a Words-worthian view, Oprah writes that one must not grieve for what is not given, but take another path. Central messages such as these account for the affection and trust of women worldwide and undoubtedly will continue to be important in the time remaining for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  the ongoing  O  magazine, and other Oprah undertakings. \u201cThe Oprah Effect,\u201d  Publishers Weekly,  Oct.

Oprah would chose a book she\u2019d read and enjoyed, then announce the title on the air; a program with the author\u2019s appearance would follow; and, \ufb01  nally, a group of diverse, carefully picked, packaged, and screened readers would discuss the book.\u201d With the usual declarations, hype, and advertising, the club was born 118 OPRAH WINFREYin televisionland, in 1996, when the \ufb01  rst book discussion took place, about Jacquelyn Mitchard\u2019s  The Deep End of the Ocean.   From the beginning, every book chosen by Oprah became a best-seller and an exceptional boon to the publishing industry. A June 5, 2009, article in the  New York Times  (with no attribution to a particular author) examines both Janice Peck\u2019s  The Age of Oprah  and Oprah\u2019s in-\ufb02 uence on her book club members. Quoting Peck, the reviewer writes that the club has elevated Oprah \u201cto the status of cultural icon,\u201d an expert who \u201ctells people what to read,\u201d the \u201clessons\u201d to be learned, and the \u201cquestions to ask.\u201d Furthermore, says the reviewer, Oprah\u2019s chosen commentators are expected to \u201cagree with her . Although the reviewer \ufb01  nds both the show and Oprah\u2019s approach to books \u201csentimental, shallow and manipulative,\u201d the effect on the audience is powerful; it places Oprah \u201cas the savior of women from themselves,\u201d and, incidentally, makes Oprah and the publishing industry large amounts of money. Peck has pointed to a notable dif-ference between the lessons Oprah imparts and those of classrooms: Oprah is concerned with self-discovery and wants the focus to be on lessons learned about oneself, whereas university classroom instruction tends to focus on separating the self from the work and therefore main-taining objectivity.  Linton Weeks, in the  Washington Post,  called Oprah\u2019s choice of books the equivalent of hitting the lottery for writers, but that same descrip-tion has obviously held true for publishers. 1  Throughout the country, bookstores large and small, knowing the effect of Oprah\u2019s pronounce-ments, immediately stocked numerous copies of the recommended book.  Publishers Weekly  backed up the data of Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence with the claim that hardcover and paperback books could not get onto best-seller lists unless readers knew the author\u2019s previous work or were an Oprah pick. 2   Oprah\u2019s choices are always available in paperback and thus available to a larger number of readers. Once her book club became a reality, a browser or reader going into any bookstore and numerous coffee shops  AMERICA READS 119could not fail to see a special display, shelf, or bookcase, given over to \u201cAn Oprah Selection.\u201d Her chosen books even had an imprint to that effect. or Oprah.\u201d Inspirational books, even if not chosen for Oprah\u2019s club, became very popular as a result of exposure on her show, particularly after the events of 9/11. Not only did his \ufb01  rst book become a best-seller, but after his appearance on Oprah\u2019s show, the child signed a \ufb01  ve-book contract. Oprah called him inspirational, a \u201cfriend,\u201d and \u201can angel on earth.\u201d When a Maryland park and statue were dedicated to the boy\u2019s memory, Oprah was in the group of celebrants.  Not everyone had liked Oprah\u2019s pushing the young poet\u2019s work. 3   Writer David Streitfeld (then on staff at the  Washington Post ) was one of the few writers who found Oprah\u2019s efforts commendable in urg-ing people to read and compared her effectiveness in getting people interested in books to that of 19th-century tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who, among his other deeds, endowed 2,500 librar-ies. But a  Washington Post  colleague of Streitfeld\u2019s, Amy Schwartz, was not as fulsome with her praise, raising the possibility that Oprah was simply harvesting the returns of a recent national revival of reading. 4  Nonetheless, so in\ufb02  uential was Oprah considered in her effect on na-tional reading habits that, in 1999, the National Book Foundation, at an elegant black-tie affair hosted by actor Steve Martin, presented Oprah with its 50th anniversary gold medal. Even a decade later, Oprah\u2019s in\ufb02  uence on reading has remained signi\ufb01  cant. Hers has been 120 OPRAH WINFREYthe largest book club in the world\u2014ever.\u201d 5  However, the books are for sale, and most importantly the book-sellers order whatever Oprah recommends, knowing that there will be a huge readership for the product.  Accepting the medal from the foundation, Oprah spoke of the para-mount role books had played in her life.  Yet, despite her passion for the written word and after several years of praise for her effect on the publishing industry and the reading pub-lic\u2019s increased interest in books, Oprah, who had been nicknamed the \u201cqueen bee of book clubs,\u201d suddenly decided to abandon the club as part of her television program. On a Friday show (often a day when an-nouncements are made that don\u2019t make the news), she informed the audience that the novel  Sula  would be the last book chosen for the club. She announced, in a statement that would provoke criticism, that she no longer could \ufb01  nd interesting books to read, introduce, and discuss on her program. Although Oprah did not tell the audience of other fac-tors in her decision, there was more to the matter than lack of worthy books.  Regardless of the huge number of books sold, from 600,000 to a mil-lion new copies per book, a market survey revealed only a limited view-ing audience for the television discussion of books, considerably less than those who watch Oprah\u2019s regular daily programs. Also, reportedly, sales of books were beginning to \ufb02  atten (though Oprah\u2019s picks con- AMERICA READS 121tinued to sell more than other works). Meanwhile, an \u201cinside source\u201d leaked the somewhat curious disclosure that the task of screening one book per month was exhausting for Oprah and her staff, \u201cthe single hardest thing that had to be done for the television program.\u201d If so, it is surprising that Oprah continuously refers to books she is reading or has read.  Some of the publishing companies sturdily supported Oprah\u2019s deci-sion publicly\u2014after all, how could they do otherwise, given the im-portant \ufb01  nancial boost she\u2019d made to the industry. Random House put a full-page \u201cThank you, Oprah\u201d in the April 12, 2002, edition of the  New York Times. As Carlin Romano of the  Philadelphia Inquirer  pointed out, the \ufb01  nal book Oprah picked,  Sula,  had been written 28 years earlier by Toni Morrison, one of four Morrison novels Oprah had chosen. Romano\u2019s piece turned more derisive with the comment that anyone as rich as Oprah could certainly give up the arduous task of a monthly book selection and take an easier road for her program \u201clike talking between commercials or serving in the  Israeli Defense Forces. \u201d 6  Crit-ics also pointed out that more variety might prove more palatable to readers as well as reviewers, some of whom found the Oprah selections excessively restrictive\u2014that is, with a sameness from one work to another.  Although fans continued to associate Oprah with books, a num-ber of negative statements were made about her choices. Critic Carol Muller listed a series of \u201cOprah topics\u201d that she found in books she was 122 OPRAH WINFREYreviewing. Those topics were listed without comment as possible themes for Oprah\u2019s programs and for articles in Oprah\u2019s magazine: lesbianism, abuse, osteoporosis, devotion, retardation, and a crisis of faith. Such ad-verse judgments about Oprah\u2019s subject matter are related to various ear-lier deprecatory reviews by others, criticizing many of Oprah\u2019s choices as focusing on dysfunctional people. For instance,  Wall Street Journal  writer Cynthia Crossen might have been speaking for various review-ers in stating that the reach of Oprah\u2019s book selections went from \u201cA (abused) to B (battered). Another reviewer, Robert Clark, suggested that the term \u201cwoman\u2019s novel\u201d should be dropped for her choices, and \u201cthe Oprah novel\u201d should be substituted because her selections have the same formula.  The excuse given for  The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2019s abandonment of the book club had numerous people wondering about Oprah\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Other book clubs have since been launched; one in particular in Britain, seeking what is known as \u201cthe Oprah effect,\u201d has been touted as bringing in a \u201cwhole new generation of literary superstars.\u201d)  Another farcical illustration of the mileage gained from the clumsi-ness of Oprah\u2019s action appeared in a mocking comic strip drawn by Matt Janz. Titled \u201cOut of the Gene Pool,\u201d the strip had Oprah speaking of the boredom she had felt in reading while she ate her lunch; no lon-ger interested in the book, she put a carrot in her nose; that experience, which she describes as \u201cspiritual,\u201d provides \u201crebirth.\u201d  The cartoonist, making fun not only of Oprah\u2019s loss of interest in books but also of her television persona, satirizes both the star and the audience. Oprah\u2019s renewal comes from a vegetable, not from some clever or brilliant thesis or work of art.  Six years after the \ufb01  rst of the books was introduced, in the summer of 2002, Oprah\u2019s Book Club was put to rest. Did the majority of readers like her choice of books. Oprah\u2019s good friend, writer Maya Angelou, weighed in, stating that she didn\u2019t agree with all the choices, but reading is what matters. Consid-ering the vast amount of publicity given to the dustup Oprah and com-pany had with one of the novelists, Jonathan Franzen, shortly before the decision to give up the book segment of the program, interest in the book selections (among readers, nonreaders, and, in fact, general interest throughout the country) was aroused to a pitch not enjoyed before and could only have served to swell the numbers of the show\u2019s audience.\u201d   The Corrections,  like all of Oprah\u2019s choices, became a best-seller from the moment it was selected for the book club. Because of a public brou-haha with Oprah, Franzen became the most-written-about writer of that 124 OPRAH WINFREYyear. An Oprah choice for the book club was a guaran-tee of a vast readership. In several columns, Yardley reaf\ufb01  rms his belief that Oprah genuinely champions books, but he also hastens to inform readers of his thorough dislike of her television program.\u201d  Book critics have noted that all books anointed by Oprah become best-sellers, bringing in millions of dollars to the author and, of course, the publishing industry. His own book, said Franzen, is in the high art tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to be known as an Oprah Book Club choice.  Sides in the con\ufb02  ict were chosen, but far more were and are on Oprah\u2019s team.\u201d  It is surprising that the Oprah producers in their background checks of participants in their programs overlooked Franzen\u2019s essays and his hostile statements about the shamelessness of television.  Not all of the books Oprah periodically singled out are novels, nor have they been works to be discussed by the club. For a number of years, Oprah also selected non\ufb01  ction publications for themes on her program. The fact is that Oprah\u2019s viewers and readers, in and outside of the studio, have been primarily women.  One tenet of many of these programs, and stressed also through the club\u2014is an Oprah mantra: everyone, male and female, young and old, has to learn for herself or himself that our lives are in our own hands. We cannot bypass either hurtful situations or the person who causes suffering; the person who has given us pain or made us angry, accord-ing to Oprah, must be made aware of the issue. The subject, as in the lessons of the books, is one that resonates in many, many speeches and interviews that Oprah gives, re\ufb02  ecting her own learning curve over the years.  By urging girls and women to refrain from expressing anger or ag-gressiveness, Oprah, in her choice of books, and the numerous pundits on her show point out that our culture has always taught dishonesty; it is behavior that must change.  Whatever led to the demise of the book club, less than 10 months after her decision to abandon the entire concept, Oprah surprised view-ers, the publishing industry, writers, and the book-reading public at the end of February 2003, with an announcement reminiscent of the late comedienne Gilda Radner\u2019s famous line, \u201cNever Mind.\u201d Oprah was reviving her book club. Like almost every act of Oprah\u2019s, it made 126 OPRAH WINFREYnewspaper headlines in both the hard news sections and in the style and entertainment segments of many papers. While being honored with a standing ovation for all she had previously done to inspire an interest in current books, she told the Association of American Publishers she would be returning to the recommendation of books, \u201cbut with a difference. Would the return to classics\u2014in the way that Oprah\u2019s other programs have stimulated viewers\u2014lead to a renewal of interest in literature and literary degrees in colleges and universities. The novel, which tells of the sexual and intellectual frustrations of an unhappily married Victorian woman, is one that, he believes, offers endless pos-sibilities for Oprah\u2019s program. And Oprah has chosen a number of them.\u201d  The club was resurrected a short time after the opening of the Oprah Leadership Academy, when Sidney Poitier\u2019s memoir  The Measure of a Man  was chosen as the \ufb01  rst book in the new club and the 56th choice for the club overall. Oprah described the book as \u201ca spiritual autobi-ography,\u201d an apt term for a work that reports on faith, race, and the in\ufb02 uence of great leaders such as Mandela and Gandhi. In talking on her show about the actor, Oprah called Poitier \u201cone of the greatest men .   It seemed for a time the classics would later have a revived chance for sales with Oprah\u2019s new club undertaking, even if the authors are dead. A world-famous star with Oprah\u2019s international follow-ing can have a major impact on the rejuvenation of reading. When Oprah made the promised announcement of a newly revived book club, stores immediately were deluged by sales.  Oprah soon gave up on the classics and returned to more contem-porary books, which appear to have little or no relationship to each other. Whether Oprah herself chooses the books or members of her staff do so is not made public. Some novelists appear to be favorites; for example, Faulkner\u2019s books have been chosen three times (a some-what surprising choice given that college students\u2014even literature 128 OPRAH WINFREYmajors\u2014are known to need assistance with his works). However, it isn\u2019t surprising that Oprah favors novels of the South. In the mix of choices are some philosophic/religious/spiritual works that surely would not have become best-sellers without the Winfrey imprimatur.  When Oprah resumed the program with her book club, publishers continued to be thrilled with its enormous impact on her following, knowing they\u2014the publishers\u2014had the equivalent of the baseball \ufb01  eld story: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d  But with Oprah\u2019s announcement a few years later that she would be giving up her daily show on network television, gloom reigns today in the publishing industry. Several newspapers have stated openly that Oprah\u2019s \u201cbig switch\u201d will not only change afternoon television but also that book publishers are facing \u201cdoom.  Keeping track of Oprah\u2019s wishes about her book club can be dizzy-ing for her reading followers.\u201d 7   A complete list of the 36 newer choices on Oprah\u2019s soon-to-be-extinct book club books might be compared to an electrocardiogram, as the lines go up and down. Before Oprah\u2019s announcement of the coming change, she had announced a type of appendage to the club, but this was another format, a children\u2019s book club known as the Kids\u2019 Reading List. Oprah\u2019s favorites were included, as were recommendations from experts in the \ufb01  eld of children\u2019s literature.  One writer, unaf\ufb01  liated with any of Oprah\u2019s undertakings, decided that Oprah herself would make a good subject for a children\u2019s book. Called  Oprah: The Little Speaker,  by Carole Boston Weatherford, the trade journal  Publishers Weekly  listed it along with reviews of other chil-dren\u2019s books.\u201d 8   As in the past, some Oprah book choices have made it to the big screen, and Oprah intends to continue that practice. Even while ready-ing herself for the major change to cable television, she and Tom Hanks announced plans to coproduce a movie based on an Oprah book pick,  The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. Even though Oprah will be giving up the book club when she leaves her show, her publication,  O, The Oprah Magazine,  which has been an outstanding success, will continue. The failure rate for start-ups in maga-zines is extremely high; even Oprah\u2019s second venture into magazine publishing,  Oprah At Home,  also came to an end. She was famous, funny, and popular, and she showed  AMERICA READS 131some of the same personality traits of both Oprah and Stewart: strength and determination and staying power with audiences.  For a short period of time, the two stars, O\u2019Donnell and Oprah, seemed to be almost in lockstep: television, magazines, and even books for readers. O\u2019Donnell, though, limited her picks to children\u2019s books and even announced it before her decision to leave her long-running show. Her tell-all book had preceded by a month her exiting her television show. Not as successful as Oprah, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s show was never a rival to Oprah\u2019s\u2014they were in different time slots and on different chan-nels\u2014nor was her decision to retire from  The Rosie O\u2019Donnell Show  the result of competition. 134 OPRAH WINFREY Famous names are expected to sell products and magazines. Signi\ufb01  cantly, despite the fact that advertising is up, news reports have also pointed to somewhat poorer circulation for Oprah\u2019s magazine, which has never been touched by scandals of any sort. Neither Stewart\u2019s nor O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, however, seem to have offered much of a challenge to Oprah\u2019s, even though there was no apparent difference to be found on the magazine racks in stores, inasmuch as some of the largest grocery chains stocked both Stewart\u2019s and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s magazines, sometimes one or the other, but, inexplicably, not Oprah\u2019s for a long time.  Oprah has been a huge factor in the sale of books, a boon to writ-ers, publishers, and bookstores, and even to discount and department stores such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and Target, all better known for food items and other merchandise. Even though some stores did not publicize Oprah\u2019s book choices by distinguishing them from other books, most book stores contained separate racks of Oprah\u2019s book selec-tions. 9  Although those early books are no longer featured, the ones that remained in print still carried the sticker an-nouncing them as an Oprah choice, and once Oprah came back to the business of touting books, no matter the subject, logos and sales went up. In fact, her \ufb01  rst book choice when renewing the club in the summer of 2003, John Steinbeck\u2019s  East of Eden,  quickly rose to the top of the paperback best-seller list.  Oprah\u2019s Book Club choices varied in number, theme, period, author\u2019s roots, and their relationship to Oprah\u2019s other picks. Furthermore, there  AMERICA READS 135were usually signi\ufb01  cant differences between the books chosen for the club, some of which were the work of authors who appeared on Oprah\u2019s show.  Like her television programs and her book clubs\u2014with their enor-mous effect on sales\u2014Oprah\u2019s magazine has been described by writer Patricia Sellers of  Fortune  as \u201cthe most successful magazine launch ever. At a time when other longtime popular women\u2019s magazines have failed,  O, The Oprah Magazine  continues to attract a signi\ufb01  cantly large number of new readers. According to Gayle King, editor-at-large of the magazine, Oprah is obsessive about  O,  overseeing everything, even \u201ccommas\u201d and \u201cexclamation points,\u201d and numerous people have told of the amount of time and work she puts into it. Given the tight control of all Oprah operations, the likelihood 136 OPRAH WINFREYis that further information will not be provided.  From its inception, like many other magazines directed toward women,  O  has followed a pattern of topics known to appeal to a speci\ufb01  c group of women, those said to be more \ufb01  nancially upscale than Oprah\u2019s daily television watchers. Clearly, it is Oprah\u2019s magazine, and at times she seems ubiquitous. Fol-lowing Oprah\u2019s opening essay, \u201cHere We Go,\u201d is an attractive calen-dar for the month, with photographs appropriate to the season.    Each issue of the magazine offers advice of many kinds, much of it in Oprah\u2019s pieces, as well as in the regular monthly columns, and in articles by specialists on a particular subject. Most of the problems of life \ufb01  nd their way eventually onto the beautiful glossy spread, which features a photo of Oprah on the cover as well as an impressive number inside. And, when a particularly beautiful picture of Oprah appears in newspapers and other magazines, it also is printed in  O.  Over a period of several years, through photos alone, a reader may gain insight about the star\u2019s preferences in clothing, from  AMERICA READS 137 Oprah Winfrey stands in front of the cover of the premiere issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine , at a press breakfast in New York, April 17, 2000.  When Oprah was asked why only her picture appears on every cover, her answer was somewhat ingenuous; it was to avoid the neces-sity of making choices of other people every month. In addition to the many pictures of Oprah inside the magazine, the photos are generally of celebrities\u2014perhaps alongside a brief article by or about them. And, although a great many of the arti-cles are about serious matters, there are occasional ones about pleasure, with descriptions and photos of parties Oprah has given. The table settings and linens may be like the products that the star recom-mends in every issue with its soft selling style in the magazine and on 138 OPRAH WINFREYtelevision.  Among the monthly articles, Oprah\u2019s \u201cHere We Go\u201d column in-troduces the theme treated in the majority of articles, most written by women and for women. The view held by readers of Oprah as a woman not only of wisdom but also tenderheartedness underlies advertisements as well as articles.  Every issue features an interview in which Oprah talks to someone famous or important to her, people she knows well or only through rep-utation, but generally those she admires. Some of the interviews have special interest for women, such as the one Oprah had at the home of Elizabeth Edwards when she had just written a book and appeared on the television program but before all the unsavory facts came out about her husband. On occasion, the interviews provide insight into Oprah herself. Oprah always credits her friends for the help they have given her in good times and bad. However, Oprah would undoubt-edly say it is almost impossible to fend off the press\u2014both reporters and television commentators\u2014who search out scandals.\u201d (The Youngs were guests on Oprah\u2019s show, during which Oprah pointedly revealed distaste for the entire matter. When Edwards\u2019s mistress and mother of his child Rielle Hunter was questioned by reporters about revealing photographs and a story in a magazine\u2014not  O, The Oprah Magazine \u2014she was critical of Oprah and her \u201cbelief systems about sex.\u201d In the back-and-forth stories that have been printed, it seems as though only Oprah escapes with her dignity intact.) Later, Oprah had Hunter on the show as a guest, although, to date, Hunter has not written a book. Illness and health are frequent subjects in  O,  and when some particular spark catches the attention of the public, Oprah interviews for the magazine unusual people whose strength and willpower in the face of a ravaging disease inspires others. Inasmuch as it seems the entire world watches Oprah\u2019s weight,  O  provides a forum to reveal her successes and failures, just as she has on her shows for years. (Perhaps this should be part of Oprah\u2019s admonition not to give away your power.)  Beauty, health, and style articles appear in every issue, as well as a monthly self-help piece by Oprah called \u201cSomething to Think About.\u201d 140 OPRAH WINFREYThis turns into a written exercise with the listing of numerous questions that need to be answered by the reader in the spaces provided.  Oprah is a sharer, which is different from relinquishing control.  At various times, Oprah has spoken of her own traumatic introduc-tion to sex. Although what Oprah tells the reader about her early life is no longer new, she identi\ufb01  es with those troubling points underlying teenage sex: the failure of parents to communicate with children, the distances between them, the need girls have for love and acceptance, and the pervasive unhappiness and self-blame resulting from sexual ac-tivities. The fact that Oprah is now middle aged and has dealt with the anguish of her experiences long ago does not alter the similarities  AMERICA READS 141of root causes. In an almost a Words-worthian view, Oprah writes that one must not grieve for what is not given, but take another path. Central messages such as these account for the affection and trust of women worldwide and undoubtedly will continue to be important in the time remaining for  The Oprah Winfrey Show,  the ongoing  O  magazine, and other Oprah undertakings. \u201cThe Oprah Effect,\u201d  Publishers Weekly,  Oct.

During an early trip to Soweto (an acronym for South West Township), Oprah was accompanied by a reporter for a brief visit to the home of some prospective students she had met previously; her visit was to acquaint herself with some sense of their lives. As is typical in many communities, word of Oprah\u2019s visit spread quickly, and outside the house women began \u201cululating the . freedom line of the 1980\u2019s,\u201d but it soon became \u201cViva, Oprah Winfrey.\u201d  In 2003, ground was broken in the town of Henley-on-Klip for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls located south of Johan-nesburg, South Africa. Oprah told a reporter she hoped the school would be \u201ca re\ufb02  ection\u201d of her. Comprising 52 acres on a 28-building campus of dormitories, 144 OPRAH WINFREYan audiovisual center, gym, and tennis courts, it is, as one new student called it, a \u201cfairy tale come true.  Oprah, as well as numerous other Americans who had given dona-tions to the new school, made the 10,000-mile trip to South Africa for the opening event. As Oprah cut the ribbon, the \ufb02  ags of South Africa and the United States were raised simultaneously, bring-ing tears to her eyes. When questioned about the racial backgrounds of the girls and how they were chosen, Oprah stated that all the girls had been interviewed, and among the interviewees were black, white, Asian, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian girls.    All the girls selected personally by Oprah came from poverty but were A students. The maximum family income for any of the chosen girls must be under $700 per month, a great contrast to that of Oprah\u2014also a child of pov-erty, who is now said to be the richest African American of the century.  Very much aware of the conditions of the state-funded schools in South Africa that were established during the years of apartheid, Oprah has sought to overcome, for at least some girls, the crowded, poorly equipped, and even dangerous schools.\u201d  Oprah is one of the most generous philanthropists on the globe, and the recipients of that generosity are the children of the world. Oprah has said, several times, she never had children, and now she can bring up the children of others. talk show host Oprah Winfrey, center front, applauds with schoolgirls in Johannesburg, on August 20, 2006, during her visit to South Africa to interview prospective pupils for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. (AP Photo/Benny Gool)146 OPRAH WINFREY The greatest problem Oprah expected for the students was in the African perception and treatment of women in a culture that does not value them, and Oprah \ufb01  nds it vital that those girls, as well as other fe-males, become conscious of \u201ctheir own power and possibility.\u201d 2  Winfrey frequently says \u201cshe wants to nurture kids.  Oprah wants the girls to have the happy childhood she never had, with education as the way forward. Apparently, Oprah\u2019s support of candidate Obama did not interfere with Simmons\u2019s gift to her academy. However, Oprah\u2019s major philanthropic interest is said to be Africa, where Oprah and her Angel Network have contributed a large amount of money to 40 or more organizations, many of them in Africa,  SCHOOLS 147though not nearly the amount given through her personal foundation. 3  When Oprah had Cher on her program several years ago, the conversation turned to angels, at which point Oprah wondered whether there were any black angels, because she had never seen any. All of these have become part of The Oprah Collection in which the only work without wings is a \ufb01  gure of Rosa Parks, whom Oprah calls \u201cher personal angel.\u201d  The Oprah Winfrey Operating Foundation is the organization that is responsible for her Leadership Academy in Gauteng, South Africa. To people who question why Oprah built her academy in South Africa, her response is that she felt it was insuf\ufb01  cient to always give money to charities. A number of bloggers were critical of her choices, complain-ing that Oprah was seeking glory for herself with her efforts in Africa. 148 OPRAH WINFREY Furthermore, domestically, Oprah continues to give funds to some of her U. It has been written that Oprah\u2019s leader-ship academy was modeled after Miss Porter\u2019s school. An emotional Oprah talked of the experiences the children had before they came to the school, and the girls themselves told stories of their lives of deprivation. Even though the school has outstanding facili-ties and provides the girls with every opportunity to learn about music and the arts, Oprah has tried to enlarge their experiences in a world unfamiliar to them. Because they were studying acting at the academy, Oprah wanted them to attend an actual theater. Although Oprah refers to the girls at her academy as her daughters, Ma-donna clearly wanted a more personal relationship with the children, and she made news with her adoption of a baby boy from Malawi. Oprah\u2019s outlay 150 OPRAH WINFREYwas $40 million before her academy opened in 2007. Typical of that money-raising activity was an auction of 150 pieces of Oprah\u2019s clothing in early 2010. If a less famous person than Oprah were selling clothing on eBay, it would not be news covered by journalists, but the elegance of the clothing, as columnist Amanda Pendolino wrote, was the typical \u201cclassy and gorgeous\u201d Oprah style: a Carolina Herrera dress of purple; two evening bags\u2014one a Bottega Veneta and one a quilted Chanel; a pair of red suede open-toe heels by Prada; satin pumps by Jimmy Choo; a pair of pointed-toe Prada boots; and on and on.  Oprah has been inspired by many people, but one of her favorite memories is of a Christmas when her mother warned the children to expect nothing, yet three nuns arrived with food for the family and toys for the children, including a doll for Oprah.  Oprah\u2019s life is so busy, and not everything is reported, even though it often seems that the press follows her every move. When Americans criticize Oprah for her largess to African schools, it may be that the press is less aware or less interested in her charitable work at home. For example, a local paper in Newark, New Jersey, the  Star-Ledger,  reported a $500,000 gift that Oprah made in 2009 to St. The mayor, who is credited for his vision and constant efforts in the city of Newark and who founded the organization Newark Now, met Oprah through Gayle King. In thank-ing Oprah in a public statement, Booker spoke of the large numbers\u2014 SCHOOLS 151hundreds and hundreds\u2014of families in his city who are being helped because of Oprah\u2019s commitment to serving others.  In 2007, another dimension had been added to Oprah\u2019s philan-thropy: a new program called Oprah\u2019s Ambassadors, which was a combi-nation partnership between the Angel Network and Free the Children. cities have bene\ufb01  tted as well, even though there is not the same cachet attached to their names as Oprah\u2019s Leadership Academy. It also has been the recipient of million-dollar gifts from Oprah\u2019s foun-dations. Money is raised 152 OPRAH WINFREYnot only by donations from individuals and corporations but also fund-raising entertainment.  Oprah\u2019s engagement with the various leadership schools has many facets, including activities to further the training of members of the staffs. A Cape Town young woman who had graduated with a degree in psychology became the single candidate from the continent to be given an Oprah scholarship to New York University, where she would study for a master\u2019s degree. Even though Oprah is often called the most in\ufb02  uential person\u2014or one of the most in\ufb02  uential people\u2014in the world, not everything becomes wine and roses. Although Oprah is commended by millions of admirers, others take note of her failures. When she failed to \ufb01  nd work in Philadelphia after she\u2019d lost her position in Africa, she claimed that the scandal and Oprah\u2019s remarks about her were the source of her problem.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s lawyers asked for dismissal of the case on two grounds: \ufb01  rst, that Oprah had not said anything libelous; and second, that federal court in Philadelphia was the incorrect jurisdiction for a hearing, inas-much as Oprah does not live in Philadelphia, nor does she have busi-ness there. The newspapers were enjoying the notoriety that Oprah would bring to the city; the  New York Post  stated, it would resemble \u201ca visit from royalty\u201d because of the expected crowds. 154 OPRAH WINFREY As usual, bloggers wrote pro and con remarks about the event, but, typically, Oprah\u2019s staff released no further information about the mat-ter, and that was the end. But bloggers, who are often venomous in their anonymous comments, accused Oprah of lying and several called her \u201cDoperah. Needless to say, the case received wide publicity because of Oprah\u2019s fame.\u201d  Oprah herself did not attend the African trial and would not dis-cuss it in speci\ufb01  cs, although she had sent a U. Those comments Oprah did make were about reaction to the events that disrupted life at the school. Oprah apologized to the parents of the girls, speaking not only of her feelings but also her concern that she had disappointed them. Although Oprah asked the girl to return, also meeting for two hours with the family to discuss the situation, the girl preferred to return to her former school. At the end of that school year, Oprah gave what she called a celebra-tion dinner; others called it a \u201cpost-scandal celebration\u201d; some named it an \u201cend of the year party\u201d; and still others said it was a \u201choliday cel-ebration.\u201d Oprah, in a traditional African dress, was greeted warmly by the children. However, despite their presence and Oprah\u2019s public praise of the girl, the girl continued to refuse to return to the academy.  Oprah\u2019s unhappiness about the situation was clear in the few public statements she made.  In 2008, Oprah cautiously began the search for a new headmistress for the academy, choosing the managing director of the organization Search Associates to head the recruitment for someone with interna-tional experience. Oprah, who likes to be in control of most of her projects, showed a strong interest in \ufb01  nding an Australian teacher.  Perhaps her interest in Australia had been sparked by an invitation Oprah received to visit an Aboriginal community in Australia where a festival was to be held. Even though Oprah could not attend the central Arn-hem Land arts festival, she did invite a Cape York Aborigine, Tania Major, to be a keynote speaker at the academy. Major had been chosen as the 2007 Australian Youth of the Year; undoubtedly, Oprah\u2019s interest in indigenous people and culture had been a factor in the invitation.  SCHOOLS 157 When Oprah was interviewed by the  Cape Argus  newspaper in Af-rica, she spoke of mistakes she\u2019d made at the academy, in being too protective of the girls and of appearing to keep them isolated.   Washington Post  columnist Eugene Robinson wrote two columns critical of Oprah\u2019s involvement in building schools in Africa instead of in the United States.\u201d He makes several points about contradictions in Oprah\u2019s statements about teenagers in the United States and Africa, but his emphasis is on the needs of poor school-age children in the United States. 7  In a  Post  column written 10 months later, Robinson scolds Oprah: \u201cThis Isn\u2019t About Oprah.\u201d At the end of his column, however, he offers an olive branch, saying Oprah does know the most \u201csacred trust\u201d is in \u201ccaring for other people\u2019s children.\u201d 8   A blogger, who gave his name and spoke of his country as South Africa, pointed out that he was not being unpatriotic when he was 158 OPRAH WINFREYcritical of Oprah\u2019s undertaking. What he writes is both a caution to those who would naively offer help to Africa without knowing the dif-\ufb01  culties and praise of Oprah for her efforts. 9  The writer compares himself in his \ufb01  rst days in Zambia to what Oprah felt when she went to South Africa: \u201cPure joy and compassion.\u201d However, he questions anyone\u2019s desire to provide \u201ca Western solution to an African problem\u201d and, in particular, Oprah\u2019s plans to give the girls all kinds of luxuries they have never known but which will make \u201cleaders\u201d of them. Can Oprah succeed where others have failed.  SCHOOLS 159 Some Africans have nothing but praise for Oprah\u2019s undertakings and urge her to continue them in the hopes that the children\u2019s lives will be better and that the children will be the leaders and educators of the future. In the academy there is on display a painting of Oprah carrying a child. It had been given to her by a woman in Texas who wanted to bring Oprah\u2019s atten-tion to those who struggle with terrible diseases.  In every issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine,  Oprah ends with a sig-nature column, \u201cWhat I Know for Sure. Using what she had learned from Eckhart Tolle\u2019s book,  The Power of Now,  Oprah decided she would deal with the situations as they arise.\u201d A determined Oprah was ready to start again.

As is typical in many communities, word of Oprah\u2019s visit spread quickly, and outside the house women began \u201cululating the . freedom line of the 1980\u2019s,\u201d but it soon became \u201cViva, Oprah Winfrey.\u201d  In 2003, ground was broken in the town of Henley-on-Klip for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls located south of Johan-nesburg, South Africa. Oprah told a reporter she hoped the school would be \u201ca re\ufb02  ection\u201d of her.\u201d The fairy tale is the result of Oprah\u2019s earlier promise to Mandela. As Oprah cut the ribbon, the \ufb02  ags of South Africa and the United States were raised simultaneously, bring-ing tears to her eyes. When questioned about the racial backgrounds of the girls and how they were chosen, Oprah stated that all the girls had been interviewed, and among the interviewees were black, white, Asian, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian girls.    All the girls selected personally by Oprah came from poverty but were A students. The maximum family income for any of the chosen girls must be under $700 per month, a great contrast to that of Oprah\u2014also a child of pov-erty, who is now said to be the richest African American of the century.  Very much aware of the conditions of the state-funded schools in South Africa that were established during the years of apartheid, Oprah has sought to overcome, for at least some girls, the crowded, poorly equipped, and even dangerous schools.\u201d  Oprah is one of the most generous philanthropists on the globe, and the recipients of that generosity are the children of the world. Oprah has said, several times, she never had children, and now she can bring up the children of others. talk show host Oprah Winfrey, center front, applauds with schoolgirls in Johannesburg, on August 20, 2006, during her visit to South Africa to interview prospective pupils for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. (AP Photo/Benny Gool)146 OPRAH WINFREY The greatest problem Oprah expected for the students was in the African perception and treatment of women in a culture that does not value them, and Oprah \ufb01  nds it vital that those girls, as well as other fe-males, become conscious of \u201ctheir own power and possibility.  Oprah wants the girls to have the happy childhood she never had, with education as the way forward. Apparently, Oprah\u2019s support of candidate Obama did not interfere with Simmons\u2019s gift to her academy.  Oprah established three charities with gifts estimated to surpass $200 million in 2007, and this amount undoubtedly grows larger each year. However, Oprah\u2019s major philanthropic interest is said to be Africa, where Oprah and her Angel Network have contributed a large amount of money to 40 or more organizations, many of them in Africa,  SCHOOLS 147though not nearly the amount given through her personal foundation. 3  When Oprah had Cher on her program several years ago, the conversation turned to angels, at which point Oprah wondered whether there were any black angels, because she had never seen any. All of these have become part of The Oprah Collection in which the only work without wings is a \ufb01  gure of Rosa Parks, whom Oprah calls \u201cher personal angel.\u201d  The Oprah Winfrey Operating Foundation is the organization that is responsible for her Leadership Academy in Gauteng, South Africa. To people who question why Oprah built her academy in South Africa, her response is that she felt it was insuf\ufb01  cient to always give money to charities. A number of bloggers were critical of her choices, complain-ing that Oprah was seeking glory for herself with her efforts in Africa. However, Oprah\u2019s response to such remarks was that she wanted some-thing more tangible than writing \u201ccheck after check. 148 OPRAH WINFREY Furthermore, domestically, Oprah continues to give funds to some of her U. An emotional Oprah talked of the experiences the children had before they came to the school, and the girls themselves told stories of their lives of deprivation. Even though the school has outstanding facili-ties and provides the girls with every opportunity to learn about music and the arts, Oprah has tried to enlarge their experiences in a world unfamiliar to them. Because they were studying acting at the academy, Oprah wanted them to attend an actual theater. Although Oprah refers to the girls at her academy as her daughters, Ma-donna clearly wanted a more personal relationship with the children, and she made news with her adoption of a baby boy from Malawi. Oprah\u2019s outlay 150 OPRAH WINFREYwas $40 million before her academy opened in 2007. Typical of that money-raising activity was an auction of 150 pieces of Oprah\u2019s clothing in early 2010. With a staff member of her magazine, Adam Glassman, Oprah selected 150 items from her wardrobe to sell on the online eBay. If a less famous person than Oprah were selling clothing on eBay, it would not be news covered by journalists, but the elegance of the clothing, as columnist Amanda Pendolino wrote, was the typical \u201cclassy and gorgeous\u201d Oprah style: a Carolina Herrera dress of purple; two evening bags\u2014one a Bottega Veneta and one a quilted Chanel; a pair of red suede open-toe heels by Prada; satin pumps by Jimmy Choo; a pair of pointed-toe Prada boots; and on and on.  Oprah has been inspired by many people, but one of her favorite memories is of a Christmas when her mother warned the children to expect nothing, yet three nuns arrived with food for the family and toys for the children, including a doll for Oprah.  Oprah\u2019s life is so busy, and not everything is reported, even though it often seems that the press follows her every move. For example, a local paper in Newark, New Jersey, the  Star-Ledger,  reported a $500,000 gift that Oprah made in 2009 to St. In thank-ing Oprah in a public statement, Booker spoke of the large numbers\u2014 SCHOOLS 151hundreds and hundreds\u2014of families in his city who are being helped because of Oprah\u2019s commitment to serving others.  In 2007, another dimension had been added to Oprah\u2019s philan-thropy: a new program called Oprah\u2019s Ambassadors, which was a combi-nation partnership between the Angel Network and Free the Children.  Edgewood High School in New Jersey was chosen as an Oprah Am-bassador School for 2008\u20132009. cities have bene\ufb01  tted as well, even though there is not the same cachet attached to their names as Oprah\u2019s Leadership Academy. It also has been the recipient of million-dollar gifts from Oprah\u2019s foun-dations. Money is raised 152 OPRAH WINFREYnot only by donations from individuals and corporations but also fund-raising entertainment.  Oprah\u2019s engagement with the various leadership schools has many facets, including activities to further the training of members of the staffs. A Cape Town young woman who had graduated with a degree in psychology became the single candidate from the continent to be given an Oprah scholarship to New York University, where she would study for a master\u2019s degree. Even though Oprah is often called the most in\ufb02  uential person\u2014or one of the most in\ufb02  uential people\u2014in the world, not everything becomes wine and roses. Although Oprah is commended by millions of admirers, others take note of her failures. When she failed to \ufb01  nd work in Philadelphia after she\u2019d lost her position in Africa, she claimed that the scandal and Oprah\u2019s remarks about her were the source of her problem.\u201d  Oprah\u2019s lawyers asked for dismissal of the case on two grounds: \ufb01  rst, that Oprah had not said anything libelous; and second, that federal court in Philadelphia was the incorrect jurisdiction for a hearing, inas-much as Oprah does not live in Philadelphia, nor does she have busi-ness there. The newspapers were enjoying the notoriety that Oprah would bring to the city; the  New York Post  stated, it would resemble \u201ca visit from royalty\u201d because of the expected crowds. However, after all the hullabaloo, the case came to an abrupt end once Oprah settled the suit when\u2014according to the news reports\u2014the two women \u201cmet . 154 OPRAH WINFREY As usual, bloggers wrote pro and con remarks about the event, but, typically, Oprah\u2019s staff released no further information about the mat-ter, and that was the end. But bloggers, who are often venomous in their anonymous comments, accused Oprah of lying and several called her \u201cDoperah. Needless to say, the case received wide publicity because of Oprah\u2019s fame.\u201d  Oprah herself did not attend the African trial and would not dis-cuss it in speci\ufb01  cs, although she had sent a U. Those comments Oprah did make were about reaction to the events that disrupted life at the school. Oprah apologized to the parents of the girls, speaking not only of her feelings but also her concern that she had disappointed them. Although Oprah asked the girl to return, also meeting for two hours with the family to discuss the situation, the girl preferred to return to her former school. The father expressed gratitude for the opportunity Oprah had given his child, but the girl did not return to the academy.\u201d Oprah, in a traditional African dress, was greeted warmly by the children. However, despite their presence and Oprah\u2019s public praise of the girl, the girl continued to refuse to return to the academy.  Oprah\u2019s unhappiness about the situation was clear in the few public statements she made.  In 2008, Oprah cautiously began the search for a new headmistress for the academy, choosing the managing director of the organization Search Associates to head the recruitment for someone with interna-tional experience. Oprah, who likes to be in control of most of her projects, showed a strong interest in \ufb01  nding an Australian teacher.  Perhaps her interest in Australia had been sparked by an invitation Oprah received to visit an Aboriginal community in Australia where a festival was to be held. Even though Oprah could not attend the central Arn-hem Land arts festival, she did invite a Cape York Aborigine, Tania Major, to be a keynote speaker at the academy. Major had been chosen as the 2007 Australian Youth of the Year; undoubtedly, Oprah\u2019s interest in indigenous people and culture had been a factor in the invitation. Although Oprah has used the phrase \u201cAha moment\u201d in her magazine for several years without any problem, in 2009 the well-known insurance company, Mutual of Omaha, \ufb01  led for a trademark called \u201cOf\ufb01  cial sponsors of the aha moment. 7  In a  Post  column written 10 months later, Robinson scolds Oprah: \u201cThis Isn\u2019t About Oprah.\u201d At the end of his column, however, he offers an olive branch, saying Oprah does know the most \u201csacred trust\u201d is in \u201ccaring for other people\u2019s children.\u201d 8   A blogger, who gave his name and spoke of his country as South Africa, pointed out that he was not being unpatriotic when he was 158 OPRAH WINFREYcritical of Oprah\u2019s undertaking. What he writes is both a caution to those who would naively offer help to Africa without knowing the dif-\ufb01  culties and praise of Oprah for her efforts. 9  The writer compares himself in his \ufb01  rst days in Zambia to what Oprah felt when she went to South Africa: \u201cPure joy and compassion.\u201d However, he questions anyone\u2019s desire to provide \u201ca Western solution to an African problem\u201d and, in particular, Oprah\u2019s plans to give the girls all kinds of luxuries they have never known but which will make \u201cleaders\u201d of them. Can Oprah succeed where others have failed.  SCHOOLS 159 Some Africans have nothing but praise for Oprah\u2019s undertakings and urge her to continue them in the hopes that the children\u2019s lives will be better and that the children will be the leaders and educators of the future. In the academy there is on display a painting of Oprah carrying a child. It had been given to her by a woman in Texas who wanted to bring Oprah\u2019s atten-tion to those who struggle with terrible diseases.  In every issue of  O, The Oprah Magazine,  Oprah ends with a sig-nature column, \u201cWhat I Know for Sure. Using what she had learned from Eckhart Tolle\u2019s book,  The Power of Now,  Oprah decided she would deal with the situations as they arise.\u201d A determined Oprah was ready to start again.

Oprah\u2019s focus on healthy bodies and minds helped make her a top player in television, radio, and publishing, but it has been her unplanned as well as her planned engagements that revealed the extent of her in\ufb02  u-ence on consumers. Oprah\u2019s involvement in revealing the dangers of eating beef that could be tainted brought on a \ufb01  restorm from all segments of the industry: the economy was affected, cattlemen were enraged, lobbyists were perturbed, and, in Amarillo, Texas, the industry\u2019s lawyers brought suit against Oprah. Lines of people and 162 OPRAH WINFREYautomobiles\u2014sporting pro and con bumper stickers\u2014\ufb01  lled the streets, in addition to fans, photographers, and imported preachers. However, the case was soon forgotten; restaurants soon took orders for beef; there have been fewer details of Oprah\u2019s eating habits; her magazine\u2019s food section is not tak-ing a position about good and bad food; and the United States appar-ently is back to eating hamburgers.

Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s. Like others who have struggled with obesity, Oprah has sought the magic pill or diet. In 2008, she went on a vegan detox plan, and at the same time her Web site of-fered a healthy menu. A Canadian reporter chided her about the \u201c21 day cleansing diet.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Also, the magazine will continue to include recom-mendations about diets and related topics. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. Oprah and Dr. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor. Oprah has told him she wants the show to focus on people, and that is what he is doing. Phil McGraw, \ufb01  nancial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in New York, May 7, 2010. (AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. Weight seems to be the leader in the number of times a subject is introduced; Oz showed a gastric bypass \ufb01  lm on one of Oprah\u2019s programs and continues to speak of food as \u201ca socially accept-able addiction\u201d that must be dealt with psychologically. The success of the best-seller,  You on a Diet,  was attributed \u201cin no small part,\u201d said a reporter, to Oz\u2019s good looks and appearance in scrubs on Oprah\u2019s show. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. But no matter how wise his philosophy and training have been, and even though Greene\u2019s  The Best Life Diet  received the highest score in the 2007  Consumer Reports  rating of diet books, without his association with Oprah his considerable successes probably would not have occurred. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. At times she endured a formidable program combining dieting and workouts with Greene as her personal trainer. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God.  The book is Roth\u2019s seventh, and coincidentally she lists seven guidelines for better eating. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life. Greene\u2019s focus was on \u201cemotional eating,\u201d a subject well known to Oprah, who made it a frequent subject on her show over the years.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. She spent years in her search for the magic bullet of weight loss, carrying on an obsessive search for the holy grail of the body beautiful. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue.  Not all cultures obsess in the same way: white South Africa, for in-stance, a country in which racial issues remain a signi\ufb01  cant matter, seems more interested in her weight than in her race, which might be attrib-utable to Oprah\u2019s former preoccupations but also to the popularity of her magazine and programs in that country.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better.\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.

A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either.

Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. Oprah and Dr. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. Oprah coauthored Greene\u2019s first book, and he later became one of the hosts on Oprah Radio XM, which formerly had been  Oprah and Friends. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d . Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following.  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)180 OPRAH WINFREYstatement that those to whom much is given have the obligation to give much to others, and her intention is just that. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.

Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.

LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah.\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.

It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration.

With the title \u201cWinfrey Launches Rehab Show,\u201d the announcement gives the debut date as January 11 for the eight-episode program that will focus on issues about food and eating disorders.\u201d  Anyone who has the least familiarity with Oprah\u2019s show or maga-zines knows about her lifelong battle with food and weight and her challenges over the years with one diet or another. Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s. Like others who have struggled with obesity, Oprah has sought the magic pill or diet.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Oz helped 168 OPRAH WINFREYhim shave off the mustache, described as a \u201ctrademark soup strainer,\u201d he\u2019d worn for more than 40 years. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.  Advertising Age  made the point that Oprah\u2019s friend Gayle King (who also is editor-at-large for  O, The Oprah Magazine ) was given Dove\u2019s \ufb01  rst Real Beauty Award. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following.  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. Lofton, however, tempers her remarks by \ufb01  rst praising Oprah\u2019s philanthropy, but then \ufb01  nds it is linked to commercialism. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.\u201d Oprah \u201cis a corporation\u201d using \u201ca religious idiom to amazing effect.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)180 OPRAH WINFREYstatement that those to whom much is given have the obligation to give much to others, and her intention is just that. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. Since their early meetings, Oprah and King have prospered, following much the same path, and the gossipy media enjoy printing information about the expensive gifts of homes Oprah has given to King\u2014one home in Connecticut for $3. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.

Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish. In reports of a tragic happen-ing in 2005, newspapers referred to the man responsible, James Arthur Ray, as an \u201cOprah approved self-help guru.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.\u201d The authors\u2019 intention is to show that Oprah\u2019s spirituality doesn\u2019t \ufb01  t their evangelical beliefs.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. But Oprah, in contrast, he claims, \u201cmocks\u201d such views in favor of \u201cself-adoration.\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God. [that] is over Oprah,\u201d suggesting they too will die because of her teachings. If the reader won-ders what it is that Oprah has unleashed upon the world, her critics \ufb01  nd endless examples. The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d When  Newsweek  published a lengthy ar-ticle berating her in\ufb02  uence on the public, 14  several physicians wrote letters of support for that view, one saying she supports bad medicine in her role, creating the \u201cOprah-\ufb01  cation of medicine.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration. (Was one or more of the critics thinking of Chauncey in referring to a report that \u201ceven Oprah\u201d [often.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 189 Although it was Oprah who made Tolle famous, one might question the idea that she alone is entirely responsible for his overwhelming success. 16   At times it seems that Oprah does nothing but work, travel for busi-ness, give talks, appear on shows other than her own, and on and on. Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

Oprah\u2019s focus on healthy bodies and minds helped make her a top player in television, radio, and publishing, but it has been her unplanned as well as her planned engagements that revealed the extent of her in\ufb02  u-ence on consumers. Oprah\u2019s involvement in revealing the dangers of eating beef that could be tainted brought on a \ufb01  restorm from all segments of the industry: the economy was affected, cattlemen were enraged, lobbyists were perturbed, and, in Amarillo, Texas, the industry\u2019s lawyers brought suit against Oprah. Lines of people and 162 OPRAH WINFREYautomobiles\u2014sporting pro and con bumper stickers\u2014\ufb01  lled the streets, in addition to fans, photographers, and imported preachers.    Oprah won her case, not only initially but also on appeal, with the people closest to her giving moral support. However, the case was soon forgotten; restaurants soon took orders for beef; there have been fewer details of Oprah\u2019s eating habits; her magazine\u2019s food section is not tak-ing a position about good and bad food; and the United States appar-ently is back to eating hamburgers.

Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s. Like others who have struggled with obesity, Oprah has sought the magic pill or diet. Like everything else that Oprah does, it was news around the world, with enthusiastic response to the plan, at least tem-porarily.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Some programs will be partly original shows, and some will focus on Oprah. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests.  Some media experts are concerned that there will be saturation on the new network because of the dip in Oprah\u2019s ratings that has taken place in the past decade or so. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Hazlett quotes Oprah\u2019s statement about her \u201call-time favorite\u201d cover, the August 2004 issue, which showed her on a beach, where it was chilly enough for the photographer and crew to follow her with heaters \u2014 obviously it wasn\u2019t August for the shooting. Outstanding books also get a nod in the same anniversary issue, with 10 of them \u201cthat rocked Oprah\u2019s decade. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned.  On one of Oprah\u2019s shows featuring gays and sometimes their family members, Berkus was included. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion. Berkus has been signi\ufb01  cant in  O, The Oprah Magazine,   but now that the decision has been made to shift the taping of the daily Oprah television program to New York, the future is cloudy for Chicagoans such as Berkus, even though the announcement was made that Harpo, with its many branches, will remain in the city, and Oprah has opened another shop in Chicago, indicating she is not cutting entirely her con-nection to Chicago.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health. Whether it is his visibility in so many of Oprah\u2019s undertakings or his audacious and sometimes combative daily television show that is the source of the negative assessments, his ar-ticles \ufb01  t into an established pattern of most women\u2019s magazines.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. A num-ber of blogs and various comments also appeared, such as the recom-mendation that the marriage counselor get marriage counseling, and some papers reported Oprah\u2019s displeasure about the stories. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Oz helped 168 OPRAH WINFREYhim shave off the mustache, described as a \u201ctrademark soup strainer,\u201d he\u2019d worn for more than 40 years. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times. Oprah has told him she wants the show to focus on people, and that is what he is doing. Phil McGraw, \ufb01  nancial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in New York, May 7, 2010. (AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. Weight seems to be the leader in the number of times a subject is introduced; Oz showed a gastric bypass \ufb01  lm on one of Oprah\u2019s programs and continues to speak of food as \u201ca socially accept-able addiction\u201d that must be dealt with psychologically. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. Oprah coauthored Greene\u2019s first book, and he later became one of the hosts on Oprah Radio XM, which formerly had been  Oprah and Friends.  His show airs on Saturdays, with other Oprah favorites hosting on other days: best friend Gayle King, mentor Maya Angelou, writer Lisa Kogan, sex therapist Dr. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life. Greene\u2019s focus was on \u201cemotional eating,\u201d a subject well known to Oprah, who made it a frequent subject on her show over the years.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue.  Not all cultures obsess in the same way: white South Africa, for in-stance, a country in which racial issues remain a signi\ufb01  cant matter, seems more interested in her weight than in her race, which might be attrib-utable to Oprah\u2019s former preoccupations but also to the popularity of her magazine and programs in that country. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.  Advertising Age  made the point that Oprah\u2019s friend Gayle King (who also is editor-at-large for  O, The Oprah Magazine ) was given Dove\u2019s \ufb01  rst Real Beauty Award.  Oprah\u2019s Harpo Productions attempts to hold tight control on all things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Oprah stopped attending tradi-tional churches and wanted to separate herself from the angry messages of preachers such as Wright. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following.\u201d Oprah, said Crouch, is \u201cthe Mother Courage of talk television .  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth. Nonetheless, some members of the religious right have attacked Oprah\u2019s programs and in\ufb02  uence on her \u201cstudents,\u201d calling her \u201cthe devil.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. He disagrees with Tolle and faults Oprah for \u201cundercutting Christianity.\u201d 9   With all the negative publicity, Oprah became defensive about her choices of Tolle\u2019s books for her classes and the classes themselves, point-edly stating they were not about religion but rather to help people ex-plore their consciousness. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. Lofton, however, tempers her remarks by \ufb01  rst praising Oprah\u2019s philanthropy, but then \ufb01  nds it is linked to commercialism. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.) According to Lofton, Oprah\u2019s \u201cimperative is not to save souls .\u201d Oprah \u201cis a corporation\u201d using \u201ca religious idiom to amazing effect.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.    Pastor Hooper at the Religious Science Church of the Desert Spiri-tual Center wrote that Oprah \u201cis a mighty force . The Reverend Hooper builds his lectures around themes that Oprah stresses, particularly the belief that there is no one way, \u201cno one .\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d.  A month after Reverend Wright\u2019s intemperate remarks, Oprah started the Soul Series, on XM radio online. For 10 weeks, Oprah and author Eckhart Tolle taught the material from his book,  A New Earth,  the  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 17761st book featured on Oprah\u2019s Book Club as well as her choice for their summer reading. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

Calling Oprah \u201cthe Jezebel of Prophecy,\u201d a documentary \ufb01  lmmaker advertising his availability for interviews (but not interviewed by Oprah) produced a DVD,  Hebrew or the So-Called Negro,  warning of her destruc-tive effect.\u201d Shown on YouTube, thus guaranteeing a wide audience, it describes Oprah as de-nying major beliefs of Christianity.\u201d Coppenger moves from God\u2019s indignation to his own, faulting Oprah for having her own agenda, which includes the unacceptable \u201ccohabiting with Stedman Graham.\u201d  Some people who are interested in Oprah\u2019s love life report that she and Graham live together, and others claim that the two have separated. A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Several years ago, the tabloid press was reporting on every sighting, but not so now, except for infrequent\u2014and perhaps questionable\u2014statements that Graham has other love interests, and so does Oprah, or that Graham has moved out of the apartment the two shared. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)180 OPRAH WINFREYstatement that those to whom much is given have the obligation to give much to others, and her intention is just that. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King. Although King shares many, many activities with Oprah and has become a prominent \ufb01  gure on her own in television and radio, as well as in Oprah\u2019s publications, both women scorn the implications of the press, and both have also stated there is no shame in anyone\u2019s being gay.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. Since their early meetings, Oprah and King have prospered, following much the same path, and the gossipy media enjoy printing information about the expensive gifts of homes Oprah has given to King\u2014one home in Connecticut for $3. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.

Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. Without Oprah\u2019s golden touch, though, and no interview, the book sales were weak.  Another politician\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Edwards, also produced a per-sonal story, called  Reconciliation,  which she talked about on Oprah\u2019s show. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish. In reports of a tragic happen-ing in 2005, newspapers referred to the man responsible, James Arthur Ray, as an \u201cOprah approved self-help guru.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray. The saying that \u201call publicity is good publicity\u201d clearly did not apply to Oprah\u2019s part in the tragedy, but it quickly disappeared from the news cycle, and the reason for that remains unknown.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. When questioned, though, about Oprah\u2019s refusal to autho-rize the book, Kelley states she was not interested in going that route. But Oprah\u2019s less scandalous involvement in spiritual studies and events during the past few years has brought about more sermons, reports, praise, and condemnation than anything else to date. It re-mains to be seen what the Kelley effect does to Oprah\u2019s image, and if there is damage, how long the aftershocks linger and whether there will be any tie-in to the spiritual part of the star\u2019s life.  For several years, numerous religious \ufb01  gures have attacked every-thing Oprah has said or done about religion and spirituality. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy.\u201d They do not accuse Oprah of being anti-Christian but anti-Bible. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.\u201d The authors\u2019 intention is to show that Oprah\u2019s spirituality doesn\u2019t \ufb01  t their evangelical beliefs.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. But Oprah, in contrast, he claims, \u201cmocks\u201d such views in favor of \u201cself-adoration. descended from Adam and Eve,\u201d and Oprah, as evolving \u201cby chance .\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.\u201d 12   If such harsh condemnation isn\u2019t suf\ufb01  cient to turn admirers away from Oprah, it is not for lack of critics. A Web site named Jesus-is-Savior speaks of Oprah as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in the world,\u201d and the author of a self-published book,  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid  (a title that refers to the tragic deaths in 1978 of hundreds of people who had belonged to a cult) warns readers of the \u201cspell . [that] is over Oprah,\u201d suggesting they too will die because of her teachings. If the reader won-ders what it is that Oprah has unleashed upon the world, her critics \ufb01  nd endless examples. One person, Jennifer Simon, writing on a site called AlterNet, states she knows that her remarks will anger Oprah\u2019s \u201cmob of followers. The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d When  Newsweek  published a lengthy ar-ticle berating her in\ufb02  uence on the public, 14  several physicians wrote letters of support for that view, one saying she supports bad medicine in her role, creating the \u201cOprah-\ufb01  cation of medicine.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration.

Whichever the interpretation, Friedman is undoubtedly contemptuous of both Oprah and Tolle.

Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

Louis Bayard, review of  Oprah: A Biography,  by Kitty Kelley,  Washington Post,  Book World, 15 Apr.", "Oprah_Views_2010": " Chapter 6  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY  Throughout the years, Oprah has hosted many shows on topics that also \ufb01  ll central roles in all magazines, not only hers: food\u2014goo d and bad; weight\u2014healthy and unhealthy; physical \ufb01  tness; spiritual happiness; and emotional strength.  Oprah\u2019s focus on healthy bodies and minds helped make her a top player in television, radio, and publishing, but it has been her unplanned as well as her planned engagements that revealed the extent of her in\ufb02  u-ence on consumers. Oprah\u2019s involvement in revealing the dangers of eating beef that could be tainted brought on a \ufb01  restorm from all segments of the industry: the economy was affected, cattlemen were enraged, lobbyists were perturbed, and, in Amarillo, Texas, the industry\u2019s lawyers brought suit against Oprah. Lines of people and 162 OPRAH WINFREYautomobiles\u2014sporting pro and con bumper stickers\u2014\ufb01  lled the streets, in addition to fans, photographers, and imported preachers.    Oprah won her case, not only initially but also on appeal, with the people closest to her giving moral support. However, the case was soon forgotten; restaurants soon took orders for beef; there have been fewer details of Oprah\u2019s eating habits; her magazine\u2019s food section is not tak-ing a position about good and bad food; and the United States appar-ently is back to eating hamburgers. Although, more recently, the matter of tainted eggs has been in the headlines, Oprah did not discuss it on her show.  Oprah\u2019s current campaign is about having people pledge to refrain from using a cell phone or texting while driving. They, and others who Oprah Winfrey reacts to a fan reaching out to her as she leaves the federal courthouse after jury selection in Amarillo, Texas, January 20, 1998. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 163might be affected by her in\ufb02  uence, reportedly are fearful of resisting her decree; as \u201cJust Plain Darren\u201d of East Coast Radio writes, \u201cYou don\u2019t mess with Oprah.\u201d  As Oprah began her newest venture, much about the future was un-known, except for the news releases that came out\u2014and most provided the same information. However, much has been also going on behind the scenes while Oprah along with her staff and colleagues deter-mined the direction OWN would take.\u201d  Anyone who has the least familiarity with Oprah\u2019s show or maga-zines knows about her lifelong battle with food and weight and her challenges over the years with one diet or another. Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s. Like others who have struggled with obesity, Oprah has sought the magic pill or diet. In 2008, she went on a vegan detox plan, and at the same time her Web site of-fered a healthy menu. Like everything else that Oprah does, it was news around the world, with enthusiastic response to the plan, at least tem-porarily.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Few details have been given thus far, but it has been announced that her programs will not come from her Chicago studios. Some programs will be partly original shows, and some will focus on Oprah. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests.  Some media experts are concerned that there will be saturation on the new network because of the dip in Oprah\u2019s ratings that has taken place in the past decade or so. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Hazlett quotes Oprah\u2019s statement about her \u201call-time favorite\u201d cover, the August 2004 issue, which showed her on a beach, where it was chilly enough for the photographer and crew to follow her with heaters \u2014 obviously it wasn\u2019t August for the shooting. Outstanding books also get a nod in the same anniversary issue, with 10 of them \u201cthat rocked Oprah\u2019s decade. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. Over the years, she nurtured many people who appeared on her show regularly until they had followings that enabled them to \ufb02  y on their own. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. In the line of a succession of Oprah\u2019s chefs is Art Smith, who had followed Rosie Daly. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Art Smith now owns several prestigious\u2014and expensive\u2014restau-rants, is a recognized philanthropist in his own right, and is so popular as a result of exposure on Oprah\u2019s show that newspapers carried the story and pictures of his marriage to his companion of 10 years, Jesus Salguerio, an artist and cofounder of Common Threads, a national pro-gram for children.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned.  On one of Oprah\u2019s shows featuring gays and sometimes their family members, Berkus was included. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion. Berkus has been signi\ufb01  cant in  O, The Oprah Magazine,   but now that the decision has been made to shift the taping of the daily Oprah television program to New York, the future is cloudy for Chicagoans such as Berkus, even though the announcement was made that Harpo, with its many branches, will remain in the city, and Oprah has opened another shop in Chicago, indicating she is not cutting entirely her con-nection to Chicago.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health. Whether it is his visibility in so many of Oprah\u2019s undertakings or his audacious and sometimes combative daily television show that is the source of the negative assessments, his ar-ticles \ufb01  t into an established pattern of most women\u2019s magazines.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. A num-ber of blogs and various comments also appeared, such as the recom-mendation that the marriage counselor get marriage counseling, and some papers reported Oprah\u2019s displeasure about the stories. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times. Oprah has told him she wants the show to focus on people, and that is what he is doing.

(AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. Weight seems to be the leader in the number of times a subject is introduced; Oz showed a gastric bypass \ufb01  lm on one of Oprah\u2019s programs and continues to speak of food as \u201ca socially accept-able addiction\u201d that must be dealt with psychologically. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. Oprah coauthored Greene\u2019s first book, and he later became one of the hosts on Oprah Radio XM, which formerly had been  Oprah and Friends.  His show airs on Saturdays, with other Oprah favorites hosting on other days: best friend Gayle King, mentor Maya Angelou, writer Lisa Kogan, sex therapist Dr. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site.)  As recently as 2010, when Oprah and Greene went to Orlando, pa-pers praised their efforts to improve the lives of their followers. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life. Greene\u2019s focus was on \u201cemotional eating,\u201d a subject well known to Oprah, who made it a frequent subject on her show over the years.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue.  Not all cultures obsess in the same way: white South Africa, for in-stance, a country in which racial issues remain a signi\ufb01  cant matter, seems more interested in her weight than in her race, which might be attrib-utable to Oprah\u2019s former preoccupations but also to the popularity of her magazine and programs in that country. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.) However, she will continue to be a drawing card for advertisers, as is anyone close to her.  Advertising Age  made the point that Oprah\u2019s friend Gayle King (who also is editor-at-large for  O, The Oprah Magazine ) was given Dove\u2019s \ufb01  rst Real Beauty Award.  Oprah\u2019s Harpo Productions attempts to hold tight control on all things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Oprah stopped attending tradi-tional churches and wanted to separate herself from the angry messages of preachers such as Wright. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following. Among columnists admiring of Oprah, Stanley Crouch wrote on November 12, 2007, \u201cOprah could teach the Catholic Church about taking responsibility.\u201d Oprah, said Crouch, is \u201cthe Mother Courage of talk television .\u201d  In\ufb02 uenced or at least \u201cpopularized by celebrities like Oprah,\u201d public interest in self-help spirituality has taken hold in numerous places across the country.  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  Oprah has described Tolle\u2019s book as the best book on spirituality she\u2019d ever read. Nonetheless, some members of the religious right have attacked Oprah\u2019s programs and in\ufb02  uence on her \u201cstudents,\u201d calling her \u201cthe devil.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. He disagrees with Tolle and faults Oprah for \u201cundercutting Christianity.\u201d 9   With all the negative publicity, Oprah became defensive about her choices of Tolle\u2019s books for her classes and the classes themselves, point-edly stating they were not about religion but rather to help people ex-plore their consciousness. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. Lofton, however, tempers her remarks by \ufb01  rst praising Oprah\u2019s philanthropy, but then \ufb01  nds it is linked to commercialism. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.) According to Lofton, Oprah\u2019s \u201cimperative is not to save souls .\u201d Oprah \u201cis a corporation\u201d using \u201ca religious idiom to amazing effect.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do. The Reverend Hooper builds his lectures around themes that Oprah stresses, particularly the belief that there is no one way, \u201cno one .\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d.  A month after Reverend Wright\u2019s intemperate remarks, Oprah started the Soul Series, on XM radio online. For 10 weeks, Oprah and author Eckhart Tolle taught the material from his book,  A New Earth,  the  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 17761st book featured on Oprah\u2019s Book Club as well as her choice for their summer reading. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

Calling Oprah \u201cthe Jezebel of Prophecy,\u201d a documentary \ufb01  lmmaker advertising his availability for interviews (but not interviewed by Oprah) produced a DVD,  Hebrew or the So-Called Negro,  warning of her destruc-tive effect. Another, better known, seven-minute video, \u201cThe Church of Oprah Exposed,\u201d was produced by \u201cChristian Groups.\u201d Shown on YouTube, thus guaranteeing a wide audience, it describes Oprah as de-nying major beliefs of Christianity.\u201d Coppenger moves from God\u2019s indignation to his own, faulting Oprah for having her own agenda, which includes the unacceptable \u201ccohabiting with Stedman Graham.\u201d  Some people who are interested in Oprah\u2019s love life report that she and Graham live together, and others claim that the two have separated. A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. Graham is known to be a staunch supporter of conservative Republicans, but he seemed to encourage Oprah\u2019s activities for the Democratic candidate and appeared with her, smiling and enthusiastic, at the Chicago victory rally for the new president. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Several years ago, the tabloid press was reporting on every sighting, but not so now, except for infrequent\u2014and perhaps questionable\u2014statements that Graham has other love interests, and so does Oprah, or that Graham has moved out of the apartment the two shared. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey.

Some tabloids have questioned on occasion Oprah\u2019s sexual orienta-tion and have reported that some of her biggest fans are gay men. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King. Although King shares many, many activities with Oprah and has become a prominent \ufb01  gure on her own in television and radio, as well as in Oprah\u2019s publications, both women scorn the implications of the press, and both have also stated there is no shame in anyone\u2019s being gay.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. Since their early meetings, Oprah and King have prospered, following much the same path, and the gossipy media enjoy printing information about the expensive gifts of homes Oprah has given to King\u2014one home in Connecticut for $3. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou.

Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram.  The Haggards\u2019 joint appearance on Oprah\u2019s program took place shortly before the release of a documentary about Haggard, who now earns a living selling life insurance. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. Without Oprah\u2019s golden touch, though, and no interview, the book sales were weak.  Another politician\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Edwards, also produced a per-sonal story, called  Reconciliation,  which she talked about on Oprah\u2019s show. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish. In reports of a tragic happen-ing in 2005, newspapers referred to the man responsible, James Arthur Ray, as an \u201cOprah approved self-help guru.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray. The saying that \u201call publicity is good publicity\u201d clearly did not apply to Oprah\u2019s part in the tragedy, but it quickly disappeared from the news cycle, and the reason for that remains unknown.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. When questioned, though, about Oprah\u2019s refusal to autho-rize the book, Kelley states she was not interested in going that route. But Oprah\u2019s less scandalous involvement in spiritual studies and events during the past few years has brought about more sermons, reports, praise, and condemnation than anything else to date. It re-mains to be seen what the Kelley effect does to Oprah\u2019s image, and if there is damage, how long the aftershocks linger and whether there will be any tie-in to the spiritual part of the star\u2019s life.  For several years, numerous religious \ufb01  gures have attacked every-thing Oprah has said or done about religion and spirituality. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy.\u201d They do not accuse Oprah of being anti-Christian but anti-Bible. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.\u201d The authors\u2019 intention is to show that Oprah\u2019s spirituality doesn\u2019t \ufb01  t their evangelical beliefs.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. In an article purportedly about Obama, author Robert Bowie Johnson concentrated on his beliefs about Oprah, none of them positive. But Oprah, in contrast, he claims, \u201cmocks\u201d such views in favor of \u201cself-adoration. descended from Adam and Eve,\u201d and Oprah, as evolving \u201cby chance .\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.\u201d 12   If such harsh condemnation isn\u2019t suf\ufb01  cient to turn admirers away from Oprah, it is not for lack of critics. A Web site named Jesus-is-Savior speaks of Oprah as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in the world,\u201d and the author of a self-published book,  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid  (a title that refers to the tragic deaths in 1978 of hundreds of people who had belonged to a cult) warns readers of the \u201cspell . [that] is over Oprah,\u201d suggesting they too will die because of her teachings. If the reader won-ders what it is that Oprah has unleashed upon the world, her critics \ufb01  nd endless examples. One person, Jennifer Simon, writing on a site called AlterNet, states she knows that her remarks will anger Oprah\u2019s \u201cmob of followers. The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d When  Newsweek  published a lengthy ar-ticle berating her in\ufb02  uence on the public, 14  several physicians wrote letters of support for that view, one saying she supports bad medicine in her role, creating the \u201cOprah-\ufb01  cation of medicine.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration.

Whichever the interpretation, Friedman is undoubtedly contemptuous of both Oprah and Tolle.

Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.", "Oprah_Exposed_2010": " Chapter 6  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY  Throughout the years, Oprah has hosted many shows on topics that also \ufb01  ll central roles in all magazines, not only hers: food\u2014goo d and bad; weight\u2014healthy and unhealthy; physical \ufb01  tness; spiritual happiness; and emotional strength.  Oprah\u2019s focus on healthy bodies and minds helped make her a top player in television, radio, and publishing, but it has been her unplanned as well as her planned engagements that revealed the extent of her in\ufb02  u-ence on consumers. Oprah\u2019s involvement in revealing the dangers of eating beef that could be tainted brought on a \ufb01  restorm from all segments of the industry: the economy was affected, cattlemen were enraged, lobbyists were perturbed, and, in Amarillo, Texas, the industry\u2019s lawyers brought suit against Oprah. Lines of people and 162 OPRAH WINFREYautomobiles\u2014sporting pro and con bumper stickers\u2014\ufb01  lled the streets, in addition to fans, photographers, and imported preachers.    Oprah won her case, not only initially but also on appeal, with the people closest to her giving moral support. However, the case was soon forgotten; restaurants soon took orders for beef; there have been fewer details of Oprah\u2019s eating habits; her magazine\u2019s food section is not tak-ing a position about good and bad food; and the United States appar-ently is back to eating hamburgers. Although, more recently, the matter of tainted eggs has been in the headlines, Oprah did not discuss it on her show.  Oprah\u2019s current campaign is about having people pledge to refrain from using a cell phone or texting while driving.

However, much has been also going on behind the scenes while Oprah along with her staff and colleagues deter-mined the direction OWN would take.\u201d  Anyone who has the least familiarity with Oprah\u2019s show or maga-zines knows about her lifelong battle with food and weight and her challenges over the years with one diet or another. Fifty short biographies appear in their book, one of which is Oprah\u2019s. Like others who have struggled with obesity, Oprah has sought the magic pill or diet. In 2008, she went on a vegan detox plan, and at the same time her Web site of-fered a healthy menu. Like everything else that Oprah does, it was news around the world, with enthusiastic response to the plan, at least tem-porarily.\u201d With her pleading words \u201cOprah, Oprah, Oprah,\u201d writer and co-medienne Linda Cullen professes admiration but also sees \u201ca disturbing 164 OPRAH WINFREYtrend\u201d in the many diets Oprah has followed, and she lists a few, including the names of some gurus that have become \u201cgazzillionaires\u201d because of Oprah\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps there will be future articles about Oprah\u2019s personal struggle with weight, even though she now appears to have separated herself from the subject. Known as  Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter,  it was chosen to replace the 25-year-old  Oprah Winfrey Show.  The program will be in prime time, and Oprah no longer will have a daytime offering.  When questioned by interviewers about the reasons for the dramatic changes that will be made, Oprah states: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a life.\u201d  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network that she and Discovery Net-works hold jointly, once launched in 2011, according to the  Christian Science Monitor,  \u201cis very likely the \ufb01  rst television network based around a single person.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, considering all the enterprises Oprah has been involved in over the years with the em-pire she built, as one report put it. Oprah consistently promotes self-improvement and celebrities. Oprah watchers know her empire is part magazine, part radio, part a channel on XM Sirius satellite radio, mov-ies, and the Harpo production company. Few details have been given thus far, but it has been announced that her programs will not come from her Chicago studios. Some programs will be partly original shows, and some will focus on Oprah. Even though Oprah will not be on every program, the chairman of the new network, Mary Altaffer, has assured backers and viewers that Oprah will be in charge \u201cbehind the scenes. Those  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 165announced to date run the gamut of topics, including familiar names: people who have appeared on earlier Oprah programs, such as Lady Gaga; Gayle King (who will appear regularly with her own program); Shania T wain (the Canadian country singer who will host a series called  Why Not. installments\u201d as a regular on Oprah\u2019s show); and there will also be well-known people from a wide variety of activities, including theater, jour-nalism, politics, and business. However, before those future appearances take place, Oprah is planning a program during which she will travel around the globe interviewing guests.  Some media experts are concerned that there will be saturation on the new network because of the dip in Oprah\u2019s ratings that has taken place in the past decade or so. However, the defense for that is to compare Oprah\u2019s numbers with those of other stars and to \ufb01  nd little difference. Now that Oprah\u2019s highly successful magazine has cel-ebrated its 10th anniversary while others have failed, nobody predicts its demise. One instance comes from Courtney Hazlett, who, in her MSNBC program,  The Scoop,  listed Oprah\u2019s monthly appearances on the cover of every issue in 119 different out\ufb01  ts, 74 different hairstyles, and with 2 convertible cars. Hazlett quotes Oprah\u2019s statement about her \u201call-time favorite\u201d cover, the August 2004 issue, which showed her on a beach, where it was chilly enough for the photographer and crew to follow her with heaters \u2014 obviously it wasn\u2019t August for the shooting. Outstanding books also get a nod in the same anniversary issue, with 10 of them \u201cthat rocked Oprah\u2019s decade. Oprah has frequently changed her mind about matters concerning the book club.  Oprah inevitably is a star maker. There have been dieticians and cooks\u2014among them, Rachel Ray, who has her own show, a line of kitchen 166 OPRAH WINFREYproducts, and cookbooks. Ray has had a number of appearances on Oprah\u2019s program and the Food Network. An Oprah magazine cookbook was pub-lished in 2008 that received much praise, particularly for its stunning photographs.  Others made famous through association with Oprah include Bob Greene, exercise trainer and author of books about health; Phil McGraw, the psychologist Oprah brought onto her show for numerous programs about mental health; Mehmet Oz, a practicing heart surgeon, who, like McGraw, followed the trajectory from television guest to daily host and monthly columnist as well; and Nate Berkus, a popular designer who also went from Oprah\u2019s show to one of his own, although television critics have been suggesting it may not survive in the ratings game.\u201d In calling his new venture\u2014a daytime talk program\u2014a \u201cconversation,\u201d he credits Oprah for much he has learned.  On one of Oprah\u2019s shows featuring gays and sometimes their family members, Berkus was included. Regulars de-voted to the program follow the lives of many people associated with Oprah and thus are aware of the death of Berkus\u2019s partner in the tsu-nami that struck Asia in 2004, when the two men were there on vaca- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 167tion. Berkus has been signi\ufb01  cant in  O, The Oprah Magazine,   but now that the decision has been made to shift the taping of the daily Oprah television program to New York, the future is cloudy for Chicagoans such as Berkus, even though the announcement was made that Harpo, with its many branches, will remain in the city, and Oprah has opened another shop in Chicago, indicating she is not cutting entirely her con-nection to Chicago.  All of these people have shared interests with Oprah\u2014some strictly with food and diet, some with exercise, and one with mental health. Whether it is his visibility in so many of Oprah\u2019s undertakings or his audacious and sometimes combative daily television show that is the source of the negative assessments, his ar-ticles \ufb01  t into an established pattern of most women\u2019s magazines.  Oprah continues to control the Dr. A num-ber of blogs and various comments also appeared, such as the recom-mendation that the marriage counselor get marriage counseling, and some papers reported Oprah\u2019s displeasure about the stories. Yet, despite negative comments from the press and the reputed anger of Oprah, McGraw\u2019s popular col-umn is still run in her magazine. Oprah and Dr. Oz helped 168 OPRAH WINFREYhim shave off the mustache, described as a \u201ctrademark soup strainer,\u201d he\u2019d worn for more than 40 years. Mehmet Oz has interests not only in the mental and physical elements of health, but also shares an additional passion with Oprah: spirituality.\u201d 2  Oprah\u2019s label for Oz is \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor.\u201d Before leaving for his own show, Oz appeared on Oprah\u2019s program 55 times. Oprah has told him she wants the show to focus on people, and that is what he is doing. Phil McGraw, \ufb01  nancial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in New York, May 7, 2010. (AP Photo/Evan Agostini) LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 169Because of his popularity, his is considered a strong lead-in for other shows and has been drawing large numbers of viewers from the begin-ning. Weight seems to be the leader in the number of times a subject is introduced; Oz showed a gastric bypass \ufb01  lm on one of Oprah\u2019s programs and continues to speak of food as \u201ca socially accept-able addiction\u201d that must be dealt with psychologically. It hardly needs saying that Oz is a \ufb01  rm proponent of ex-ercise and healthful foods, often doing programs about weight and fre-quently appearing with Oprah to advance health causes for children.  Of the entire group of people whom Oprah has made famous, Bob Greene may be the closest to her personally. He has mentored her for a number of years on diet and physical health but also sees the impor-tance of spirituality for Oprah\u2019s \u201cBest Life\u201d theories. Shortly after beginning work at a spa in Telluride, 170 OPRAH WINFREYfortuitously he met Oprah, who owns a house in the area. Oprah, then and for many years after, was self-conscious about her weight, and Greene, who knew nothing about her, didn\u2019t even own a televi sion set. However, she became his \ufb01  rst client at the spa, and it was not long before Oprah followed Greene\u2019s guidance in health and \ufb01  tness. Oprah coauthored Greene\u2019s first book, and he later became one of the hosts on Oprah Radio XM, which formerly had been  Oprah and Friends.  His show airs on Saturdays, with other Oprah favorites hosting on other days: best friend Gayle King, mentor Maya Angelou, writer Lisa Kogan, sex therapist Dr. On television and in her magazines, a smiling, beautiful Oprah elegantly dressed and coifed appears. Occasionally, though, she mentions her lifetime struggle with weight and recently discussed her own story on the program with author Geneen Roth, who wrote the diet book  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 171 Women, Food, and God. (It seems to have gained a seal of approval inasmuch as it was listed on Oprah\u2019s Web site.)  As recently as 2010, when Oprah and Greene went to Orlando, pa-pers praised their efforts to improve the lives of their followers. In the column \u201cOprah\u2019s Guru Brings Best Life Inspiration to Orlando,\u201d Ginger Brashinger, of  The Southwest Star,  credits Greene for providing insight about the role of food and exercise in everyone\u2019s life. Greene\u2019s focus was on \u201cemotional eating,\u201d a subject well known to Oprah, who made it a frequent subject on her show over the years.  In photos of Oprah over the 25 years in which she has been in the pub-lic eye, she is thin, thinner, fat, fatter. Although there are still a few papers that consider her struggle a topic of humor and speculate that the rest of the world does so as well, an Australian reporter \ufb01  nds some shards of sympathy, saying Oprah probably \u201chas suffered more in-dignity\u201d about the matter than anyone else in the public eye. 3   The question of racial discrimination also arises periodically, but Oprah chooses not to go down that road, and rarely does she have to confront the issue.  Not all cultures obsess in the same way: white South Africa, for in-stance, a country in which racial issues remain a signi\ufb01  cant matter, seems more interested in her weight than in her race, which might be attrib-utable to Oprah\u2019s former preoccupations but also to the popularity of her magazine and programs in that country. Oprah\u2019s magazine does 172 OPRAH WINFREYnot discuss failures, although the tabloids are ferocious in their pursuit of any failure to be found in Oprah.  As for Oprah herself, perhaps now that she has passed her mid-50s, she accepts the fact that she cannot be a size eight. She has told inter-viewers she believes in a quote from a poster she keeps in her Chicago home; it is from the good witch Glinda in  The Wizard of Oz:  \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be helped anymore.\u201d Additionally, they state, Oprah doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between \u201cgush\u201d or nonsense and useful, worthwhile infor-mation, seeing her guests as \u201cprophets,\u201d with her not knowing how to differentiate. But Oprah has usually been surefooted in her career choices, and when things do not turn out well she rarely hesi-tates to cut the string. Although China is one of the few countries that does not broadcast Oprah\u2019s shows, there is a program in China whose host has been described as \u201cChina\u2019s Oprah.  Being on Oprah\u2019s program\u2014as she was\u2014would not have in\ufb02  uenced the number of Luyu\u2019s viewers, which run into the millions, but for other people in the entertainment business, an invitation to appear on  The  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 173Oprah Winfrey Show  is a commercial goldmine for individuals, products, and, as all publishers know, books (a fact that everyone associated with writing, publishing, and selling books is deeply concerned about, now that Oprah is moving on to other things.

Oprah\u2019s Harpo Productions attempts to hold tight control on all things. In 2005 reporter Alessandra Stanley labeled Oprah \u201ca self-help evangelist,\u201d .\u201d 5  That de-scription seems to apply even more so today, as one follows what Oprah has called her \u201cbig life.\u201d Talking to another writer who queried her about future shows, Oprah revealed no speci\ufb01  cs about her involvement, but the messianic sense Stanley sees permeates all such discussions. Oprah wants to continue meaningful programming that will inspire people and lead them to think differently about their lives.\u201d 6  At the time, Morrissey believed both Obama and Oprah would be damaged by their association with Wright, but he sug-gested that Oprah would be the bigger loser because of the appeal she has had for the public. Oprah stopped attending tradi-tional churches and wanted to separate herself from the angry messages of preachers such as Wright. Soon she began to follow a new type of 174 OPRAH WINFREYChristian spirituality, leading an anonymous friend to tell a  Newsweek  reporter, \u201cThere is the church of Oprah now,\u201d and Oprah \u201chas her own following. Among columnists admiring of Oprah, Stanley Crouch wrote on November 12, 2007, \u201cOprah could teach the Catholic Church about taking responsibility.\u201d Oprah, said Crouch, is \u201cthe Mother Courage of talk television .\u201d  In\ufb02 uenced or at least \u201cpopularized by celebrities like Oprah,\u201d public interest in self-help spirituality has taken hold in numerous places across the country.  T wo newspaper writers, speaking of Oprah\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d in which she changed from being the host of a talk show to becoming \u201cInspirer in Chief,\u201d refer to two books, one by assistant professor of religious stud-ies at Yale University, Katherine Lofton, the other by author Marcia Nelson. Both have written, as have others, of Oprah\u2019s enormous in\ufb02  u- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 175ence on the book world, listing two books that have been the subject of her classes: Helen Schucman\u2019s  A Course of Miracles  and Eckhart Tolle\u2019s  A New Earth.  Oprah has described Tolle\u2019s book as the best book on spirituality she\u2019d ever read. Nonetheless, some members of the religious right have attacked Oprah\u2019s programs and in\ufb02  uence on her \u201cstudents,\u201d calling her \u201cthe devil.  7   Columnists with more moderate views note Oprah\u2019s appeal to large numbers of women, such as those who pay large amounts of money to attend one of her Live Your Best Life tours. Even women who have had great success in their own lives relate to Oprah because she searches \u201cfor the same things\u201d they do. Her presentations, he writes, renew women who attend \u201cser-vices at the Church of Oprah, which is the church of possibility. He disagrees with Tolle and faults Oprah for \u201cundercutting Christianity.\u201d 9   With all the negative publicity, Oprah became defensive about her choices of Tolle\u2019s books for her classes and the classes themselves, point-edly stating they were not about religion but rather to help people ex-plore their consciousness. On her Web site, Oprah writes that she keeps Tolle\u2019s book next to her bed. Lofton, however, tempers her remarks by \ufb01  rst praising Oprah\u2019s philanthropy, but then \ufb01  nds it is linked to commercialism. (Perhaps a similar criticism 176 OPRAH WINFREYcould be made of Tolle, whose Inspiration Cards and CDs are sold on-line.\u201d There is \u201can Oprah message,\u201d says Lofton, and, it states if you buy the recom-mended product your life will change for the better. 10   Although few reporters mention it, another important factor in Oprah\u2019s evolution came from a trip to Israel and a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, where she stated she came to her understanding of power and what she, \u201ca once colored girl,\u201d could achieve through television and all that she could do.    Pastor Hooper at the Religious Science Church of the Desert Spiri-tual Center wrote that Oprah \u201cis a mighty force . The Reverend Hooper builds his lectures around themes that Oprah stresses, particularly the belief that there is no one way, \u201cno one .\u201d  So many columnists and preachers have focused on Oprah\u2019s foray into religion and spirituality that, after a time, the intent, claims, sin-cerity, and purpose of the sermons, essays, blogs\u2014or even whether the particular writer is hawking a book\u2014becomes unclear. Or is it the advice the writers themselves volun-teer in \u201cHow to Get Your Brand on \u2018Oprah\u2019  \u201d.  A month after Reverend Wright\u2019s intemperate remarks, Oprah started the Soul Series, on XM radio online. For 10 weeks, Oprah and author Eckhart Tolle taught the material from his book,  A New Earth,  the  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 17761st book featured on Oprah\u2019s Book Club as well as her choice for their summer reading. And there have been many nonguests hostile to anything and everything Oprah stands for or advocates.  Some people\u2014professional and otherwise\u2014proclaim doom for her now or in the future; others \ufb01  nd reasons to hate her and proclaim that \u201cthe age of Oprah\u201d is about to end because white women \ufb01  nally know she is black.\u201d Furthermore, in contradiction to the fact that her magazine remains a popular seller, these same critics predict its failure because of her egoism, her choices of new age books such as  The Secret  and  The New Earth,  and for committing Talk show host Oprah Winfrey speaks about her trip to the Auschwitz concentration camp and the importance of Holocaust education to help combat genocide during an address at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, October 25, 2006.

Another, better known, seven-minute video, \u201cThe Church of Oprah Exposed,\u201d was produced by \u201cChristian Groups.\u201d Shown on YouTube, thus guaranteeing a wide audience, it describes Oprah as de-nying major beliefs of Christianity.\u201d Coppenger moves from God\u2019s indignation to his own, faulting Oprah for having her own agenda, which includes the unacceptable \u201ccohabiting with Stedman Graham.\u201d  Some people who are interested in Oprah\u2019s love life report that she and Graham live together, and others claim that the two have separated. A few years ago, there was much speculation over a rumor that Oprah had removed Graham\u2019s name from her will. Oprah has refused to say what bequests are in her will or where her fortune will go after her death.    Graham, who has been Oprah\u2019s companion for more than 20 years, appears to play a limited role nowadays in Oprah\u2019s activities, even though the two are shown together occasionally in photographs, and more frequently during the period of the presidential nominations and election. News reports tell that Oprah provides funds for charitable causes in Graham\u2019s hometown. However, the public are not privy to many  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 179facts of Oprah\u2019s personal life, and she requires staff to maintain her privacy. Several years ago, the tabloid press was reporting on every sighting, but not so now, except for infrequent\u2014and perhaps questionable\u2014statements that Graham has other love interests, and so does Oprah, or that Graham has moved out of the apartment the two shared. Over the years, various books, magazines, and tabloids have attempted, sometimes successfully, to unearth information about the romances in Oprah\u2019s younger days. However, Oprah will not comment on those stories and, with only a few exceptions, rarely will any past lover do so either. Oprah had no comment about his remarks. However, she often repeats the Stedman Graham and Oprah Winfrey walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors, in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2010. Jones, Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey.

Some tabloids have questioned on occasion Oprah\u2019s sexual orienta-tion and have reported that some of her biggest fans are gay men. The same press organizations also speculate frequently on Oprah\u2019s relation-ship to Gayle King. Although King shares many, many activities with Oprah and has become a prominent \ufb01  gure on her own in television and radio, as well as in Oprah\u2019s publications, both women scorn the implications of the press, and both have also stated there is no shame in anyone\u2019s being gay.\u201d  Unquestionably, King, like others among Oprah\u2019s friends, has ben-e\ufb01  ted from the connection to one of the most famous and richest women in the world; their friendship goes back to their days as rela-tive unknowns in Baltimore. Oprah, their godmother, spoke at both their college graduations. Since their early meetings, Oprah and King have prospered, following much the same path, and the gossipy media enjoy printing information about the expensive gifts of homes Oprah has given to King\u2014one home in Connecticut for $3. The same report in the  New York Daily News  states that Oprah has given King a large amount of money as well. But, after all, Oprah is known to be one of the most generous people on the globe.  Perhaps the only woman who is as close to Oprah as Gayle King is Maya Angelou, the person Oprah speaks of with love and admiration and the deep connection she feels to her \u201cmentor-mother-sister-friend.\u201d With the rocky, unhappy, fractured relationship Oprah has with her birth mother, the reasons for the love and trust she holds for Angelou seem obvious.  Having declared again and again that she wants to give back to a world that has given her so much, Oprah\u2019s charitable work is unpar- LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 181alleled. Clearly, Oprah loves to have fun, give parties, and see friends, and over the years she has held a number of spectacular events for those she holds dear, King and Angelou. The \u201conce colored girl,\u201d now the \u201cqueen of media,\u201d or \u201cthe Mama\u201d as she calls herself to her African students, is frequently shown in exquisite gowns hosting her own affair or a party for charity, perhaps to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as she did in the spring of 2010.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)182 OPRAH WINFREY Jennie Rothenberg Gritz, writing in  The Atlantic,  thinks men \ufb01  nd Oprah \u201ctroublesome,\u201d because she has the \u201ccapacity to take over the world,\u201d and they object to the ways that women follow Oprah, who has \u201cinvaded their homes\u2014from kitchen to bedroom.\u201d Apparently, or not so apparently, she tells readers, men object to the changes Oprah has wrought in marital relationships. Rather, the seamier topics bring in the audience for Oprah\u2019s pro-gram.  The Haggards\u2019 joint appearance on Oprah\u2019s program took place shortly before the release of a documentary about Haggard, who now earns a living selling life insurance. Laura Bush\u2019s  Spoken from the Heart  came out in 2010, shortly before Oprah interviewed her and her two daughters at the Bush ranch.  Another political wife, Jenny Sanford, former wife of the governor of South Carolina, wrote about her marital situation in  Staying True,  but  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 183she did not appear on Oprah\u2019s show, although the press was all over the story, even reminding a fascinated public that she was an heiress and former banker, and showing photos of the former Mrs. Without Oprah\u2019s golden touch, though, and no interview, the book sales were weak.  Another politician\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Edwards, also produced a per-sonal story, called  Reconciliation,  which she talked about on Oprah\u2019s show. When Oprah announced that \u201cthe other woman,\u201d Rielle Hunter, would be on her show, bloggers, in large numbers, wrote angry letters, several of them criticizing Oprah. Edwards and annoyance with Oprah. As anticipated, huge num-bers of bloggers as well as news and television reports followed the ap-pearance of Hunter on Oprah\u2019s April 30, 2010, program. Half a page of print and pictures in the  Washington Post  portray the two\u2014Oprah and Hunter\u2014seated across from each other in Hunter\u2019s living room in Charlotte, North Carolina, as they discuss what the  Post \u2019s televi-sion critic, Lisa de Moraes, mockingly calls \u201cJohnny Edwards\u2019s life of integrity.\u201d The details of the romance provided by Hunter sound much 184 OPRAH WINFREYlike a combination of a fairy tale and the old  True Confessions  magazine. De Moraes captures the essence of both, as she quotes some of Oprah\u2019s remarks and adds some equally droll lines of her own. Oprah: \u201cWhy did you, Miss Spirituality in Alignment With the Truth .\u201d  Even the sophisticated and cynical television newspeople could not refrain from showing clips of Oprah\u2019s interview. The staff writers of  The Daily Buzz   described Hunter\u2019s responses to Oprah as \u201cwacky, new-age like refer-ences,\u201d while the  New York Post  commented how \u201cincredulous\u201d Oprah often seemed.  Arts and Entertainment  was kinder in describing the event as one of Oprah\u2019s more \u201cprovocative\u201d interviews. Online Time  Enter-tainment  compliments Oprah as \u201cthe perfect interrogator,\u201d noting that she is the television person with the most years of experience in \u2018in-terviewing crazies.\u201d With the title of the story \u201cOprah Grills Deluded Edwards Mistress Rielle,\u201d the writer captures what Oprah intended for all watchers to see: \u201cskepticism in [her] eyes, as Hunter provided her and her viewers \u201cthe full tour of her scenic hometown, Delusionville. The story did not disappear for weeks after Hunter\u2019s interview with Oprah; still another one appeared in a newspaper, an interview with Hunter\u2019s sister, Roxanne Marshall, who spoke for Hunter\u2019s family, stating they were very upset by her behavior and her indifference to the effect on Elizabeth Edwards as well as the Edwards\u2019s children.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 185 Blogs about Oprah, her show, her activities, and certain lurid stories surrounding her or guests on her programs cover multiple pages on the Internet, whereas other stories languish. In reports of a tragic happen-ing in 2005, newspapers referred to the man responsible, James Arthur Ray, as an \u201cOprah approved self-help guru.  A number of bloggers, while not defending Ray, were very critical of Oprah\u2019s role in the event and of her relationship to Ray. The saying that \u201call publicity is good publicity\u201d clearly did not apply to Oprah\u2019s part in the tragedy, but it quickly disappeared from the news cycle, and the reason for that remains unknown.  Oprah always has professionals\u2014lawyers and staff\u2014to handle any-thing that threatens her image, except now Kitty Kelley\u2019s unauthorized biography\u2014over which Oprah has had limited control. Oprah, even though she dislikes publicity apart from her professional life, is often involved in suing or being sued. However, Kelley claims she has been kept from interviews on television programs because of Oprah\u2019s power-ful reach. When questioned, though, about Oprah\u2019s refusal to autho-rize the book, Kelley states she was not interested in going that route. But Oprah\u2019s less scandalous involvement in spiritual studies and events during the past few years has brought about more sermons, reports, praise, and condemnation than anything else to date. It re-mains to be seen what the Kelley effect does to Oprah\u2019s image, and if there is damage, how long the aftershocks linger and whether there will be any tie-in to the spiritual part of the star\u2019s life.  For several years, numerous religious \ufb01  gures have attacked every-thing Oprah has said or done about religion and spirituality. At McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Virginia, two Christian evangelicals, Josh McDowell and Dave Sterrett, warned a crowd of 1,500 about Oprah\u2019s 186 OPRAH WINFREYspiritual teachings. The warning is that Oprah has created \u201ca hodge-podge of personalized faith, which is dangerous\u201d\u2014views they expressed in the book they wrote together,  \u201cO\u201d God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah\u2019s Spirituality. Although, they claim, Oprah uses bibli-cal and Christian terms and references, they are used falsely when she speaks of Jesus and humans as part of \u201cUltimate Being\u201d and \u201cUniversal Energy.\u201d They do not accuse Oprah of being anti-Christian but anti-Bible. McDowell states that Oprah \ufb01  nds meaning through the claims of people she agrees with rather than by serving \u201ca jealous God\u201d and that she ap-parently doesn\u2019t really question their statements. Writer Michelle Bearden states in her review of McDowell and Sterrett\u2019s book that it won\u2019t \u201cmake it as selection for Oprah\u2019s book club.\u201d The authors\u2019 intention is to show that Oprah\u2019s spirituality doesn\u2019t \ufb01  t their evangelical beliefs.  Everyone knows that appearing on Oprah\u2019s show carries cachet. Ministers look to achieve publicity, and perhaps followers, from being on the prized Oprah show. Michael Beckwith, founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center in Cul-ver City, California, and author of the book  Spiritual Liberation  (2009), appeared on the Oprah program in 2009. However, his claim in 2009 to a reporter at the  Atlanta Journal Constitution  that he is \u201cWinfrey\u2019s spiritual advisor\u201d has not been veri\ufb01  ed by Oprah, nor was it repeated in his Wikipedia biography. Beckwith is not the only person claiming to be Oprah\u2019s spiritual advisor; the list grows and grows.  Politicians, governors present and former, wanting the publicity or not, become the subject of contrast to Oprah. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and prominent Republican candidate for vice president during the 2008 election, was chosen during that time as an example to hold up against Oprah because the star was campaigning for then Senator  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 187Obama. In an article purportedly about Obama, author Robert Bowie Johnson concentrated on his beliefs about Oprah, none of them positive. But Oprah, in contrast, he claims, \u201cmocks\u201d such views in favor of \u201cself-adoration. descended from Adam and Eve,\u201d and Oprah, as evolving \u201cby chance .\u201d To solidify his points, he then links Oprah to \u201cher mentor, Tolle,\u201d because they view themselves \u201cas God.\u201d 12   If such harsh condemnation isn\u2019t suf\ufb01  cient to turn admirers away from Oprah, it is not for lack of critics. A Web site named Jesus-is-Savior speaks of Oprah as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in the world,\u201d and the author of a self-published book,  Don\u2019t Drink the Kool-Aid  (a title that refers to the tragic deaths in 1978 of hundreds of people who had belonged to a cult) warns readers of the \u201cspell . [that] is over Oprah,\u201d suggesting they too will die because of her teachings. If the reader won-ders what it is that Oprah has unleashed upon the world, her critics \ufb01  nd endless examples. One person, Jennifer Simon, writing on a site called AlterNet, states she knows that her remarks will anger Oprah\u2019s \u201cmob of followers. The writer answers: Oprah has an \u201cA-list of freaks\u201d; she hasn\u2019t taught women to be happy at any weight; she pushes the notion that spending brings hap-piness; she has created \u201cthe monster, Dr. 13   Oprah is attacked frequently for her association with Dr.  Various doctors object not only to the advice put forth by both McGraw and Oprah, but some go further, calling many of her claims 188 OPRAH WINFREYabout medicine \u201cludicrous.\u201d When  Newsweek  published a lengthy ar-ticle berating her in\ufb02  uence on the public, 14  several physicians wrote letters of support for that view, one saying she supports bad medicine in her role, creating the \u201cOprah-\ufb01  cation of medicine.\u201d 15   Of course, bloggers again jumped into that fray, some in support of the magazine and some with anti-Oprah views, even calling her a \u201cuse-ful idiot\u201d; but others staunchly defended her as \u201can amazing woman\u201d as opposed to sexists and racists of \u201cthe privileged class.\u201d While lauding Oprah, Mark Goulston exco-riates Dr. Phil as an \u201copportunist\u201d who has taken advantage of Oprah.  It was Oprah\u2019s strong endorsement of Helen Schucman\u2019s book,  A Course of Miracles,  as well as other books and philosophy, which turned a small \ufb01  re into a con\ufb02  agration.

Whichever the interpretation, Friedman is undoubtedly contemptuous of both Oprah and Tolle.  LIVING LIFE THE OPRAH WAY 189 Although it was Oprah who made Tolle famous, one might question the idea that she alone is entirely responsible for his overwhelming success. 16   At times it seems that Oprah does nothing but work, travel for busi-ness, give talks, appear on shows other than her own, and on and on. Even when she talks of being overworked or having no life of her own, her friend Gayle King, who may know her better than anyone else does, tells interviewers that not only does Oprah thrive on doing good, but she also loves to work.

One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom.\u201d  Despite the dif\ufb01  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah\u2019s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life.)  In middle age, a grateful, happy Oprah is suggesting just that. Even though she has been harshly at-tacked in pulpits, books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs by numerous  OPRAH\u2019S YELLOW BRICK ROAD 193members of traditional religions, she has always moved on. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television \u201cas one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings. But as a lover of gospel music, Oprah has a favorite song that seems to sum up her life-time view: \u201cStand. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: \u201cWhen you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters. It is little wonder that entertainer Zach Braff was led to say in 2007, \u201cIn television, there\u2019s  Oprah,  and then there\u2019s everyone else.

One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom.\u201d  Despite the dif\ufb01  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah\u2019s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life.)  In middle age, a grateful, happy Oprah is suggesting just that. Even though she has been harshly at-tacked in pulpits, books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs by numerous  OPRAH\u2019S YELLOW BRICK ROAD 193members of traditional religions, she has always moved on. Nevertheless, like Dorothy of  The Wizard of Oz,  who danced along the yellow brick road in her red jeweled shoes, Oprah keeps moving on and has left the old shoes behind. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television \u201cas one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings. But as a lover of gospel music, Oprah has a favorite song that seems to sum up her life-time view: \u201cStand. And much like the Ancient Mariner\u2014who tells his tale when it is necessary, passing \u201cfrom land to land\u201d with a \u201cstrange power of speech,\u201d knowing that when he encounters certain people he must teach them with his tale \u2014 Oprah often seems to sense such needs. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: \u201cWhen you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters. It is little wonder that entertainer Zach Braff was led to say in 2007, \u201cIn television, there\u2019s  Oprah,  and then there\u2019s everyone else.

One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television \u201cas one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters.

One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. Schools were segregated, and most women had returned to their homes to raise families after World 192 OPRAH WINFREYWar II, while men went back to their jobs, went to universities, and re-claimed their roles as heads of family. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom.\u201d  Despite the dif\ufb01  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah\u2019s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: \u201cWhen you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. In one forum or another\u2014in speeches, writings, and programs\u2014Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters.
