{"Einstein_1905": " I was accompanying Einstein on a walk from\nThe Institute for Advanced Study to his home, when he suddenly stopped, turned\nto me, and asked me if I really believed that the moon exists only if I look at it. The twentieth century physicist does not, of\ncourse, claim to have the definitive answer to this question. That, in very broad terms, is the lesson of the theory of\nrelativity, which Einstein created, and of quantum mechanics, which he eventually\naccepted as (in his words) the most successful theory of our period but which, he\nbelieved, was none the less only provisional in character.\nTo make that question more precise, it is necessary to understand Einstein's\ncredo in regard not just to quantum physics but to all of physics. My conversations with Einstein taught me ,'ittle about that. Only many\nyears after Einstein's death did I see the beginnings of an answer when I realized\n5\n6 INTRODUCTORY\nthat, nearly a decade before the discovery of modern quantum mechanics, he had\nbeen the first to understand that the nineteenth century ideal of causality was\nabout to become a grave issue in quantum physics. When Einstein was fifty years old, he wrote in the introduction to\nthe biography by his son-in-law Rudolph Kayser, 'What has perhaps been over-\nlooked is the irrational, the inconsistent, the droll, even the insane, which nature,\ninexhaustibly operative, implants in an individual, seemingly for her own amuse-\nment.\nI should briefly explain how it happened that I went on that walk with Einstein\nand why we came to talk about the moon. Einstein appeared forever as his leading spiritual partner\u2014even after the\nlatter's death he would argue with him as if Einstein were still alive' [PI]. I missed my first\nopportunity to catch a glimpse of Einstein as he walked next to President Truman\nin the academic parade. And, as had been the case with my first discussions with\nBohr, I did not understand what Einstein was talking about.\nNot long thereafter, I encountered Einstein in front of the Institute and told\nhim that I had not followed his argument with Bohr and asked if I could come to\nhis office some time for further enlightenment.\nEinstein's company was comfortable and comforting to those who knew him. I recall the case of Professor X, who\nhad been quoted by the newspapers as having found solutions to Einstein's gen-\neralized equations of gravitation. Einstein said to me, 'Der Mann ist ein Narr,'\nthe man is a fool, and added that, in his opinion, X could calculate but could not\nthink. X had visited Einstein to discuss this work, and Einstein, always courteous,\nhad said to him that his, X's, results would be important if true. Einstein was\nchagrined to have been quoted in the papers without this last provision. According\nto Einstein, the whole thing started because X, in his enthusiasm, had repeated\nEinstein's opinion to some colleagues who saw the value of it as publicity for their\nuniversity. Einstein walked in just after\nI had begun.\n8 INTRODUCTORY\nin Princeton on March 19,1949, on the occasion of Einstein's seventieth birthday.\nMost of us were in our seats when Einstein entered the hall. Pauli, not known for an excess of awe, was just slightly different in Einstein's\ncompany.\nWhenever I met Einstein, our conversations might range far and wide but\ninvariably the discussion would turn to physics. When relativity was the issue, he would often talk of his efforts to\nunify gravitation and electromagnetism and of his hopes for the next steps. Einstein never\nceased to ponder the meaning of the quantum theory.\nThe most interesting thing I learned from these conversations was how Einstein\nthought and, to some extent, who he was. It had\nnot taken long before I grasped the essence of the Einstein-Bohr dialogue: com-\nplementarity versus objective reality. I learned only much later that Einstein had once said to\nhis friend Otto Stern, 'I have thought a hundred times as much about the quantum\nproblems as I have about general relativity theory' [Jl]. One day I told Einstein a Jewish joke. In all the years I knew\nEinstein, I never read any of his papers, on the simple grounds that I already\nknew what to a physicist was memorable in them and did not need to know what\nhad been superseded. My discussions with\nEinstein never were historical interviews.\nI did read Einstein's papers as the years went by, and my interest in him as an\nhistorical figure grew.\nThe study of his papers, discussions with others who knew him, access to the\nEinstein Archives, personal reminiscences\u2014these are the ingredients which led to\nthis book. The early period, from Einstein's birth in 1879 to the beginning of his\nacademic career as Privatdozent in Bern in February 1908, is discussed in (3),\nwhich contains a sketch of his childhood, his school years (contrary to popular\nbelief he earned high marks in elementary as well as high school), his brief reli-\ngious phase, his student days, his initial difficulties in finding a job, and most of\nthe period he spent at the patent office in Bern, a period that witnesses the death\nof his father, his marriage to Mileva Marie, and the birth of his first son. The story of the Berlin days is continued\nin (16) which ends with Einstein's permanent departure from Europe. Following this, (16b) and (16c) are devoted\nto the abrupt emergence in 1919 of Einstein (whose genius had already been fully\nrecognized for some time by his scientific peers) as a charismatic world figure and\nto my views on the causes of this striking phenomenon. The book ends with a detailed\nEinstein chronology (32).\nBefore starting on a similar tour of the scientific part, I interject a few remarks\non Einstein and politics and on Einstein as a philosopher and humanist.\nWhenever I think of Einstein and politics, I recall my encounter with him in\nthe late evening of Sunday, April 11, 1954.) The operator asked for Dr Einstein. He was eager for a\nstatement by Einstein as soon as possible. I realized that pandemonium on Mercer\nStreet the next morning might be avoided by a brief statement that evening and\nso said that I would talk it over with Einstein and would call back in any event.\nI drove to Mercer Street and rang the bell; Helen Dukas, Einstein's secretary, let\nme in. After I told him the reason for\nmy call, Einstein burst out laughing.\nWe drew it up, and Einstein read it over the phone to the AP director in Wash-\nington.\nWas Einstein's initial response correct. Nothing was more alien\nto Einstein than to settle any issue by compromise, in his life or in his science.* In my view, Einstein was not only not naive\nbut highly aware of the nature of man's sorrows and his follies. After\nthe death of Leo Arons, a physicist Einstein admired for his political courage but\nwhom he did not know personally, he wrote an obituary in Sozialistische Mon-\natshefte [E2]. In 1923 Einstein became\na cofounder of the Association of Friends of the New Russia.\nPacifism and supranationalism were Einstein's two principal political ideals. Much documentation related to Einstein's inter-\nests in and involvements with political matters is found in the book Einstein on\nPeace [Nl]).\nEinstein was a lover of wisdom. The answer to that\n\"The account of Einstein's consultancy given in [Gl] is inaccurate.\n**Einstein's cousin Lina Einstein died in Auschwitz. It is as\ncertain that Einstein's interest in philosophy was genuine as it is that he did not\nconsider himself a philosopher. In 1943 Einstein, Godel, Bertrand Rus-\nsell, and Pauli gathered at Einstein's home to discuss philosophy of science about\nhalf a dozen times [Rl]. Further remarks by Einstein on philosophical issues\nwill be deferred until (16e), except for his comments on Newton.\nThe men whom Einstein at one time or another acknowledged as his precursors\nwere Newton, Maxwell, Mach, Planck, and Lorentz. Of his veneration for Planck, I shall write in (18a); of the influ-\nence of Mach* in (15e); and of his views of Maxwell in (16e).\nEinstein's deep emotional urge not to let anything interfere with his thinking\ndates back to his childhood and lends an unusual quality of detachment to his\npersonal life. On the other hand, Einstein considered\nMach to be 'un deplorable philosophe' [E7], if only because to Mach the reality of atoms remained\nforever anathema.\nIt seems to me that, when in midlife Einstein wrote of 'The wonderful events\nwhich the great Newton experienced in his young days.\n'Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of Science. [Ell]\nHowever, in one respect Einstein forever continued to side with Newton and\nto quote his authority. On the occasion of the\nbicentenary of Newton's death, Einstein wrote to the secretary of the Royal Soci-\nety, 'All who share humbly in pondering over the secrets of physical events are\nwith you in spirit, and join in the admiration and love that bind us to Newton',\nthen went on to comment on the evolution of physics since Newton's day and\nconcluded as follows:\nIt is only in the quantum theory that Newton's differential method becomes\ninadequate, and indeed strict causality fails us. Einstein's hope for a return to that old causality is an impossible dream. Of\ncourse, this opinion, held by modern physicists, has not prevented them from rec-\nognizing Einstein as by far the most important scientific figure of this century.\nl6 INTRODUCTORY\nEinstein deserves to be given the same compliment he gave Newton: he, too,\nwas an artist in exposition. The student of Einstein should read him in Ger-\nman.\n**I have no clear picture of Einstein's habits and preferences in regard to literature.\nPURPOSE AND PLAN l~]\nAs a conclusion to this introductory sketch of Einstein the man, I should like to\nelaborate the statement made in the Preface that Einstein was the freest man I\nhave known.\nI now turn to a tour of Einstein's science.\nEinstein never cared much for teaching courses. In that year Einstein produced six papers:\n1. The first paper on special relativity, received* June 30. The second paper on special relativity, containing the E = me2 relation,\nreceived* September 27. None of\nthese first five papers left much of a mark on physics, but I believe they were very\nimportant warming-up exercises in Einstein's own development. Whether these events helped to promote the emergence\nof Einstein's genius I cannot tell, though I believe that the arrival of the son may\nhave been a profound experience.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book. Three of these methods are found in Einstein's work of 1905. Einstein's later work (1911) on the\nblueness of the sky and on critical opalescence yielded still other counting methods\n(5e). A\nsurvey of the contributions to this problem by Einstein's predecessors as well as\nby Einstein himself is presented in (4). In those early days, Einstein was not the\nonly one to underestimate the mathematical care that this very complex problem\nrightfully deserves.\nTo Einstein, the second problem was of deeper interest than the first.\nNevertheless, Einstein's preoccupation with the fundamental questions of sta-\ntistical mechanics was extremely vital since it led to his most important contri-\nbutions to the quantum theory. It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum.\nEinstein's active involvement with statistical physics began in 1902 and lasted\nuntil 1925, when he made his last major contribution to physics: his treatment of\nthe quantum statistics of molecules (23).\nLong periods of gestation are a marked characteristic in Einstein's scientific\ndevelopment. Questions that lie at the root of the special theory of relativity\ndawned on him as early as 1895 (6d); the theory saw the light in June 1905.\nI focus next on special relativity. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. It begins with\nbrief remarks on the nineteenth century concept of the aether (6a), that quaint,\nhypothetical medium which was introduced for the purpose of explaining the\nPURPOSE AND PLAN 21\ntransmission of light waves and which was abolished by Einstein. The question\nhas often been asked whether or not Einstein disposed of the aether because he\nwas familiar with the Michelson-Morley experiment, which, with great accuracy,\nhad demonstrated the absence of an anticipated drift of the aether as the earth\nmoved through it without obstruction (6a). The answer is that Einstein undoubt-\nedly knew of the Michelson-Morley result (6d) but that probably it played only\nan indirect role in the evolution of his thinking (7a). From 1907 on, Einstein often\nemphasized the fundamental importance of the work by Michelson and Morley,\nbut continued to be remarkably reticent about any direct influence of that exper-\niment on his own development.\nTwo major figures, Lorentz and Poincare, take their place next to Einstein in\nthe history of special relativity. Lorentz, founder of the theory of electrons,\ncodiscoverer of the Lorentz contraction (as Poincare named it), interpreter of the\nZeeman effect, acknowledged by Einstein as his precursor, wrote down the Lor-\nentz transformations (so named by Poincare) in 1904. In 1905, Einstein, at that\ntime aware only of Lorentz's writings up to 1895, rediscovered these transfor-\nmations. In 1898, Poincare, one of the greatest mathematicians of his day and a\nconsummate mathematical physicist, had written that we have no direct intuition\nof the simultaneity of events occurring in two different places, a remark almost\ncertainly known to Einstein before 1905 (6b). In 1905 Einstein and Poincare\nstated independently and almost simultaneously (within a matter of weeks) the\ngroup properties of the Lorentz transformations and the addition theorem of veloc-\nities. Only Einstein saw the cru-\ncial new point: the dynamic aether must be abandoned in favor of a new kine-\nmatics based on two new postulates (7).\nSpecial relativity brought clarity to old physics and created new physics, in par-\nticular Einstein's derivation (also in 1905) of the relation E = me2 (7b). After 1905 Ein-\nstein paid only occasional attention to other implications (7d), mainly because\nfrom 1907 he was after bigger game: general relativity.\nThe history of the discovery of general relativity is more complicated. In the quantum theory, Planck\nstarted before Einstein. In special relativity, Lorentz inspired him. Einstein was canonized in 1919 when this second prediction also\nproved to be correct (16b).\nAfter 1915 Einstein continued to examine problems in general relativity. He was also the founder\nof general relativistic cosmology, the modern theory of the universe at large (15e).\nHubble's discovery that the universe is expanding was made in Einstein's lifetime.\nOn his road to general relativity, Einstein had found the nineteenth century\ngeometry of Riemann waiting for him. Thus\nEinstein's work was the direct cause of the development of a new branch of math-\nematics, the theory of connections (17c).\nIn concluding this tour, I return to Einstein's contributions to the quantum\ntheory. I must add that, late in 1906, Einstein became the founder of the quantum\ntheory of the solid state by giving the essentially correct explanation of the anom-\nalous behavior of hard solids, such as diamond, for example, at low temperatures\n(20). Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. That, I believe, was Einstein's one revolutionary contribution to physics\n(2). In (25) I describe in detail Einstein's response to this new development.\nHowever, Einstein never had a good word for the relativity version of quantum\nmechanics known as quantum field theory. In the absence of this synthesis, any assessment of Einstein's vision must be\npart of open history. General comments on relativity and quantum theory come\nnext, followed by a sketch of Einstein's early years. Einstein, Die Vossische Zeitung, May 23, 1916. \u2014\u2014 in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (P. Margot Einstein, letter to M. Norden, Einstein on Peace, Schocken, New York, 1968. Oppenheimer in Einstein, a Centennial Volume (A.2\nRelativity Theory\nand Quantum Theory\nEinstein's life ended . The birth of quan-\ntum theory (1900) and relativity theory (1905) marked the beginning of an era in\nwhich the very foundations of physical theory were found to be in need of revision.\nTwo men led the way toward the new theoretical concepts: Max Karl Ernst Lud-\nwig Planck, professor at the University of Berlin, possessed\u2014perhaps obsessed\u2014\nby the search for the universal function of frequency and temperature, known to\nexist since 1859, when Gustav Robert Kirchhoff formulated his fundamental law\nof blackbody radiation (19a)*; and Albert Einstein, technical expert at the Swiss\npatent office in Bern, working in an isolation which deserves to be called splendid\n(3). In the course of addressing Planck on\nthe occasion of Planck's sixtieth birthday, Einstein said:\nThe longing to behold .\n**An expression of Leibniz's which Einstein considered particularly apt.\nThis overriding urge for harmony directed Einstein's scientific life as much as it\ndid Planck's.\nThe main purpose of this chapter is to make some introductory comments on\nEinstein's attitude to the quantum and relativity theories.' Then Einstein went on to say,\n'The theory of relativity is a theory of principle.)\nThus, toward the end of the decade 1895-1905 a new theory of principle had\nemerged: special relativity.\nThe discovery of the quantum theory in 1900 (19a) and of special relativity in\n1905 (7) have in common that neither was celebrated by press releases, dancing\nin the streets, or immediate proclamations of the dawn of a new era. Nevertheless, senior\nmen like Planck, as well as a new generation of theorists, readily recognized spe-\ncial relativity to be fully specified by the two principles stated by Einstein in his\n1905 paper (7a). Nor should one underestimate the tremendous, highly\nconcrete, and lasting contributions of the conquistadores, Einstein among them,\nwho created the old quantum theory.)\nNo one appreciated the marked differences between the evolution of relativity\nand quantum theory earlier and better than Einstein, the only man who had been\ninstrumental in creating both.\nEarly in 1905 he wrote a letter to a friend in which he announced his forth-\ncoming papers on the quantum theory and on special relativity.\nIn a report of a lecture on relativity that Einstein gave in London on June 13,\n1921, we read, 'He [Einstein] deprecated the idea that the new principle was\nrevolutionary.\nIn the fall of 1919, in the course of a discussion with a student, Einstein handed\nher a cable which had informed him that the bending of light by the sun was in\nagreement with his general relativistic prediction. Einstein replied, 'Da konnt'\nmir halt der liebe Gott leid tun. (This statement is not at\nvariance with the fact that Einstein was actually quite excited when he first heard\nthe news of the bending of light (16b).\nRegarding Einstein's judgment of his own role in quantum physics, there is\nfirst of all his description of his 1905 paper 'On a heuristic point of view concern-\ning the generation and transformation of light' as very revolutionary (19c).\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 31\nthe Planck medal from Planck's own hands. By then the revolutionary period of\nthe old quantum theory\u2014which coincided exactly with the years of Einstein's\nhighest creativity.\nEinstein dissented. That is the briefest characterization of Einstein's scientific philosophy. What\ndrove Einstein to this search which he himself called 'quite bizarre as seen from\nthe outside' [E5] . As I shall discuss in (27), the answer has to do with a grand\ndesign which Einstein conceived early, before the discovery of quantum mechanics,\nfor a synthetic physical theory. It was to be a theory of particles and fields in\nwhich general relativity and quantum theory would be synthesized.\nThe phenomena to be explained by a theory of principle have become enor-\nmously richer since the days when Einstein made the first beginnings with his\nprogram.\n'If we could have presented Einstein with a synthesis of his general relativity\nand the quantum theory, then the discussion with him would have been consid-\nerably easier' [PI]. (These phenomena were first\nobserved after Einstein's death.\nIn summary, physicists today are hard at work to meet Einstein's demands for\nsynthesis, using methods of which he probably would be critical. Despite much progress, Einstein's earlier\ncomplaint remains valid to this day: 'The theories which have gradually been\nassociated with what has been observed have led to an unbearable accumulation\nof independent assumptions' [E8]. 74. Bergson, Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de la Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein, Ansprachen in der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft, p. Interscience, New York, 1964. 74. Einstein's Contributions at a Glance\nEinstein's activities related to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and kinetic\ntheory begin with his very first paper, completed at the end of 1900, and span a\nquarter of a century, during which time he wrote close to forty articles bearing in\nvarying degree on these subjects.\nIn an autobiographical sketch published in 1949, Einstein's comments on his\ncontributions to statistical physics are relatively brief. The influential review on the conceptual basis of statistical mechanics\ncompleted in that same year by his friends and admirers Paul Ehrenfest and\nTatiana Ehrenfest-Affanasjewa refers to these Einstein articles only in passing,\nin an appendix [E3]. It is true that Einstein's papers of 1902-4 did not add much\nthat was new to the statistical foundations of the second law of thermodynamics.\nIt is also true that, as Einstein himself pointed out [E4], these papers are no pre-\nrequisite for the understanding of his work of 1905 on the reality of molecules.\nIt would be entirely beside the mark, however, to consider Einstein's main con-\n*In 1901, he had sent the first of these papers to Zurich in the hope that it might be accepted as his\ndoctoral thesis; see Chapter 3. However, it is hard to imagine the embattled Boltzmann evincing\nthe serious yet playful spirit with which Einstein handled the problem of molec-\nular reality.\nEven more profoundly novel are Einstein's applications of statistical ideas to\nquantum physics. After 1905, Einstein did occasionally return\nto classical statistical physics, but in those later years all his main work on statis-\ntical problems was in the domain of the quantum theory.\nSince Einstein's papers on statistical physics cover so much ground, it may be\nhelpful to preface a more detailed discussion of their main points with a brief\nchronology.\nEinstein's hypothesis is, of course, incorrect. The paper concludes with an apology by Einstein for not being in a\nposition to contribute personally to the experimental clarification of his theoretical\nideas.\nThat Einstein was quite taken with the concept of a universal molecular force\nis seen from a letter to Grossmann in 1901.'\nIn December 1907, Einstein wrote to Stark: 'I am sending you . And so we meet for the\nfirst time a trait typical of Einstein throughout his life. Einstein derived the relation [E5]\nThis result is discussed by Schottky [S3].\n58 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\n1902-4. Einstein published a brief com-\nment on these papers in 1911 [E2].\nMarch 1905.\nApril 1905.\n1905-8.\n1906. In 1911 Einstein summarized the status of the specific heat problem\nbefore the first Solvay conference [E42].\nThis concludes the introductory summary of Einstein's work on statistical phys-\nics and related subjects. Sections 4c and 4d deal with the 1902-4 papers and\nwith Einstein's subsequent involvement with Boltzmann's principle. Chapter 5,\nwhich opens with introductory remarks on the highly complex subject of molec-\nular reality in the nineteenth century, is devoted mainly to Einstein's doctoral\nthesis, Brownian motion, and critical opalescence.\nAt the beginning of this section, I remarked that Einstein devoted some but not\nmuch attention to his contributions to statistical physics when, at age seventy, he\nlooked back on his work. Gibbs will not enter into this review because he did not\ninfluence Einstein and also because, as Lorentz noted in Einstein's presence, the\nEinstein and Gibbs approaches are different [L2]. Einstein did not disagree. One of the aims of this chapter is to explain what Einstein had in\nmind with his phenomenological approach.\nIn concluding this introduction, I note that the period of Einstein's activities\n60 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nconcerning the foundations of statistical mechanics preceded the appearance of the\nfirst papers in which it was noted that all was not well with Boltzmann's ergodic\nhypothesis. Lorentz referred to k as Planck's constant as late as 1911 [L3].\nI alluded earlier to Einstein's critical attitude toward some of Boltzmann's ideas. In fact, that very\ndefinition was Einstein's own favorite one. (Lorentz\nlater called this definition the time ensemble of Einstein [L3], perhaps not the\nmost felicitous of names.) Rather, Einstein had reservations about the second def-\ninition of probability, which Boltzmann gave in the paper of 1877 [B6].3)\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 65\nEinstein's precursors have now been sufficiently introduced.3 in its\nbroader sense was Einstein. It was also Einstein who, in 1905, in his paper on the\nlight-quantum hypothesis [E13], gave that equation its only fitting name: Boltz-\nmann's principle. Einstein once said to a student of his: 'Boltzmann's work is not easy\nto read. However, it is very doubtful whether in the years from\n1901 to 1904, when he did his own work on this subject, Einstein knew either this\npaper or the one of 1868, in which Boltzmann had introduced his first definition\nof probability.\nIt must have been difficult for Einstein to get hold of scientific journals.:):\nYet Einstein was acquainted with some of Maxwell's and Boltzmann's achieve-\nments. From the\nsingle reference in Einstein's paper, it is clear how much he could have learned\nabout their work. Also, it seems possible to me that Einstein knew of\n*See especially Klein's memoir [K3] for a discussion of Boltzmann's style. However, it may be that Einstein did see one of the German\ntranslations of Maxwell's Theory of Heat, dating from the 1870s. Thus Einstein did not know the true gaps in the\narguments of Maxwell and, especially, of Boltzmann; nor did he accidentally fill\nthem. The reading of Einstein's paper [E10] is not facilitated by the absence of\nan explicit statement as to what, in his opinion, the gaps actually were. The paper is competent and\nneither very interesting nor, by Einstein's own admission [E2], very well written.\nIt was not until 1910 that, for the first time, Einstein's 'derivation' was criticized\nin the literature.\nEinstein's reply to Hertz, also written in 1910 [E2] is remarkable as well.' The latter\nis contained in the only paper Einstein completed in 1904 [El2].* It is indeed a\n*For other discussions of Einstein's 1902-4 papers, see [K4] and [K5].\nIt is interesting but not all that surprising that in 1903 and 1904 Einstein, in\nhis isolation, had missed the point about time reversal. However, the exchange between\nEinstein and Hertz took place in 1910, when Einstein was a professor at Zurich\n(and taught the kinetic theory of heat during the summer semester of that year\n[S8]). * One can only conclude that Einstein did not pay much\nattention when he replied to Hertz.\nAs a postscript to the issue of the second law, it is fitting to recall the first\npersonal exchange between Einstein and Ehrenfest, which took place in Prague\nin February 1912. The Einsteins had come to the train to meet the Ehrenfests.\nWhat was the harvest of Einstein's scientific efforts up to this point.\nNothing indicates Einstein's flowering in 1905, which begins with his very next\npaper. In the years\n1902 to 1904, Einstein may not have grasped the awesome problems\u2014still a sub-\nject of active research\u2014which have to be coped with in giving the second law a\nfoundation which stands the tests of requisite mathematical rigor.\nIn the opening paragraphs of Einstein's paper of 1904 [E12], reference is made\nto Eq. Einstein turned to fluctuations for the first time in 1904,\nwhen he considered a system with variable energy E in thermal equilibrium with\na very large second system at temperature T. In 1904 Einstein deduced a\nformula for the mean square energy fluctuation\nof the first system.11 with respect to /3, he obtained\nThe quantity (\u00ab2) (Einstein noted) is a measure for the thermal stability of the\nsystem.,\n'Einstein used a symbol other than k.\nNevertheless, in 1904 Einstein had already taken a bold new step (of which he\nwas aware): he had applied statistical reasonings to radiation.\nIn May 1905, Einstein was again busy with fluctuations, though in a different\nstyle, when he did his work on Brownian motion, to be discussed in Chapter 5.\nThe remainder of the present chapter is devoted to a discussion of Einstein's gen-\neral views on statistical physics, in 1905 and in the years following.\nDuring the years 1905 to 1920, Einstein stated_more than once his displeasure\nwith the handling of probability by others. Einstein found this near-coincidence pleasing.\n**Rayleigh had done so before him (see Section 19b), but I do not believe that Einstein knew that\nin 1904.*) Einstein derived Eq.3), which he wrote in the form\n(it took until 1909 before Einstein would write k instead of R/N) implies that a\nreversible change from a state 'a' to a state 'b' satisfies\nLet the system consist of subsystems 1,2,. Einstein was therefore quite right in saying that Eq.\nAfter 1910, critical remarks on the statistical method are no longer found in\nEinstein's papers. A year before his death, Einstein paid Gibbs the highest compliment.\nAt the end of Section 4a, I mentioned that Einstein preferred to think of prob-\nability in a phenomenological way, without recourse to statistical mechanics. To begin\nwith, it needs to be stressed that Boltzmann's principle was as sacred to Einstein\nas the law of conservation of energy [E54]. In 1909, Einstein gave a new derivation, this one all his own [E24]. The difficulties encountered in separating the two questions are seen\nnowhere better than in a comment Einstein made in 1909.* Neither Einstein, deeply respectful and\nat the same time critical of both men, nor anyone else in 1909 could have foreseen\nhow odd it would appear, late in the twentieth century, to see the efforts of Boltz-\nmann and Planck lumped together in one phrase.\nIn summary, Einstein's work on statistical mechanics prior to 1905 is memo-\nrable first because of his derivation of the energy fluctuation formula and second\nbecause of his interest in the volume dependence of thermodynamic quantities,\n* Planck's counting is discussed in Section 19a.' His critical\nposition in regard to Boltzmann's second definition may have led him to replace\nthe 'Boltzmann logic,' W \u2014\u00bb S, by the 'Einstein logic,' S \u2014*\u2022 W. These\napplications are the main topic of the next chapter, where we meet Einstein in the\nyear of his emergence, 1905. Born in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (P. Einstein, [Bl], p.

As a last preparatory step\ntoward Einstein's analysis, I must touch briefly on what was known about dilute\nsolutions in the late nineteenth century.\nThe connection conjectured by Pfeffer was found by Einstein and reported in his\ndoctoral thesis, with the help of the laws found by van 't Hoff. The Doctoral Thesis\nIn his PhD thesis, Einstein described a new theoretical method for determining\nmolecular radii and Avogadro's number. From a comparison of his final equations\nwith data on sugar solutions in water, he found that\nThe printed version of his thesis [E3] carries the dedication 'to my friend Marcel\nGrossman' and gives April 30, 1905, as the completion date. Einstein did not sub-\nmit his dissertation to the dean of the philosophical faculty, Section II, at the\nUniversity of Zurich until July 20 [E4]. More important, probably, was the fact that, between April and July,\nEinstein was rather busy with other things: during those months he completed his\nfirst papers on Brownian motion and on the special theory of relativity. On July 24* the dean forwarded to the faculty for their\n'Einstein later recalled that, after having been told that the manuscript was too short, he added one\nsentence, whereupon it was accepted [S2]. The faculty\napproved (Burkhardt had failed to note a rather important mistake in Einstein's\ncalculations\u2014but that comes later). Einstein was now Herr Doktor.\nIt is not sufficiently realized that Einstein's thesis is one of his most fundamental\npapers. Histories and biographies invariably refer to 1905 as the miraculous year\nbecause of his articles on relativity, the light-quantum, and Brownian motion. It was published [E5] only after Einstein\nsupplied a brief addendum in January 1906 (I shall refer to this paper as the\n1906 paper).\nIn the appendix to the 1906 paper, Einstein gave a new and (as turned out\nlater) improved value for TV:\nQuite apart from the fundamental nature of some results obtained in the thesis,\nthere is another reason why this paper is of uncommon interest: it has had more\nwidespread practical applications than any other paper Einstein ever wrote.\nThe history of Einstein's influence on later works, as expressed by the frequency\nof citations of his papers, offers several striking examples. Of the eleven scientific\narticles published by any author before 1912 and cited most frequently between\n1961 and 1975, four are by Einstein. At the top of the list of Einstein's scientific articles cited\nmost heavily during the years 1970 to 1974 is the 1906 paper. It was quoted four\ntimes as often as Einstein's first survey article of 1916 on general relativity and\neight times as often as his 1905 paper on the light-quantum [C5]. It is nevertheless obvious that there must be valid\nreasons for the popularity of Einstein's thesis. Einstein might have enjoyed hearing this, since he was\nquite fond of applying physics to practical situations.\nLet us consider Einstein's Doktorarbeit in some detail. Then, Einstein showed, the flow can\nstill be described by Eq. Einstein\nhad available to him values for rf/rj for dilute solutions of sugar in water, and <p\nTHE REALITY OF MOLECULES 91\nand m were also known.\nThe next thing that Einstein of course did (in the spirit of Loschmidt*) was\nfind a second connection between N and a. Now, Einstein reasoned, according to van 't Hoff's\nlaw, Eq. The only nineteenth century method for finding N and a that Einstein discussed\nin his 1915 review article on kinetic theory [E6] was the one by Loschmidt.12 was discovered in Australia at\npractically the same time Einstein did his thesis work.12 should properly be called the Suth-\nerland-Einstein relation.\nAs to the contents of Einstein's thesis, all was quiet for the five years following\nits publication. Bacelin, a pupil of Jean Baptiste Perrin's, informed\nEinstein of measurements which gave a value for 77* that was too high to be com-\npatible with Eq. Upon hearing this news, Einstein set one of his own pupils to work, who\ndiscovered that there was an elementary but nontrivial mistake in the derivation\nof Eq. The correct result is [E7]\nWith the same data that Einstein had used earlier to obtain Eq.\nIn conclusion, it is now known that Einstein's Eq. Nevertheless, the expla-\n* Einstein's papers on Brownian motion as well as the 1906 paper have been collected in a handy\nlittle book by Fiirth [Fl, F2]. In a lecture entitled 'The Crises of Mathematical\nPhysics,' given before the Congress of Arts and Science in St. In 1905, Einstein was blissfully unaware of\nthe detailed history of Brownian motion. At that time, he knew neither Poincare's\nwork on relativity nor the latter's dicta 'On the Motion Required by the Molec-\nular Kinetic Theory of Heat of Particles Suspended in Fluids at Rest,' as Einstein\nentitled his first paper on Brownian motion [E2].'\nThis paper, received by the Annalen der Physik on May 11, 1905, marks the\nthird occasion in less than two months on which Einstein makes a fundamental\ndiscovery bearing on the determination of Avogadro's number. Incidentally, neither in his\nthesis nor in his Brownian motion paper does Einstein mention that in 1905 he\nhad made not just one but several proposals for determining N.\nEinstein was still not done with the invention of new ways for obtaining Avo-\ngadro's number. This was not just because of Einstein's first\npaper on Brownian motion or of any single good determination of N. Einstein's First Paper on Brownian Motion. (For\nsimplicity, Einstein treats the motion as a one-dimensional problem.\nEinstein's paper immediately drew widespread attention. In the same letter Roentgen also expressed great interest\nin Einstein's work on Brownian motion, asked him for his opinion on Gouy's\nideas and added, 'It is probably difficult to establish harmony between [Brownian\nmotion] and the second law of thermodynamics' [R6]. It is hard to imagine that\nEinstein would not have replied to such a distinguished colleague. Unfortunately,\nEinstein's answer (if there was one) has not been located. All the main physics of the first Einstein\npaper on Brownian motion is contained in Eq. In 1905 Einstein,\nmotivated by his reflections on Brownian motion, gave a new derivation of the\ndiffusion equation.12, assume (Einstein said) that\nthe suspended particles move independently of each other.\nToday we would say that, in 1905, Einstein treated diffusion as a Markovian\nprocess (so named after Andrei Andreievich Markov, who introduced the so-called\nMarkov chains in 1906), thereby establishing a link between the random walk of\na single particle and the diffusion of many particles. I give next a brief review of the main points contained\nin Einstein's later papers on Brownian motion.\n1) December 1905 [E8]. Having been informed by colleagues that the consid-\nerations of the preceding paper indeed fit, as to order of magnitude, with the\nexperimental knowledge on Brownian motion, Einstein entitles his new paper 'On\nthe Theory of Brownian Motion. Einstein raises and answers the following question.\n4) 1908. At the suggestion of the physical chemist Richard Lorenz, Einstein\nwrites an elementary expose of the theory of Brownian motion [E12].\nEinstein's relation (Eq.\nThe rapid experimental confirmation of Einstein's theory by a new generation\nof experiments, in particular the key role of Jean Perrin and his school, has been\ndescribed by Nye [Nl]. It is remarkable that the method\nproposed by Einstein in his thesis is missing. I mentioned earlier that a commu-\nnication by a pupil of Perrin had led Einstein to discover a mistake in his thesis.\nPerrin must have known about this, since Einstein wrote to him shortly afterward\nto thank him for this information and to inform him of the correct result [El3].\nEinstein's very decent value for . Its absence\nin Perrin's book indicates that Einstein's doctoral thesis was not widely appreci-\nated in the early years. This is also evident from a brief note published by Einstein\nin 1920 [El4] for the sole purpose of drawing attention to his erratum published\nin 1911 [E7] 'which till now seems to have escaped the attention of all who work\nin this field.'\n'I had believed it to be impossible to investigate Brownian motion so precisely,'\nEinstein wrote to Perrin from Zurich late in 1909 [El5]. This letter also shows\nthat, by that time, Einstein's preoccupation had moved to the quantum theory.'\nThe foregoing account of Einstein's work on Brownian motion emphasizes its\nrole in securing general acceptance of the reality of molecules. That, however, was\nnot the only thing nor, in Einstein's own opinion, the most important thing that\nhis theory of Brownian motion did for the development of physics. Einstein and Smoluchowski; Critical Opalescence\nIf Marian Ritter von Smolan-Smoluchowski had been only an outstanding theo-\nretical physicist and not a fine experimentalist as well, he would probably have\nbeen the first to publish a quantitative theory of Brownian motion.*\nIt is quite remarkable how often Smoluchowski and Einstein simultaneously\nand independently pursued similar if not identical problems. In 1904 Einstein\nworked on energy fluctuations [El7], Smoluchowski on particle number fluctua-\ntions [S5] of an ideal gas. Einstein completed his first paper on Brownian motion\nin May 1905; Smoluchowski his in July 1906 [S3].\nUnlike Einstein, Smoluchowski was fully conversant with the nineteenth cen-\n*For a detailed account of the life and work of Smoluchowski, the reader is referred to the biography\nby Teske [T4], in which the Einstein-Smoluchowski correspondence referred to hereafter is repro-\nduced. Indeed, Smoluchowski's paper of 1906 contains a critique of\nall explanations of the phenomenon prior to Einstein's.\nSmoluchowski began his 1906 paper [S3] by referring to Einstein's two articles\nof 1905: 'The findings [of those papers] agree completely with some results which\nI had . In\nany case, Smoluchowski's paper is an outstanding contribution to physics, even\nthough the priority of Einstein is beyond question (as Smoluchowski himself\npointed out [S6]).\nSix letters between Einstein and Smoluchowski have survived. The correspondence begins with a note in 1908\nby Einstein informing Smoluchowski that he has sent Smoluchowski some reprints\nand requesting some reprints of Smoluchowski's work [E18]. The next commu-\nnication, in November 1911, is again by Einstein and deals with a new subject to\nwhich both men had been drawn: critical opalescence. However, he had not quite\nunderstood Einstein's argument. Einstein objected by letter\n[El9].*\nAfter Smoluchowski's death, Sommerfeld [S12] and Einstein [E16] wrote obit-\nuaries in praise of a good man and a great scientist. Einstein called him an inge-\nnious man of research and a noble and subtle human being.\nFinally:\nEinstein's paper on critical opalescence and the blue of the sky was written in\nOctober 1910.

This letter (not reproduced in his collected papers) was\nwritten when Maxwell had less than eight months to live and Einstein was five\ndays old. In a lecture before the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, Kelvin\nreferred to the experiment as 'carried out with most searching care to secure a\ntrustworthy result' and characterized its outcome as a nineteenth century cloud\nover the dynamic theory of light [Kl]. Nevertheless, on May 25, 1921, shortly before his\ndeparture from the United States, Einstein paid a visit to Miller in Cleveland,\nwhere they talked matters over [S5].\n114 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nlished [M10]. The outcome\nof all this was that Miller received a thousand dollar prize for his Kansas City\npaper from the American Association for the Advancement of Science [L6]\u2014pre-\nsumably in part an expression of the resistance to relativity which could still be\nfound in some quarters [Bl]\u2014while Einstein got flooded with telegrams and let-\nters asking him to comment. Oswald\nVeblen, a professor of mathematics at Princeton, had overheard Einstein's com-\nment about the subtlety of the Lord. In 1930 Veblen wrote to Einstein, asking his\npermission to have this statement chiseled in the stone frame of the fireplace in the\ncommon room of Fine Hall, the newly constructed mathematics building at the\nuniversity [VI]. Einstein consented.\nLet us now move back to the times when Einstein was still virtually unknown\nand ask how Michelson reacted to Einstein's special theory of relativity and what\ninfluence the Michelson-Morley experiment had on Einstein's formulation of\nthat theory in 1905.\nfin his reply to Veblen, Einstein gave the following interpretation of his statement.\nLet us turn to the influence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on Einstein's\ninitial relativity paper [E5]. The importance of this question goes far beyond the\nminor issue of whether Einstein should have added a footnote at some place or\nother. Rather, its answer will help us to gain essential insights into Einstein's\nthinking and will prepare us for a subsequent discussion of the basic differences\nin the approaches of Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare.\nMichelson is mentioned neither in the first nor in any of Einstein's later\nresearch papers on special relativity.\nNone of this should be construed to mean that Einstein at any time underrated\nthe importance of the experiment. In 1907 Einstein was the first to write a review\narticle on relativity [E7], the first paper in which he went to the trouble of giving\na number of detailed references. Michelson and Morley are mentioned in that\nreview, in a semipopular article Einstein wrote in 1915 [E8], again in the Prince-\nton lectures of 1921 [El], and in the book The Meaning of Relativity [E9] (which\ngrew out of the Princeton lectures), where Einstein called the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment the most important one of all the null experiments on the aether drift.\nHowever, neither in the research papers nor in these four reviews does Einstein\never make clear whether before 1905 he knew of the Michelson-Morley experi-\nment. I have come across only one letter,\nwritten in 1923, by Michelson to Einstein [M13] and none by Einstein to\nMichelson. In that letter, Michelson, then head of the physics department at the\nUniversity of Chicago, offers Einstein a professorship at Chicago. On January 15, 1931, at a dinner given in Einstein's honor\nat the Atheneum of Cal Tech, Einstein publicly addressed Michelson in person\nIl6 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nfor the first and last time: 'I have come among men who for many years have been\ntrue comrades with me in my labors. It was you\nwho led the physicists into new paths, and through your marvelous experimental\nwork paved the way for the development of the theory of relativity. Lorentz and FitzGerald out of which the special theory of\nrelativity developed' [E10]. On July 17, 1931, Einstein, back in Berlin, gave a speech in Michelson's\nmemory before the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Berlin [Ell]. In Pasadena, Einstein had asked Michelson why he had\nspent so much effort on high-precision measurements of the light velocity.\nNevertheless, the answers to both questions\u2014did Einstein know of Michelson's\nwork before 1905. did it influence his creation of the special theory of\nrelativity. We know this from discussions between\nShankland and Einstein in the 1950s and from an address entitled 'How I Created\nthe Relativity Theory' given by Einstein on December 14, 1922, at Kyoto Uni-\nversity (and referred to in what follows as the Kyoto address). Let us first note\ntwo statements made by Einstein to Shankland, recorded by Shankland soon after\nthey were made, and published by him some time later [S6], as well as part of a\nletter which Einstein wrote to Shankland [S7]. Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S. 'I asked Professor Einstein when he had\nfirst heard of Michelson and his experiment.\" However, Einstein said\nthat in the years 1905-1909, he thought a great deal about Michelson's result, in\nhis discussion with Lorentz and others in his thinking about general relativity.\nc) December 1952, letter by Einstein to Shankland. Lorentz's decisive investigation of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (1895) with which I was acquainted before developing the spe-\ncial theory of relativity. (Einstein was not well in the years 1950-2 and\nalready knew that he did not have much longer to live.) There is an evident incon-\nsistency between Einstein's words of February 1950 and his two later statements.\nIt seems sensible to attach more value to the later comments, made upon further\nreflection, and therefore to conclude that Einstein did know of Michelson and\nMorley before 1905.\nSecond, there is Einstein's opinion that aberration and the Fizeau experiment\nwere enough for him. This is the most crucial statement Einstein ever made on\nthe origins of the special theory of relativity.\nIn order to appreciate how radically Einstein departed from the ancestral views\non these issues, it is necessary to compare his position with the 'decisive investi-\ngation' published by Lorentz in 1895 [L4]. In rejecting these explanations\nof aberration and the Fizeau experiment, Einstein therefore chose to take leave of\na first-order terra firma which had been established by the practitioners, limited\nin number but highly eminent and influential, of electromagnetic theory. Note also that this experiment was\ndiscussed at length in Lorentz's paper of 1895 and that Einstein was familiar with\nthis paper before 1905. He knew Einstein\npersonally from those days. He also translated a number of Einstein's papers into Japanese.\nIn his first paper on relativity, Einstein mentions 'the failed attempts to detect\na motion of the earth relative to the \"light-medium\" ' without specifying what\nattempts he had in mind. Yet this 'unaccountable result' did affect his thinking and thus\na new question arises: Why, on the whole, was Einstein so reticent to acknowledge\nthe influence of Michelson on him. What Einstein Knew.\nThe post-Maxwell, pre-Einstein attitude which eventually became preponderant\nwas that electrodynamics is Maxwell's equations plus a specification of the charge\nand current densities contained in these equations plus a conjecture on the nature\nof the aether. There were the aethers\nof Fresnel, Gauchy, Stokes, Neumann, MacCulIagh, Kelvin, Planck, and proba-\nbly others, distinguished by such properties as degree of homogeneity and com-\n*In a thoughtful article on Einstein and the Michelson-Morley experiment, Holton [H2] raised the\npossibility that Einstein might have had in mind other null effects known by then, such as the absence\nof double refraction [B2, Rl] and the Trouton-Noble experiment [Tl]. Rather s Einstein's resolution of the diffi-\nculties besetting the electrodynamics of moving bodies is cast in an all-embracing\nframework of a new kinematics. A\nfinal comparison of the contributions of Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare will be\ndeferred until Chapter 8.\nAs to Einstein himself, in his first relativity paper he mentions only three phys-\nicists by name: Maxwell, Hertz, and Lorentz. It follows\u2014as we shall\nsee\u2014that in 1905 Einstein did not know of Lorentz transformations. (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether. Lorentz. This paper also marks the beginning of\nLorentz's road toward the Lorentz transformations, our next subject.\nAs has been noted repeatedly, in 1905 Einstein knew of Lorentz's work only\nup to 1895. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned.\n1904. However, as far as the\nhistory of relativistic kinematics is concerned, the story of Lorentz as precursor to\nEinstein is herewith complete.'\nThe account of Einstein's precursors ends here, on a note of indecision. But prior to 1905 there\nwas no relativity theory. Let us now turn to what Poincare did next, not as a\nprecursor to Einstein but essentially simultaneously with him. Poincare, one of the\nvery few true leaders in mathematics and mathematical physics of his day, knew,\nof course, the electromagnetic theory in all its finesses.\nJune 30, 1905. Einstein's first paper on relativity is received by the Annalen\nder Physik.\nJuly, 1905.\nI shall return later to the efforts by Lorentz in 1904 and by Poincare in 1905\nto give a theory of the electron. I shall now let their case rest until the discussion of\nEinstein's first two papers on the subject has been completed.\nAs a last step preparatory to the account of Einstein's discovery of relativity, I\nshould like to mention what little we know about his thoughts on the subject prior\nto 1905. Einstein before 1905\nEinstein's curiosity in electromagnetic theory goes back at least to his Pavia days\nof 1895, which followed his escape from the hated high school in Munich. The\nfollowing brief and rather disconnected remarks bear on his interest in electro-\ndynamics during the decade preceding his creation of the special theory of\nrelativity.* In 1895 Einstein sent a manuscript entitled Uber die\nUntersuchung des Atherzustandes im magnetischen Felde (On the Examination\nof the State of the Aether in a Magnetic Field) to his uncle Caesar Koch in Bel-\ngium. This paper\u2014which Einstein never published\u2014was accompanied by a cov-\nering letter in which he wrote: '[The manuscript] deals with a very special theme\nand is .'\n*In 1950, Einstein dated this manuscript to be from 1894 or 1895. It was sent to Caesar Koch in\n1895, since in its covering letter Einstein tells of his intent to go to the ETH and adds, 'In the next\nletter I shall write you what may come of this. Evidently Einstein believed in an\naether at that time.' Thus, the young Einstein discov-\nered independently the qualitative properties of self-induction (a term he did not\nuse). In his final autobiographical note [El2], Einstein\nwrote, 'During that year [sometime between October 1895 and the early fall of\n1896] in Aarau the question came to me: If one runs after a light wave with [a\nvelocity equal to the] light velocity, then one would encounter a time-independent\nwavefield. Also, in his more extensive autobio-\ngraphical notes, published in 1949, Einstein remarked that 'after ten years of\nreflection such a principle [special relativity] resulted from [this] paradox upon\nwhich I had already hit at the age of sixteen' [E6]. Since Rudolf Kayser, Einstein's son-in-law and biog-\nrapher, was himself not a physicist, it is hard to believe that the following lines\nfrom the biography could have come from anyone but Einstein himself. That his intention was that of other important theorists, Einstein did\nnot yet know. He was at that time unacquainted with the positive contributions,\nof some years back, of the great Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, and with the\nsubsequently famous attempt of Michelson.\nAs to electromagnetic theory, Einstein was not offered a course on this subject\nin his ETH days. A letter by Einstein to Grossmann, written in\n1901 from Winterthur, informs us that aether drift experiments were still on Ein-\nstein's mind: 'A new and considerably simpler method for investigating the motion\nof matter relative to the light-aether has occurred to me. Since there\nare no preliminaries to this statement, one gains the impression that Grossmann\nknew something about a previous method which Einstein must have had in mind\nwhen they were together at the ETH.\nThis letter also shows that Einstein still believed in an aether as late as 1901. On the evening of December 5, 1903, Albert Einstein,\ntechnical expert third class with provisional appointment, held a lecture in the\nconference room of the Hotel Storchen in Bern before the Naturforschende\nGesellschaft Bern. Finally I quote another part of the translation from\nGerman to Japanese to English of the Kyoto address that Einstein gave in 1922. In the same lecture Einstein remarked, 'It is never easy to talk\nabout how I got to the theory of relativity because there would be various con-\ncealed complexities to motivate human thinking and because they worked with\ndifferent weights' [Ol]. Even with this admonition in mind, it would seem that\nthe following is a fair summary of Einstein's work and thoughts on electrody-\nnamics prior to 1905.\nIt is virtually certain, however, that prior to 1905 Einstein was aware of the\n1900 Paris address by Poincare and that he had also read Poincare's remark of\n1898 concerning the lack of intuition about the equality of two time intervals.\nBefore 1905 Einstein, together with his friends of the Akademie Olympia, did\nindeed read some of Poincare's general essays on science: 'In Bern I had regular\nphilosophical reading and discussion evenings, together with K. This last book, the only one of the four to\nappear before 1905, is the one Einstein and his friends read in Bern.' I stress that Einstein and his friends did much more than\njust browse through Poincare's writings.\nI must say more about Einstein and Poincare and shall do so in Chapter 8 after\nhaving discussed Einstein's creation of special relativity in the next chapter.), A Debate on the Theory of Relativity. 74.

Small wonder that Einstein would draw his friend's attention\nto the kinematic part.'\nThe friend in Bern was Besso, close to Einstein since the student days in Zurich,\ncolleague at the patent office since 1904.

As to the completion of the work\nin five weeks, since the paper was received by the Annalen der Physik on June\n30, Einstein's total concentration on relativity followed immediately upon the\nrelief of his having finished three major projects in statistical physics: the paper\non the light-quantum, his thesis, and the paper on Brownian motion, completed\non March 17, April 30, and around May 10, respectively.\nIn 1905 Einstein's belief in 'the truth of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations' was\nnot unqualified, as we shall see later.f Einstein opted for the alter-\nnative: 'The phenomena of electrodynamics and mechanics possess no properties\ncorresponding to the idea of absolute rest' [El]. Transcribed rather freely, one might\nsay that Einstein cared for neither the logical disconnectedness of electricity and\nmagnetism nor the asymmetry between the two coordinate systems just described.\nI argued in Chapter 6 that Einstein rejected the nineteenth century explanations\nof the first-order aether drift effects as unconvincing and artificial and that the\nsecond-order Michelson-Morley paradox was to some extent secondary to him.\nAdd to this his remark that 'Maxwell's electrodynamics\u2014as usually understood\nat the present time\u2014when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which\nare not inherent in the phenomena' and one has the motivation for the June paper:\nEinstein was driven to the special theory of relativity mostly by aesthetic argu-\nments, that is, arguments of simplicity.\n^1 do not copy Einstein verbatim.\nWhat is so captivating about the Einstein of 1905 is the apparent ease and the\nfraicheur with which he introduces new ideas., the Michel-\nson-Morley result, which Einstein did mention for the first time in this 1907\npaper]. In an unpublished manuscript,f written in 1921, Einstein spells out\nthree additional assumptions which are made in this reasoning: (1) Homogeneity:\nthe properties of rods and clocks depend neither on their position nor on the time\nat which they move, but only on the way in which they move. The postulates together with these prescriptions fully specify Einstein's\ntheory of special relativity.\nEinstein obtained this relation by deriving the Lorentz transformation from his\npostulates.8) from first\nprinciples occurs for the first time in Einstein's paper, however.*\nEinstein also pointed out that transformations of the type shown in Eq.8 with a velocity v given by\nTwenty years later, Einstein heard something about the Lorentz group that\ngreatly surprised him.

(For Einstein's own derivations, see [SI].\nIn 1911 Einstein still had to explain: 'The question whether the Lorentz con-\ntraction does or does not exist is confusing. Indeed,\nas Einstein himself noted later [E6], \"no contradiction in the foundations of\nthe theory can be constructed from this result\" since C2 but not C, has expe-\nrienced acceleration.'

As I have already\nintimated, Einstein's belief in the validity of the Maxwell-Lorentz electrody-\nnamics was strong but not unqualified.\nNot just in 1905 but throughout his life Einstein considered quantum theory as\na preliminary to a true theory and relativity as the royal road toward such a the-\nory.' In the fall of 1943 Einstein\nreceived a visit from Julian Boyd, then the librarian of the Princeton University\nlibrary. Einstein completed this\ntask on November 21, 1943.

Some time after the\nappearance of the paper, Albert Einstein received a letter from Berlin. The joy of the young scientist was especially great\nbecause the recognition of his activities came from one of the greatest physicists of\nthat time' [M2]. Maja also mentioned that some time thereafter letters began to\narrive addressed to 'Professor Einstein at the University of Bern.' During the winter semester of 1905-6, Planck pre-\nsented Einstein's theory in the physics colloquium in Berlin. As a result von Laue became another early\nconvert to relativity, published in 1907 the pretty note [LI] on the Fizeau exper-\niment, did more good work on the special theory, and became the author of the\nfirst monograph on special relativity [L4]. Planck also discussed some implications\nof the 'Relativtheorie' in a scientific meeting held in September 1906 [P8]. The\nfirst PhD thesis on relativity was completed under his direction [M3].\nThe first paper bearing on relativity but published by someone other than Ein-\nstein was by Planck [P6], as best I know.\nAmong other early papers on relativity, I mention one by Ehrenfest in 1907\n[El7], in which is asked for the first time the important question: How does one\napply Lorentz transformations to a rigid body.\nPlanck was also the first to apply relativity to the quantum theory. Einstein delivered himself of the\nopinion, 'I don't understand how one can walk around up there' [S3].\nThe publication of the 1905 papers on special relativity marked the beginning\nof the end of Einstein's splendid isolation at the patent office. 'The young man who met me made such\nan unexpected impression on me that I could not believe he could be the father of\nthe relativity theory,' von Laue later recalled [S2]. From Wiirzburg Johann Jakob Laub wrote to Einstein, asking if he could\nwork with him for three months [L6]; the ensuing stay of Laub in Bern led to\nEinstein's first papers published jointly with a collaborator [El8, El9]. Rudolf\nLadenburg, who became a close friend of Einstein in the Princeton years, came\nfrom Breslau (now Wroclaw). In July 1907 Planck wrote to Einstein, 'As long as the advocates of the\nrelativity principle form such a modest-sized crowd, it is doubly important for\nthem to agree with one another' [P10]. In\n1902, Minkowski, at one time Einstein's teacher in Zurich, had moved to the\nUniversity of Goettingen.\nThus began the enormous formal simplification of special relativity. Initially,\nEinstein was not impressed and regarded the transcriptions of his theory into ten-\nsor form as 'uberfliissige Gelehrsamkeit,' (superfluous learnedness).* However, in\n1912 he adopted tensor methods and in 1916 acknowledged his indebtedness to\nMinkowski for having greatly facilitated the transition from special to general\nrelativity [E20]., the relativity postulates], I\nlike to think, is the true nucleus of an electromagnetic image of the world, which,\ndiscovered by Lorentz, and further revealed by Einstein, now lies open in the full\nlight of day' [M6].\nThe rapid growth of Einstein's reputation in scientific circles dates from about\n1908. In July 1909 the University of Geneva conferred the title of doctor honoris\ncausa 'a Monsieur Einstein, Expert du Bureau Federal de la Propriete intellec-\ntuelle. Since Guye's interests centered largely on the velocity dependence of beta-\nray energies, it is probable that Einstein received this first of many honors because\nof relativity.\n* Einstein told this to V. Einstein in\nPrague. Einstein and the Special Theory After 1905\nThe fifth section of Einstein's review paper on relativity, completed in 1907, deals\nwith gravitation and contains this statement: 'The principle of the constancy of\nthe light velocity can be used also here [i. Einstein already knew then that the special theory was only a beginning\n(see Chapter 9). In addition, from\n1908 until some time in 1911 the quantum theory rather than relativity was\nuppermost in his mind (see Chapter 10).\nApart from review articles and general lectures, Einstein's work on the conse-\nquences of the special theory was over by 1909.\n1906.\n154 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\n1906.\n1907.\n1907.\n1907. Earlier Einstein had derived the expression mc2(y \u2014 1) for the kinetic\nenergy. In this paper Einstein also expresses an\nopinion concerning the bearing of his recent light-quantum hypothesis on the\nvalidity of the free Maxwell equations.\n1907. This is the transitional paper from the special to\nthe general theory of relativity. In 1910, Einstein\npublished a brief note on the nonrelativistic definition of the ponderomotive force\nin a magnetic field [E26].\nThis concludes the brief catalog of Einstein's later contributions to special rel-\nativity.\nTHE NEW KINEMATICS 155\nWe have now discussed special relativity from its nineteenth century antece-\ndents to Einstein's motivation, his paper of 1905 and its sequels, and the early\nreactions to the new theory.\nRemaining unfinished business, mainly related to the roles of Einstein, Lorentz,\nand Poincare, will be discussed in Chapter 8.' Thus he discovered the electromagnetic mass /i, though he did not\ngive it that name.\nAs for Abraham, he was a very gifted theoretical physicist (Einstein seriously\nconsidered him as his successor when in 1914 he left the ETH for Berlin), but it\nwas his fate to be at scientific odds with Einstein, in regard both to the special\ntheory and the general theory of relativity\u2014and to lose in both instances. Stimulated by the new theoretical devel-\nopments, he refined his experiments and in 1906 announced new results: The\nmeasurements are incompatible with the Lorentz-Einstein postulate. Einstein was unmoved: 'Herr Kaufmann has\ndetermined the relation between [electric and magnetic deflection] of /3-rays with\nadmirable care.' The final experimental verdict\nin favor of relativity came in the years 1914-16.\n160 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nReferences\nAl. Abraham, Phys. Born, Die Relativitatstheorie Einsteins.

To Einstein they\ncame rather abruptly, but only after years of unsuccessful thinking. In later years all three men, Einstein, Lorentz, and\nPoincare, reacted to the special theory of relativity in ways which arouse curiosity. Return-\ning to Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare, the questions I raised about them are the\nresult of patient reading of their papers. Einstein and the Literature. Einstein's 1907 article [El] for the Jahrbuch\nder Radioaktivitat und Elektronik was written at the invitation of Johannes Stark,\nthe founder and editor of that series. In agreeing to review relativity theory, Ein-\nstein wrote to Stark, 'I should note that unfortunately I am not in a position to\norient myself about everything that has been published on this subject, because\nthe library is closed in my free time. Apart from my own papers, I know of a\npaper by Lorentz (1904), one by Cohn, one by Mosengeil, and two by Planck. In his reply to Einstein's letter, Stark mentioned work by Planck,\nvon Laue, and himself and added, 'Apart from these papers and those mentioned\nby you, I do not know of any others either' [SI]. Thus neither Einstein nor Stark\nwas aware of Poincare's long paper bearing on relativity, completed in July 1905\nand published in the 1906 volume of Rendiconti del Circolo matematico di\nPalermo [PI]. Nevertheless, especially in view of\nthe exchange between Einstein and Stark, I see no grounds for thinking that in\n1907 Einstein knew of Poincare's paper and chose to ignore it.\nI believe, however, that Einstein's complaint about his difficulties in getting\nhold of books and journals, while no doubt genuine, is only a secondary factor in\nthe understanding of his handling of existing literature.\nHowever, in view of the fact that the questions under consideration are treated\nhere from a new point of view, I believed I could dispense with a literature search\nwhich would be very troublesome for me, especially since it is to be hoped that\nother authors will fill this gap, as was commendably done by Herr Planck and\nHerr Kaufmann on the occasion of my first paper on the principle of relativity'\n[E5].**\nThe period during which Einstein was unaware of Poincare's technical writing\non relativity now stretches into 1908. I noted in Section 6b that by 1905 Einstein\nhad already read Poincare's La Science et I'Hypothese, in which it is conjectured\nthat the undetectability of the earth's motion relative to the aether should hold to\nfSee Section 7c.\"\n** Einstein was evidently able to get to the literature if he set his mind to it. I would not be surprised if Einstein had copied\nthat reference from one of Lorentz's papers. Also, in 1906 Einstein mentioned [E6] a paper by\nPoincare [P2] which came to his attention because it appeared in a Festschrift for Lorentz. It cannot be said, however, that the content of Einstein's June\n1905 paper depends in any technical sense on these important remarks by Poin-\ncare. Others in Einstein's position might perhaps have chosen to mention Poincare\nat the earliest opportunity. However, it does not seem to me that Einstein had\ncompelling reasons to do so in 1905. I shall return soon to what Einstein had to\nsay about Poincare in later years. Here I note that Poincare's name appears only\nonce in a paper by Einstein on relativity, to wit, in 'Geometric und Erfahrung,'\nthe text of a lecture he gave in 1921 on general relativity [E7] in which he praises\n'der tiefe und scharfsinnige Poincare,' the deep and sharp-witted P. Despite this considerable delay,\n'Einstein's principle of relativity [has not] received an adequate treatment' [L2]. With his\ncustomary clarity, he stated his own credo in the course of lectures given at the\nTeyler Foundation in Haarlem in 1913 [L3]:\n'According to Einstein, it has no meaning to speak of motion relative to the\naether.\nAs I understand Lorentz, he was a leader in theoretical physics who fully\ngrasped all the physical and mathematical aspects of the special theory of relativity\nbut who nevertheless could not quite take leave of a beloved classical past.\nEinstein and Poincare always spoke in praise of him, Lorentz always reciprocated. Poincare does not describe Einstein's theory. probably never became a relativist at all, and only paid lip service\nto Einstein at times, to avoid arguments' [B2].' It is evident that as late as 1909 Poincare did not\nknow that the contraction of rods is a consequence of the two Einstein postulates. It is likewise the case in a\nsemipopular account of relativity which Poincare wrote in 1908 [P5].\nMy own assessment of Poincare's contributions to relativity coincides with what\nwas said about him during the opening remarks of the meeting in Paris of the\nSociete Francaise de Philosophic, referred to earlier: 'The solution anticipated by\nPoincare was given by Einstein in his memoir of 1905 on special relativity. Whittaker and the History of Relativity.\nEinstein's reaction was, 'I do not have to read the thing.\n*Whittaker's obituary of Einstein written for the Royal Society is no work of art either [W3]. Lorentz and Einstein. As Einstein told me more than once, Lorentz was\nto him the most well-rounded and harmonious personality he had met in his entire\nlife. Einstein's thoughts and feelings about Lorentz were a blend of respect, love,\nand awe. In a memorial service held at the Univer-\nsity of Leiden shortly after Lorentz's death, Einstein was one of the speakers: 'The\nenormous significance of his work consisted therein, that it forms the basis for the\ntheory of atoms and for the general and special theories of relativity. At that same age, Einstein had already lived in four countries\nand had held four professorships in succession.\nLorentz's esteem for Einstein was extremely high as well. In Chapter 12, I\nshall have more to relate about the interactions between these two men at the time\nthat Lorentz almost got Einstein to accept a permanent position in Holland. Poincare and Einstein. Why did Poincare not mention Einstein in his\nGoettingen lectures. Why is there no paper by Poincare in which Einstein and\nrelativity are linked. It is impossible that in 1909\n170 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\n(the year he spoke in Goettingen) he would never have heard of Einstein's activ-\nities in this area. Could it be that Poincare had\nhad a mere glance at Einstein's papers and had concluded too hastily that he knew\nall that already and that there was nothing new there. In my opinion, it is more significant that Poincare until\nshortly before his death remained silent about Einstein than that Einstein until\nshortly before his death remained silent about Poincare. In closing the case of\nPoincare and Einstein, I offer their final statements with only minor comments of\nmy own.\nAlexander Moszkowski begins his biography of Einstein [ M2] by recalling that\non October 13,1910, Poincare gave a lecture before the Berliner Wissenschaftliche\nVerein about 'die neue Mechanik' (Poincare was quite comfortable with the Ger-\nman language). 'In this lecture it happened for the first time that we heard the\nname Albert Einstein.' Alas, we are not\ntold in what way the speaker referred to Einstein.\nEinstein and Poincare met (for the first and last time, I believe) at the first\nSolvay Conference, held in Brussels in October 1911.\nShortly thereafter, the authorities at the ETH, in the course of their prepara-\ntions for offering Einstein a professorship, asked Poincare for an opinion about\nhim. Poincare replied, 'Monsieur Einstein is one of the most original minds I have\nknown; in spite of his youth he already occupies a very honorable position among\nthe leading scholars of his time.\nThat, as best I know, is the single and final judgment on Einstein that Poincare\nleft us. Twice, having met Einstein and written this letter, did he comment on\nrelativity [P7, P8]. Twice did he mention Lorentz but not Einstein, though he\nreferred to Einstein in connection with the photo effect on the second of these\noccasions.\nIn 1919, the mathematician Mittag-Leffler wrote to Einstein, asking him to\ncontribute an article to the Ada Mathematica volume in honor of Poincare [M3].\nFour months later, Einstein responded. Mittag-Leffler replied that Einstein\ncould still send a paper if he cared to do so [M4]. Two and a half months later,\nEinstein replied that obligations and travel prevented him from contributing, add-\ning that his decision 'should be considered as nothing but high respect for the task'\n[EH].\nIn the early 1950s, I once asked Einstein how Poincare's Palermo paper had\naffected his thinking. Einstein replied that he had never read that paper. Some time after Einstein's death, I asked Helen Dukas if\nshe would please look for it. In 1953 Einstein received an invitation to attend the\nforthcoming Bern celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of special relativity. In this\nletter Einstein mentions for the first time (as far as I know) Poincare's role in\nregard to the special theory: 'Hoffentlich wird dafiir gesorgt dasz die Verdienste\nvon H.**\nTwo months before his death, Einstein gave his fair and final judgment:\n'Lorentz had already recognized that the transformations named after him are\nessential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincare deepened this\ninsight still further . Toward the end of Section\n6a, I promised to comment further on Einstein's reticence in acknowledging the\ninfluence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on his thinking.\nIn a letter to an historian, written a year before his death, Einstein expressed\nhimself for the last time on this subject: 'In my own development, Michelson's\nresult has not had a considerable influence.\nJust over twenty years before Einstein wrote this late letter, just under twenty\nyears after his creation of the special theory, he gave a lecture at Oxford entitled\n'On the Method of Theoretical Physics' [E20], in the course of which he said, 'It\nis my conviction that pure mathematical construction enables us to discover the\nconcepts and the laws connecting them, which give us the key to the understanding\nof the phenomena of Nature.' It seems to me that here Einstein grossly overesti-\nmates the capabilities of the human mind, even of one as great as his own. It is a danger\nfrom which Einstein himself did not escape in his later years.\nThe emphasis on mathematics is so different from the way the young Einstein\nused to proceed.\nStepping beyond the edge of history, I offer the thought that, just barely visible,\nthe origins of Einstein's later attitude toward the discovery of concepts by purely\nmathematical thinking may go back to 1905. The kinematic part of his June paper\nhas the ideal axiomatic structure of a finished theory, a structure which had\n**'The reasoning used by Poincare was just the same as that which Einstein introduced in his first\npaper of 1905. Does this mean that Poincare knew all this before Einstein.\nAnd of course Einstein could never have been of any help in finding out. Born, The Born-Einstein Letters (I.

An Outline of Einstein's Contributions\nIn 1948, I undertook to put together the Festschrift in honor of Einstein's seven-\ntieth birthday [Rl]. In a letter to prospective contributors, I wrote, 'It is planned\nthat the first article of the volume shall be of a more personal nature and, written\nby a representative colleague, shall pay homage to Einstein on behalf of all con-\ntributors' [PI]. 'I spent ten years of my life testing that\n1905 equation of Einstein's and contrary to all my expectations, I was compelled\nin 1915 to assert its unambiguous verification in spite of its unreasonableness,\nsince it seemed to violate everything we knew about the interference of light' [Ml].\nPhysics had progressed, and Millikan had mellowed since the days of his 1915\npaper on the photoeffect, as is evidenced by what he wrote at that earlier time:\n'Einstein's photoelectric equation . Yet the semicorpuscular theory by which Einstein arrived at\nhis equation seems at present wholly untenable' [M2]; and in his next paper,\nMillikan mentioned 'the bold, not to say the reckless, hypothesis of an electro-\nmagnetic light corpuscle' [M3].\n357\n358 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nThe critical reaction to Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis of 1905 is of great\nimportance for an understanding of the early developments in quantum physics.\nIt was also a reaction without parallel in Einstein's scientific career. In regard to the quantum theory,\nhowever, Einstein almost constantly stood apart, from 1905 until his death. Einstein pursued this program\nfrom about 1920 (before the discovery of quantum mechanics. Einstein's con-\ntributions to it can be grouped under the following headings. In 1905 Einstein discovered light-quanta without\nusing Planck's law. The\ninterplay between the ideas of Planck and Einstein is discussed. In 1906 Einstein\ncompleted the first paper on quantum effects in the solid state. Einstein himself did not discuss photon momentum\nPRELIMINARIES 359\nuntil 1917. Einstein's role in these developments is dis-\ncussed in Chapter 21, which begins with Einstein's formulation in 1909 of the\nparticle-wave duality for the case of electromagnetic radiation and also contains\nan account of his discovery of the A and B coefficients and of his earliest concern\nwith the breakdown of classical causality.\nThe reader may wonder why the man who discovered the relation E = hv for\nlight in 1905 and who propounded the special theory of relativity in that same\nyear would not have stated sooner the relation p = hv/c.\n(e) Einstein's role as a key transitional figure in the discovery of wave\nmechanics will be discussed in Chapter 24.\nI shall continue the outline of Einstein's contributions to the quantum theory\nin Section 18c. The light-quan-\ntum hypothesis was considered somewhat of an aberration even by leading phys-\nicists who otherwise held Einstein in the highest esteem.\nIf Planck, Einstein, and Bohr are the fathers of the quantum theory, then Gus-\ntav Robert Kirchhoff is its grandfather. On these issues, the intellectual resistance and\nPRELIMINARIES 363\nopposition of one against the most basic views held by the other continued una-\nbated until the end of Einstein's life.\nThis debate will be one of the themes of Chapter 25, which deals with Einstein's\nobjections to quantum mechanics.\nA point made earlier bears repeating here: Einstein's own visions on physics\nissues were often in opposition to the mainstream, but they were never negative. Among these, there is one that was most dear to\nEinstein and with which he (and all of us to date) struggled in vain: the synthesis\nof quantum physics with general relativity. The assessment of\nEinstein's view of this problem, to be given in Chapter 26, must therefore neces-\nsarily be tentative. However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life. That made him the discoverer of\nthe quantum theory. As we soon shall see, this same equation was also the point\nof departure for Einstein's critique in 1905 of Planck's reasoning and for his quan-\ntum theory of specific heats. At the time of Planck's\n*In January 1905 and again in January 1906, Planck proposed Boltzmann for the Nobel prize.\nFrom the very start, Planck's results were a source of inspiration and bewil-\nderment to Einstein. In 1913,\nEinstein wrote that Planck's work 'invigorates and at the same time makes so\ndifficult the physicist's existence.\nFrom my discussions with Einstein, I know that he venerated Planck as the\ndiscoverer of the quantum theory, that he deeply respected him as a human being\nwho stood firm under the inordinate sufferings of his personal life and of his coun-\ntry, and that he was grateful to him: 'You were the first to advocate the theory of\nrelativity' [El].* In 1948, after\nPlanck's death, Einstein wrote, 'This discovery [i.

For that purpose, Einstein chose\nto reason 'im Anschluss an die Erfahrung,' phenomenologically.\nEinstein began by rederiving in his own way the familiar formula for the finite\nreversible change of entropy S at constant T for the case where n gas molecules\nin the volume v0 are confined to a subvolume v:\n(19.

We shall see in Section\n19f that Planck was not at all prepared to accept at once Einstein's reasoning,\ndespite the fact that it lent support to his own endeavors. As to Einstein himself,\nhis acceptance of Planck's Eq. Then I turn to Einstein's contribution. Finally I outline the developments\nup to 1916, by which time Einstein's predictions were confirmed.\n1905: Einstein. Opinions were divided, but\nevidently experimentalists were beginning to close in on the Einstein relation. Then, Einstein proposed, we have the relation (in modern\nnotation)\n(19.\nDuane and Hunt did not quote Einstein at all in their paper. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next. Einstein's Caution. Einstein's letters provide a rich source of his insights\ninto physics and people.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. In the earliest years following his light-quantum proposal,\nEinstein had good reasons to regard it as provisional. A man as perfectly honest as Einstein\nhad no choice but to emphasize the provisional nature of his hypothesis.\nIt is curious how often physicists believed that Einstein was ready to retract.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. Referring to the light-quanta, Millikan\nstated in 1913 that Einstein 'gave . the apparently complete success of the Einstein\nequation [for the photoeffect], the physical theory of which it was designed to be\nthe symbolic expression is found so untenable that Einstein himself, I believe, no\nlonger holds to it' [M4]. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nI often argued with Einstein about reliance on experimental evidence for con-\nfirmation of fundamental new ideas. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. One could (and\ndid and should) doubt his derivation, as, among others, Einstein did in 1905.\nEinstein himself had little to show by comparison.\nYet Einstein's apartness did not end even then.\nThis went on until the early 1920s, as is best illustrated by quoting the citation\nfor Einstein's Nobel prize in 1922: 'To Albert Einstein for his services to theoret-\nical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect'\n[A2].\nRight after March 1905, Einstein sat down and wrote his doctoral thesis. 74.

This episode came\nto an abrupt end when Einstein had a tantrum and threw a chair at the woman\nwho taught him. A book he wrote con-\ntains recollections of his early acquaintance with Einstein [Tl]. Einstein also continued to study mathematics on his own. Einstein was\ntaught the elements of Judaism at home by a distant relative [M5]. As a result of\nthis inculcation, Einstein went through an intense religious phase when he was\nabout eleven years old.\nThere is another story of the Munich days that Einstein himself would occa-\nsionally tell with some glee. Einstein\nreplied that he had done nothing wrong.\nThe preceding collection of stories about Einstein the young boy demonstrates\nthe remarkable extent to which his most characteristic personal traits were native\nrather than acquired. However, in his personal and scientific conduct, he was not a\nrebel, one who resists authority, nor\u2014except once*\u2014a revolutionary, one who\n'Einstein's one truly revolutionary contribution is his light-quantum paper of 1905.\nAnother and most important characteristic of Einstein is already evident in the\nchild quietly at play by itself: his 'apartness.\nIn October 1895 Einstein went to Zurich to take the ETH examination. For\nJost Winteler, one of his teachers and a scholar in his own right, Einstein devel-\noped great respect, for Frau Winteler a deep affection. The frontispiece photograph, taken in Aarau, shows Einstein as\na confident-looking, if not cocky, young man without a trace of the timidity of the\nearlier years.\nA brief essay by Einstein, entitled 'Mes Projets d'Avenir,' has survived from his\nAarau schooldays (reproduced on pp.\nPORTRAIT OF THE PHYSICIST AS A YOUNG MAN 41\nIn 1896 Einstein's status changed from that of German high school pupil in\nAarau to that of stateless student at the ETH. Throughout his student years, from 1896 to 1900, Einstein lived on\nan allowance of one hundred Swiss francs per month, of which he saved twenty\neach month to pay for his Swiss naturalization papers. The Einsteins moved back to Milan and\nbegan anew.\nEinstein's student days did have their pleasant moments.\n42 INTRODUCTORY\nEinstein's essay written in Aarau, for which he received the grade 3 to 4 (out of 6).\nPORTRAIT OF THE PHYSICIST AS A YOUNG MAN 43\n44 INTRODUCTORY\n'Most of the time I worked in the physical laboratory, fascinated by the direct\ncontact with observation,' Einstein later wrote about his years at the ETH [E7]. In particular, Einstein was not allowed to con-\nduct an experiment on the earth's movement against the aether [R8].* At one\npoint Weber is supposed to have said to Einstein: 'You are a smart boy, Einstein,\na very smart boy. Einstein's fascination with experiment must have been dampened.\nEinstein, in turn, was not impressed with Weber's physics courses. These few-month periods were made easy for Einstein\nbecause Marcel Grossmann made available his lecture notes, beautifully written,\nmeticulously organized.\n**For a complete list of Einstein's four-year curriculum, see [S7].\nfit is of interest for Einstein's later work on general relativity that he also attended some of Geiser's\nlectures on differential geometry [Kl, RIO).\n$1 have not found any evidence for the correspondence between Boltzmann and Einstein referred to\nin [M9] and [S9]. And so,\nin August 1900, Einstein became qualified as a Fachlehrer, together with three\nother students, who each immediately obtained positions as assistants at the ETH\n[S5].* Einstein himself was jobless.\nEarly in 1901 Einstein again tried to find a university position. I would have found one long ago if Weber had not played\na dishonest game with me' [E14]4 In March 1901 he sent a reprint of his first\npaper to Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig, along with a letter in which he\ninquired 'whether you perhaps might have use for a mathematical physicist who\nis familiar with absolute measurements' [El5]. The\nyear after that Ostwald would be the first to propose Einstein for the Nobel\nprize.\n**After Weber's death in 1912, Einstein wrote to a friend, in a way quite uncommon for him,\n'Weber's death is good for the ETH' [E10].'\n\u00a7The letters from the Einsteins to Ostwald have been reproduced in [K2].\n46 INTRODUCTORY\nFinally Einstein found a temporary job. Here is Einstein writing in Decem-\nber 1901: 'Since September 15, 1901, I am a teacher at a private school in\nSchaffhausen. This work was not\naccepted as a thesis, however, f This setback was the last one in Einstein's career. Einstein was deeply grate-\nful for this recommendation4 There the matter rested until December 11, 1901,\nwhen a vacancy at the patent office was advertised in the Schweizerisches Bundes-\nblatt. Einstein at once sent a letter of application [E20]. One of his students described him as follows: 'about five feet ten,\nbroad-shouldered, slightly stooped, a pale brown skin, a sensuous mouth, black\nmoustache, nose slightly aquiline, radiant brown eyes, a pleasant voice, speaking\n*In this same letter, Einstein also reported that he had met one of the leading German physicists.\nfl have been unable to find a response from Zurich concerning Einstein's proposed thesis. Earlier in the year, Einstein had contemplated sub-\nmitting an extended version of his first paper, on intermolecular forces, as a PhD thesis [E14]. Einstein, Solovine, and another friend, Konrad Habicht, met regularly to\ndiscuss philosophy, physics, and literature, from Plato to Dickens.*\nMeanwhile, Einstein's appointment by the Swiss federal council came through. In 1902 there was tem-\nporary friction between Einstein and his mother, who neither then nor later liked\nMileva [E23]. Hermann Einstein died on October 10,\n1902, and was buried in Milan.\nEinstein did well at the patent office. There was always enough time and energy left for his own\nphysics.\nNo one before or since has widened the horizons of physics in so short a time\nas Einstein did in 1905. His work of that year will of course be discussed at length\n*In his late sixties, Einstein remembered the days 'when we ran our happy \"Academy,\" which after\nall was less childish than those respectable ones which I got to know later from close in' [E22].\nOn April 1, 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical expert second class with\na salary raise to SF 4500. At the end of 1907 Einstein made\nthe first important strides toward the general theory of relativity (see Chapter 9). Einstein's days in Bern are not\nyet over, but a new phase is about to begin: his academic career (see further Sec-\ntion lOa).\nAt the end of his life, Einstein wrote that the greatest thing Marcel Grossman\ndid for him was to recommend him to the patent office with the help of the elder\nGrossman [E26]. Einstein's funds may have been limited,\nhis marriage may not have been perfect.\nAn Addendum on Einstein Biographies\nIn preparing this chapter, I have striven to rely as much as possible on original\ndocuments.

Both effects had been calculated by Einstein in 1915.\nThis issue of Nature appeared at a time when Einstein was already recognized\nas a world figure, not only by the physics community but by the public at large.\nIts opening article is by Einstein and begins, 'There is something attractive in\npresenting the evolution of a sequence of ideas in as brief a form as possible . There follow papers by Dyson and Crommelin, the astronomers, by Jeans,\nLorentz, Lodge, and Eddington, the physicists, and by Hermann Weyl, the math-\nematician. In that same month, Einstein had been approached for a contribution to\nNature [L2].7\n178 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\noriginal manuscript is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City\nand in what follows is referred to as the Morgan manuscript. At one point he explains how in 1907 the\npreparation of a review article led him to ask in what way the Newtonian theory\nof gravitation would have to be modified in order that its laws would fit special\nrelativity. 'When, in 1907,1 was working on a comprehensive paper on the special\ntheory of relativity for the Jahrbuch der Radioaktivitdt und Elektronik, I had also\nto attempt to modify the Newtonian theory of gravitation in such a way that its\nlaws would fit in the [special relativity] theory.\nLet us now turn to Section V of Einstein's 1907 review article [E3], received\nby the editor on December 4 of that year. It is here that he begins the long road\nfrom the special theory to the general theory of relativity.\n*At this point, the original text contains a few words which Einstein clearly had forgotten to delete.\nTHE HAPPIEST THOUGHT OF MY LIFE' 179\nI mentioned in Chapter 7 the contributions Einstein made to special relativity\nafter the completion of his September 1905 paper on that subject.\nHis first important paper on relativity theory after 1905 is the 1907 review. On\nSeptember 25, 1907, Einstein had accepted this invitation [E4]. On November 1,\nEinstein further wrote to Stark: 'I am now ready with the first part of the work\nfor your Jahrbuch; I am working zealously on the second [part] in my unfortu-\nnately scarce spare time' [E5]. Since this second part contains the remarks on\ngravitation, it seems most probable that Einstein's 'happiest thought' came to him\nsometime in November 1907. It impelled\nme toward a theory of gravitation. [II]\nWas Einstein first drawn to gravitation because he wanted to include it in spe-\ncial relativity or because he saw that he could extend special relativity with its\nhelp. That is also Einstein's own recollection, again found in\nthe Kyoto lecture: 'In 1907, while I was writing a review of the consequences of\nspecial relativity . The absence\nof the equation for the static Newtonian gravitational potential $:\n(where p is the matter density and G the Newtonian gravitational constant) in the\n1907 review indicates that the generalization of this equation to special relativity\nwas not his ultimate purpose.' That is Ein-\nl8o RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nstein's starting question, 'which must occur to everyone who has followed the\napplications of the relativity principle.' Einstein noted that his\nreview was not the place for a thorough discussion of the questions which now\narose.]\nEinstein at once turned to the physics of Eq. This assump-\ntion was of cardinal importance for Einstein's further thinking.\nIndomitably Einstein goes on. Again he compares the\nI own two mementos of Einstein, which I cherish.\nThis review does not have the perfection of the 1905 paper on special relativity. Einstein was the first to realize this, in 1915. On\nDecember 24, Einstein wrote to Conrad Habicht:\nAt this time I am [again] busy with considerations on relativity theory in con-\nnection with the law of gravitation. contributes to the total energy an additional\nposition dependent amount\n'THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT OF MY LIFE' 183\nthis article at least as much as the perfect relativity paper of 1905, not so much\nfor its details as for its courage.\nEinstein's treatment of simultaneity in 1905 was the result of many years of\nthinking that had led him to a new physical interpretation of global Lorentz\ninvariance.

For whatever reason, Einstein had omitted to follow the require-\nment to send along with his application a Habilitationsschrift, a not hitherto pub-\nlished scientific article. Accordingly, the request was denied until such time as\nHerr Einstein saw fit to produce such a document [Fl]. Einstein procrastinated. At any rate, early in 1908 he finally produced his\nHabilitationsschrift and on February 28 a letter was drawn up informing young\nDoctor Einstein that his application had been accepted and that he had been\ngranted the venia docendi, the right to teach [F2].

It was there that on December 21,\n1908, the next main academic event in the Einstein family took place.\nThe topic of Einstein's second course, the theory of radiation, was also the sub-\nject of his Habilitationsschrift: 'Consequences for the Constitution of Radiation of\nthe Energy Distribution Law of Blackbody Radiation' [F3]. Suffice it\nto say here that they are Einstein's most important contributions in the period\nfrom 1908 to 1911.\nMeanwhile Einstein had obtained his first faculty post, associate professor of the-\noretical physics at the University of Zurich. There\nhad been no professor of theoretical or mathematical physics since Clausius had\nleft the university in 1867 [Rl]. The proposal to the faculty written by Alfred\nKleiner clearly shows Einstein's rapidly growing renown: 'Today Einstein ranks\namong the most important theoretical physicists and has been recognized rather\ngenerally as such since his work on the relativity principle .\nEinstein must have been aware of this appreciation. Perhaps, also, he may have\nsensed some of the following sentiments expressed in a part of the final faculty\nreport*: 'These expressions of our colleague Kleiner, based on several years of\npersonal contact, were all the more valuable for the committee as well as for the\nfaculty as a whole since Herr Dr Einstein is an Israelite and since precisely to the\nIsraelites among scholars are ascribed (in numerous cases not entirely without\ncause) all kinds of unpleasant peculiarities of character, such as intrusiveness,\nimpudence, and a shopkeeper's mentality** in the perception of their academic\nposition.'\nl86 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\ntherefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to be a Jew.\" Therefore neither the com-\nmittee nor the faculty as a whole considered it compatible with its dignity to adopt\nanti-Semitism as a matter of policyf and the information which Herr Kollege\nKleiner was able to provide about the character of Herr Dr Einstein has com-\npletely reassured us' [SIa].\nThe secret faculty vote of March 1909 on the Einstein appointment was ten in\nfavor, one abstention. On July 6, 1909, Einstein submitted his resignation to the\npatent office. That same month the new asso-\nciate professor and doctor honoris causa attended, at age thirty, his first physics\nconference, at Salzburg. On December 11, 1909, he gave, for the first but not the last time in his\nlife, an inaugural address, this one entitled 'On the Role of Atomic Theory in the\nNew Physics.\nNew reponsibilities awaited him: six to eight hours of teaching and seminars\nper week, students to be taken care of, among them Hans Tanner, his first PhD\nstudent, who did not get his degree with Einstein, however. In his later years, Einstein used to say that he did not enjoy\nteaching.\nIn his Zurich period, from October 1909 to March 1911, Einstein published\neleven papers on theoretical physics, including the one on critical opalescence. Another\nstudent, Hermann Schuepp, was given a PhD thesis topic by Herzog before Einstein arrived at\nZurich. Einstein acted as the referee for this thesis, which was accepted by the faculty on December\n21, 1909 [Dl]. Einstein's fellow Olympia member, Konrad Habicht, and the latter's brother\nPaul became interested. Einstein' [HI]. Einstein followed the further development with\nlively interest [E6].)\nEinstein and his family moved to Prague in March 1911. Three and a Half Years of SUence\nEinstein first stated the equivalence principle in 1907. In 1915 he presented the\ngeneral theory of relativity as we now know it. This much I learned long ago from\nPauli's encyclopedia article, and also that Einstein arrived at his final version\n'nach langen Irrwegen,' after having followed wrong tracks for a long time [P2].\nI therefore imagined an Einstein engrossed in his new ideas of 1907 and laboring\nunremittingly from 1907 until 1915 to incorporate into a full-fledged theory the\ngeneralization from invariance under uniform motion to invariance under general\nmotion.\nEinstein remained silent on gravitation from December 1907 until June 1911,\na few months after he had settled in Prague. It was also a period\nin which Einstein experienced a rapid rise to fame and in which he established\n\"Helen Dukas tells me that Einstein recognized rather early signs of dementia praecox in his\nyounger son.\nl88 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nhis first contacts with larger segments of the physics community. Yet, I think, all this has little if anything to do with Einstein's\nsilence on gravitation. There were the papers with\nLaub on special relativity, the papers with Hopf on classical radiation theory, and\nthe difficult paper on critical opalescence.\nThere is, of course, nothing unusual about the fact that Einstein did not publish\nanything new about gravitation between 1908 and 1911.\nMore curious is the fact that he twice gave surveys of relativity theory without\nmentioning gravitation or the equivalence principle and its remarkable implica-\ntions: the red shift and the bending of light. The first of these surveys was his\nreport at the Salzburg conference, which included a survey of relativity theory, 'of\nthe consequences of which I would like to mention only a single one' [E3] (namely,\nE = me2), but quantum theory rather than relativity theory was the main issue. Throughout his career Einstein was accustomed to writing to one\nor more colleagues or friends about scientific problems which at any given time\nwere important to him. It would\nnot in the least have been out of style for Einstein to write to one of his friends:\nI am preoccupied with the gravitation problem, it mystifies me and I am not get-\nting anywhere.\nSome examples may show the intensity of Einstein's concern with quantum\nphysics during that period.

To Besso,\nNovember 1909: 'Reflected little and unsuccessfully about light-quanta' [Ell].\nIn the summer of 1910 Einstein wrote to Laub about his long review article\n[E8]: '[This paper] contains only a rather broad expose of the epistemological\nfoundations of the relativity theory' [El5]. This would have been as good an\noccasion as any to reflect on the new epistemology of the equivalence principle,\nbut Einstein does not do so.\nOne month later, in June 1911, he was back to gravitation theory. my paper [of 1907].

Our\nnext subject will be two profound papers on radiation published in 1909. The first\none [E2] was completed while Einstein was still a technical expert second class at\nthe patent office. Never-\ntheless, 'one cannot think of refusing [to accept] Planck's theory,' Einstein said in\nhis talk at Salzburg. As is so typical for\nEinstein, he derived this statistical physics equation in a paper devoted to the\nquantum theory, the January 1909 paper.5, Einstein stressed that 'the current theory of radia-\ntion is incompatible with this result.5, Einstein had this to say: 'If it alone were present, it would\nresult in fluctuations [to be expected] if radiation were to consist of independently\nmoving pointlike quanta with energy hi>.\nObserve the appearance of a new element in this last statement by Einstein.4 do not explicitly occur in Einstein's own paper. This is one of the arguments which led Einstein in\n1909 to summarize his view on the status of the radiation theory in the following\nway.\nThe extraordinary significance for twentieth century physics of Einstein's sum-\nming up hardly needs to be stressed. I also see it as highly meaningful in relation\nto the destiny of Einstein the scientist if not of Einstein the man. In 1909, at age\nthirty, he was prepared for a fusion theory. Yet when the\nfusion theory arrived in 1925, in the form of quantum mechanics, Einstein could\nnot accept the duality of particles and waves inherent in that theory as being fun-\ndamental and irrevocable. It may have distressed him that one statement he made\nin 1909 needed revision: moving light-quanta with energy hv are not pointlike.\nLater on, I shall have to make a number of comments on the scientific reasons\nthat changed Einstein's apartness from that of a figure far ahead of his time to\nthat of a figure on the sidelines.\n(As a postscript to the present section, I add a brief remark on Einstein's energy\nfluctuation formula. Einstein himself\nhad given qualitative arguments for the case of Eq. The source of the trouble seemed to lie in Einstein's entropy\nadditivity assumption (see Eq. In that same paper, it was shown, however, that the\nnew quantum mechanics applied to a set of noninteracting oscillators does give the\nEinstein answer. Spontaneous and Induced Radiative Transitions\nAfter 1909 Einstein continued brooding about the light-quantum for almost\nanother two years.\nIn October 1911 Einstein (now a professor in Prague) gave a report on the quan-\ntum theory to the first Solvay Congress [E7], but by this time general relativity\nhad already become his main concern and would remain so until November 1915.)\nEinstein considered a system consisting of a gas of his molecules interacting\nwith electromagnetic radiation.) Einstein\nremarked that 'the constants A and B could be computed directly if we were to\npossess an electrodynamics and mechanics modified in the sense of the quantum\nhypothesis' [E9].\nTwo of the three papers under discussion [E10, Ell] contained another result,\none which Einstein himself considered far more important than his derivation of\nthe radiation law: light-quanta carry a momentum hv/c. Its subject was 'electrons et\nphotons. It was via the analysis of statistical fluctuations of blackbody radiation\nthat Einstein eventually came to associate a definite momentum with a light-quan-\ntum. Before I describe what he did, I should again draw\nthe attention of the reader to the remarkable fact that it took the father of special\nrelativity theory twelve years to write down the relation p = hv/c side by side\nwith E = hv. Momentum Fluctuations: 1909. Einstein's first results bearing on the\nquestion of photon momentum are found in the two 1909 papers. Recall that Einstein had said of the first term in Eq.17 would lead Einstein to\nstate, in 1909, the 'momentum quantum postulate': monochromatic radiation of\nlow density behaves in regard to pressure fluctuations as if it consists of mutually\nindependent momentum quanta of magnitude hv/' c. It is unthinkable to me that\nEinstein did not think so.\nThe photon momentum made its explicit appearance in that same year, 1909.\nJohannes Stark had attended the Salzburg meeting at which Einstein discussed\nthe radiative fluctuations. Einstein himself did not explicitly intro-\nduce photon momentum until 1916, in the course of his studies on thermal equi-\nlibrium between electromagnetic radiation and a molecular gas [E10, Ell]. In\naddition to his new discussion of Planck's law, Einstein raised the following prob-\nlem. Einstein began the discussion of this question in the same way he\nhad treated the mirror problem in 1909.8,\nEinstein could compute separately expressions for (A2) as well as for P in terms\nof the A and B terms and p, where p is now given by Planck's law.) Thus Einstein found that consistency with the Planck distribution (and\nEqs. And so with the help of his trusted and beloved fluctuation\nmethods, Einstein once again produced a major insight, the association of momen-\ntum quanta with energy quanta. Earliest Unbehagen about Chance\nEinstein prefaced his statement about photon momentum just quoted with the\nremark that this conclusion can be considered 'als ziemlich sicher erwiesen,' as\nfairly certainly proven. Nevertheless, his 1917 results led Einstein to drop his caution\nand reticence about light-quanta. In a letter to\n*In 1910, Einstein had made a related calculation, together with Hopf [E12].\nOn the other hand, at about the same time that Einstein lost any remaining\ndoubts about the existence of light-quanta, we also encounter the first expressions\nof his Unbehagen, his discomfort with the theoretical implications of the new\nquantum concepts in regard to 'Zufall,' chance. This earliest unease stemmed\nfrom the conclusion concerning spontaneous emission that Einstein had been\nforced to draw from his consistency condition (Eq. Einstein himself drew attention to this simi-\nlarity: 'It speaks in favor of the theory that the statistical law assumed for [spon-\ntaneous] emission is nothing but the Rutherford law of radioactive decay' [E9]. I should now add that Einstein was the first to realize that the\nprobability for spontaneous emission is a nonclassical quantity. No one before\nEinstein in 1917 saw as clearly the depth of the conceptual crisis generated by the\noccurrence of spontaneous processes with a well-defined lifetime. [Ell]\nImmediately following his comment on chance, Einstein continued, 'Neverthe-\nless, I have full confidence in the route which has been taken' [Ell]. It is believed by nearly all of us that the joke was under-\nstood soon after 1925, when it became possible to calculate Einstein's Amn and\nfimn from first principles. An Aside: Quantum Conditions for Nonseparable Classical Motion\nIn May 1917, shortly after Einstein finished his triple of papers on the quantum\ntheory of radiation, he wrote an article on the restrictions imposed by the 'old'\nquantum theory on classically allowed orbits in phase space [El7], to which he\nadded a brief mathematical sequel a few months later [E18]. The only\nlogic for mentioning this work at this particular place is that it fits with the time\nsequence of Einstein's contributions to quantum physics. In particular, it is not\nclear to me why Einstein himself did not consider these relations. Compton in his paper does not mention\nEinstein at all. Compton found this relation to be satisfied\n* Einstein attached great importance to an advance in another direction that took place in the inter-\nvening years: the effect discovered by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach [E21].'**\nThis discovery 'created a sensation among the physicists of that time' [Al].\nWhat about Einstein's response.'\nStill, Einstein was not (and would never be) satisfied.'\nThe years 1923-24 mark the end of the first phase of Einstein's apartness in\nrelation to the quantum theory.\n**The work of Compton and Debye led Pauli to extend Einstein's work of 1917 to the case of\nradiation in equilibrium with free electrons [P3].

Einstein first reminds the reader of the\nequivalence of Newton's mechanical laws in both frames. Thus in 1911 we discern the first glimpses of the new Einstein\nprogram: to derive the equivalence principle from a new theory of gravitation.

In that turbulent year,\nLenard, in one of his attempts to discredit Einstein, reproduced part of Soldner's\npaper in the Annalen der Physik [L2], together with a lengthy introduction in\nwhich he also claimed priority for Hasenohrl in connection with the mass-energy\nequivalence.

In 1907 and 1911 Einstein had stretched the kine-\nmatic approach to gravitation to its limits.

From Prague to Zurich\nGrossmann appeared in previous chapters as the helpful fellow student who made\nhis course notes available to Einstein, as the helpful friend who together with his\nfather paved the way for Einstein's appointment at the patent office in Bern, and\nas the friend to whom Einstein dedicated his doctoral thesis. Thereupon he studied at the ETH\nfrom 1896 to 1900, together with Einstein. The mentioned papers are his entire sci-\nentific output prior to the collaboration with Einstein, which began a few months\nafter the Cambridge conference.\nOne of the first acts of the uncommonly young dean was to sound out Einstein\n208\nannTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 209\nas to whether he might be interested in returning to Zurich, this time to the ETH.\nGrossmann's letter is lost but not Einstein's reply: 'I am certainly prepared in\nprinciple to accept a teaching position at your [ETH]. Einstein was now in great demand. Einstein also wrote to Zangger of an offer (which he declined) to lecture at\nColumbia University in New York in the fall of 1912 [E4]. The authorities quickly accepted the pro-\nposal, and on February 2 Einstein could write to Alfred Stern, 'Two days ago I\nreceived the call from the [ETH] (halleluia. And so, in the fall of 1912, Einstein began the next\nphase of his academic career. 'I declined to take anything into consideration until I had settled in Zurich,'\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, whom he had informed of the Berlin and Vienna over-\ntures [E6].\nThere was one man who at that time came close to changing Einstein's mind\nand perhaps his destiny: Lorentz. During the Solvay conference in October 1911,\nLorentz asked Einstein what the prospects were of his coming to Utrecht [LI]. Lorentz replied\n*k.\n210 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat Einstein should accept his post in Zurich cheerfully and in good spirits [LI]. On February 29, 1912,\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, 'I was called to Leiden by Lorentz to be his successor. Some time in 1913 Einstein sent Ehrenfest a letter which must often have\ngiven its recipient food for thought: 'When Lorentz called me at that time I expe-\nrienced an undeniable shudder' [E9]. From scalar to tensor\nIn August 1912, Einstein and his family arrived back in Zurich. Some time between August 10 and August 16, it became clear to\nEinstein that Riemannian geometry is the correct mathematical tool for what we\nnow call general relativity theory.\nIn order to appreciate what happened in August 1912, it is essential to know\nthat before his arrival in Zurich Einstein had already concluded that the descrip-\ntion of gravitation in terms of the single scalar c-field of the Prague days had to\ngo and that a new geometry of physical space-time was needed. This opinion is based on some remarks in Einstein's\npapers; on a study of all the letters from the period March-August 16, 1912,\nwhich are in the Einstein archives in Princeton; and on recollections by myself\nand by Ernst Gabor Straus, Einstein's assistant from 1944 to 1948, of conversa-\ntions with Einstein. Toward the end of that month,\nEinstein wrote to Besso, 'Recently, I have been working furiously on the gravi-\ntation problem. This undated letter was\ncertainly written in 1912 and most probably before the middle of May, since by\nthat time, Einstein had become less assured.\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 211\nuntil now I have been unable to penetrate beyond the statics of gravitation' [El 3].\nThere is a brief and cryptic statement in the last paper Einstein wrote in\nPrague, in July, which indicates that he was onto something new. I do not know how often such a symbol is found\nin Einstein's writings, but I do know that it occurs only rarely.\nOn August 10, as said, Einstein registered as a Zurich resident.\nTwo statements by Einstein tell the story.' One Einstein biographer wrote general for most general [S4], a nontrivial modification\nof this crucial phrase.\n212 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nat that time that Riemann had studied the foundations of geometry in an even\nmore profound way.\nRegarding the role of Carl Friedrich Geiser,* it is known that Einstein attended\nat least some of Geiser's lectures [K2].\nI believe that this first encounter with differential geometry played a secondary\nrole in Einstein's thinking in 1912. During long conversations with Einstein in\nPrague, the mathematician Georg Pick expressed the conjecture that the needed\nmathematical instruments for the further development of Einstein's ideas might\nbe found in the papers by Ricci and Levi-Civita [Fl]. I doubt that this remark\nmade any impression on Einstein at that time.\nEinstein's second statement on the July-August period was made in 1923: 'I\nhad the decisive idea of the analogy between the mathematical problem of the\ntheory [of general relativity] and the Gaussian theory of surfaces only in 1912,\nhowever, after my return to Zurich, without being aware at that time of the work\nof Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.\nWe learn from these two statements that even during his last weeks in Prague\nEinstein already knew that he needed the theory of invariants and covariants\nassociated with the differential line element\n'Geiser was a competent and influential mathematician who did much to raise the level of the math-\nematics faculty at the ETH [Kl]. With Grossmann's help,\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 213\nthe great transition to Riemannian geometry must have taken place during the\nweek prior to August 16, as is indicated by Einstein's letter to Hopf.\nThese conclusions are in harmony with my own recollections of a discussion\nwith Einstein in which I asked him how the collaboration with Grossmann began.\nI have a vivid though not verbatim memory of Einstein's reply: he told Grossmann\nof his problems and asked him to please go to the library and see if there existed\nan appropriate geometry to handle such questions. It is found at the end\nof the introduction to Einstein's first monograph on general relativity, written in\n1916: 'Finally, grateful thoughts go at this place to my friend the mathematician\nGrossmann, who by his help not only saved me the study of the relevant mathe-\nmatical literature but also supported me in the search for the field equations of\ngravitation' [E21].\nFinally, there is a recollection which I owe to Straus [S6], who also remembers\nthat Einstein was already thinking about general covariance when he met Gross-\nmann. Einstein told Grossmann that he needed a geometry which allowed for the\nmost general transformations that leave Eq. Grossmann replied\nthat Einstein was looking for Riemannian geometry. (Straus does not recall that\nEinstein had asked Grossmann to check the literature. Einstein then\nasked if there were any other geometries he could use. Einstein replied to this last\nremark that he thought, on the contrary, that was a great advantage. [E22]\nLet us pursue Einstein's 'decisive step' a little further.* Einstein was not the greatest expert\nin following the scientific literature, but he apparently did know Born's main\npaper of 1909 on the relativistic treatment of rigid bodies [Bl]. At the Salzburg\nconference in the fall of 1909, Born's presentation of his work on the rigid body\n[B2] immediately preceded Einstein's own report on the constitution of radiation\n[E25], and it is known that the two men used that occasion for private discussions\non scientific topics of so much common concern [B3]. In June 1912 Einstein was\nbrooding over Born's earlier work, as his letter to Ehrenfest shows. For our pur-\nposes, it is of no relevance to discuss the paradoxes to which this approach gives\nrise for the case of a finite body\u2014the case to which Einstein referred in his June\n7 letter to Ehrenfest.\nI now return to Einstein.\nHowever this may be, after his first dicussions with Grossmann, Einstein had\nfound the correct starting point for general relativity. In October Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld:\nAt present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now\nbelieve that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathema-\ntician here. The collaboration\nThe Einstein-Grossmann paper (referred to here as EG), published in 1913\n[E29], contains profound physical insight into the nature of measurement, some\ncorrect general relativistic equations, some faulty reasoning, and clumsy notation. In 1914 Einstein abandoned this miserable notation. This rule was intro-\nduced in 1916\u2014by none other than Einstein himself [E31].\nIn EG, Einstein expresses his indebtedness to Mach for inspiring some of his\nideas. Comments on the influence of Mach on Einstein, an important subject in\nits own right, will be deferred till Chapter 15.\nAs we have seen, the equivalence principle in its primitive form (equality of\ngravitational and inertial mass for a material object) was Einstein's guide ever\nsince 1907.THE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 217\nEotvos experiments for the first time in EG, concluding that 'the physical identity\nof gravitational and inertial mass .\nI restrict my own task to explaining how Einstein 'grew up.

The Aftermath\nIn 1905 Einstein had dedicated his doctoral thesis to Grossmann. The brief remainder of this chapter is devoted to the tale of Ein-\nstein and Grossmann from the times following their epochal collaboration until\nshortly before Einstein's death.\n224 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nOn September 9, 1913, first Einstein then Grossmann read papers before the\nannual meeting of the Swiss Physical Society [E36, G2]. Einstein had already\nmoved to Berlin when their next and last joint paper came out [E37]. The paper originated as a reac-\ntion to what Grossmann was told by a friend about a lecture by Einstein on unified\nfield theory. Its contents were\ndiscussed in a correspondence between Einstein and Grossmann that is friendly\nyet strained. Einstein also wrote to Cartan, urging him not to answer Grossmann\npublicly [E38]; Cartan agreed [C2].*\nAfter Grossmann's death in 1936, Einstein wrote a moving and deeply respect-\nful letter to his widow [E39] about Grossmann's 'gruesome fate after early years\nrich in work and aspiration.\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 225\nI have a sense of regret that Einstein did not do something for which he had\noften demonstrated a talent and sensitivity: to write an obituary shortly after\nGrossmann's death.'

Einstein in Vienna\nIt did not take Einstein long to realize that the collaboration with Grossmann [El ]\nhad led to some conclusions that defeated the very task he had set himself. Let us\nbriefly recapitulate the developments in his thinking about gravitation up to the\nspring of 1913. Late in 1907 he discovered the singular position of gravitation in\nthe theory of relativity.\nHe expressed this in a letter to Lorentz: .\nThoughts such as these must have been on Einstein's mind when he traveled\nto Vienna, where on September 23 he had to present a paper before the Natur-\nforscherversammlung.* He was going to report not only on his own work but also\n*At that meeting, Einstein met and complimented Friedrich Kottler, who had been the first to write\nthe Maxwell equations in generally covariant form, though not in connection with a theory of grav-\nitation [Kl].\n228\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 229\non the gravitation theory which the Finnish physicist Gunnar Nordstrom had\nbeen developing since 1912. Furthermore, he was going to comment on yet another\nrecent gravitation theory, this one by Abraham (whom we encountered earlier in\nthe discussion of special relativity).* In one way\nor another, this outpouring of gravitation theories in the years 1912 and 1913 was\na consequence of Einstein's Prague papers. As a preface to the discussion of the confused situation at the\nVienna congress of 1913 let us briefly go back half a century. In 1908 Poincare mentioned\nLorentz's gravitation theory as an example of a field theory that is compatible\nwith the requirements of special relativity [PI].\nThis brief period began with Einstein's paper of June 1911, in which he\nshowed that the velocity of light cannot generally be treated as a universal constant\nin a static gravitational field [E4].3,\n* Poincare had already emphasized the need for a relativistic theory of gravitation in his memoir of\n1905 [ P2], in which he discussed some general kinematic aspects of the problem without commitment\nto a specific model.\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 231\nsince c is not a constant. Hence\nor, approximately,\nwhich is Einstein's equation of 1911 (see Eq. In a first comment [A5], Abraham noted that relativity was\nthreatening the healthy development of physics since 'it was clear to the sober\nobserver that this theory could never lead to a complete world picture if it were\nnot possible .' He added that Einstein had given 'the\ndeath blow to relativity' by discarding the unconditional validity of Lorentz invar-\niance.' Abraham acknowledged the cor-\nrectness of Einstein's technical objections to his work.\nEinstein shot right back, though in measured language: '[Special] relativity has\na wide range of applicability [and is] an important advance; I do not believe it has\nimpeded the progress of physics. He\nexpressed his own views about the difficult and as yet unsolved problem of gravity\nby making a comparison: 'In my opinion, the situation [regarding gravity] does\nnot indicate the failure of the [special] relativity principle, just as the discovery\nand correct interpretation of Brownian motion did not lead one to consider ther-\nmodynamics and hydrodynamics as heresies.' In reply, Einstein published a five-line statement in which he declared\n*Note that these comments preceded the publication of the Einstein-Grossman paper [El].\n232 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat the public debate was closed as far as he was concerned [E7].\nI would have disregarded the Abraham-Einstein polemic were it not for the\nfact that Abraham was a very good physicist. Einstein considered him to have the\nbest understanding of gravitation among his colleagues [E9]. Abraham's 1914\nreview of gravitation theories is excellent [Al]. When in 1913 Einstein decided to\nleave Zurich for Berlin, he suggested to Zangger that Abraham be considered as\nhis successor [E10]. Between himself and his visions stood\nforever the figure of his demon: Einstein. He understood relativity but could not\nfind peace with it.\nThe abstractions of Einstein were deeply repugnant to him; he loved his absolute\naether, his field equations, his rigid electron, as a youth does his first flame, whose\nmemories cannot be erased by later experiences. As I have noted repeatedly, Einstein correctly saw from the begin-\nning that the incorporation of gravity meant the end of the unconditional validity\nof special relativity.3, one finds\n*On May 17, 1912, Einstein wrote to Wien that Abraham had become a 'convert' to his theory.\nI shall not follow his derivations, however, but instead describe the simple trick,\nreported by Einstein at the Vienna meeting [Ell], which leads rapidly to the\ndesired result.\nAbout one quarter of Einstein's Vienna report, 'On the Current Status of the\nGravitation Problem,' is devoted to Nordstrom's work.f He commented only\nbriefly on Abraham's contributions, noting that he considered it a requirement of\nany future theory that special relativity be incorporated and that Abraham had\nnot done so. When in the subsequent discussion Mie remarked that Nordstrom's\ntheory was an outgrowth of Abraham's work, Einstein replied: psychologically\nyes, logically no.\n-(-Einstein also used this occasion to withdraw an objection to the scalar theory which he had raised\nin his paper with Grossmann [El].\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 235\nderatum stressed by Einstein.' When Mie asked afterward why Einstein had not mentioned his,\nMie's, work, Einstein replied that he would discuss only theories which, unlike\nMie's, satisfy the equivalence principle.* The bulk of Einstein's report was of\ncourse devoted to his recent work with Grossmann. At Vienna, Mie was Einstein's principal antagonist.\nShortly after this meeting, Mie wrote a further critique on Einstein's theory [M4],\nto which Einstein replied by giving arguments that were in part incorrect: once\nagain he stressed the inevitability of the invariance of the gravitational equations\nfor linear transformations only [El 3].\nIn summary, prior to 1912 no attempt to construct a field theory of gravitation\nhad led anywhere. Toward the end of 1913 the situation was thoroughly con-\nfused. Most physicists\nwere ready to accept special relativity.\nThere is no evidence that anyone shared Einstein's views concerning the limita-\ntions imposed by gravitation on special relativity, nor that anyone was ready to\nfollow his program for a tensor theory of gravitation.-\nGrossmann] with favor,' Einstein wrote in the same letter in which he had\nexpressed his own doubts about the status of his theory [E3].\nfSee Chapter 14 for comments by Einstein in 1914 on the Nordstrom theory and [E17] for his\nreminiscences on scalar theories.\n236 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe portrait of Einstein the scientist in 1913 is altogether remarkable.\nIt seems to me that Einstein's intellectual strength, courage, and tenacity to con-\ntinue under such circumstances and then to be supremely vindicated a few years\nlater do much to explain how during his later years he would fearlessly occupy\nonce again a similar position, in his solitary quest for an interpretation of quantum\nmechanics which was totally at variance with commonly held views. The Einstein-Fokker Paper\nAdriaan Daniel Fokker received his PhD degree late in 1913 under Lorentz. It led to one brief paper\nwhich is of considerable interest for the history of general relativity because it\ncontains Einstein's first treatment of a gravitation theory in which general covar-\niance is strictly obeyed [El8].\nThus, early in 1914, just fifty years after Maxwell's first attempt at a gravita-\ntion field theory, Einstein was not yet quite there but he was closing in, as the\nfinal remark of the Einstein-Fokker paper clearly indicates.

'Planck had asked him what he was working on,\nand Einstein described general relativity as it was then.\nEinstein reacted rapidly and positively to the approach from Berlin.\n239\n240 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe ETH shows that he had acted as Korreferent* for four theses, all in experi-\nmental physics, but had not taken on PhD students in theoretical physics.\nEncouraged by Einstein's response, Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg\njoined in signing a formal laudatio, the statement supporting a proposal for mem-\nbership, which was presented to the academy on June 12, 1913 [Kl]. A number of arrangements remained to be worked out,\nbut already in July 1913 Einstein wrote to a friend that he was going to be in\nBerlin by the spring of 1914 [E2].\nIn a letter [K3] sent to the academy on December 7, 1913, Einstein formally\naccepted membership and declared that he wished to begin his new position in\nApril 1914. On February 9, 1914, he gave a farewell talk before the Physical\nSociety of Zurich, in which he noted that 'we have progressed as little in the theory\nof gravitation as the physicists of the eighteenth century when they knew only\nCoulomb's law' [E6]. He mentioned the Nordstrom and the Einstein-Grossmann\ntheories, remarked that the former is simpler and more plausible but does not shed\nany light on the relativity of nonuniform motion, and expressed the hope that the\nbending of light (present in the Einstein-Grossmann theory, absent in the Nord-\nstrom theory) would soon lead to an experimental choice between these two\npossibilities.\nThe Einsteins left Zurich in late March 1914. Soon after Mileva's arrival, the Einsteins separated. Einstein never put all the blame for\nthat on Mileva. Einstein saw them off at the station. In later\ntimes, after Einstein's remarriage, the sons would visit and stay with their father\nin Berlin.\nSoon after the separation, Einstein moved into a bachelor apartment at Wit-\ntelsbacherstrasse 13.\nBy the time Einstein arrived in Berlin, he was already a man of great renown,\nthough not yet the stellar figure he was to become five years later. Einstein accepted. On April 26,\n1914, his first newspaper article appeared, entitled 'Vom Relativitatsprinzip,'\nAbout the relativity principle [E10].' Einstein remarked that the\nsecond alternative appeared to him to be the correct one but added that 'on this\npoint, the views even of those physicists who understand relativity theory are still\ndivided.'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].' Then he went on to relativity\ntheory and observed that the special theory 'is not fully satisfactory from the the-\noretical point of view because it gives a preferred position to uniform motion.'\nPlanck replied [PI], welcoming Einstein and remarking, 'I know you well\nenough to dare say that your real love belongs to that direction of work in which\n*' .'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article.\n242 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe personality can unfold itself in the freest possible way. 'In my opin-\nion, one could just as well take the opposite view [of Einstein's] and look upon the\npreferred position of uniform motion as precisely a very important and valuable\ncharacteristic of the theory'.' Planck ended by expressing the hope that the expedition planned to\nobserve the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, would provide information about the\nbending of light predicted (not yet correctly) by Einstein.\nEinstein's productivity was not affected by the deep troubles of the war years,\nwhich, in fact, rank among the most productive and creative in his career. During\nthis period, he completed the general theory of relativity, found the correct values\nfor the bending of light and the displacement of the perihelion of Mercury, did\npioneering work on cosmology and on gravitational waves, introduced his A and\nB coefficients for radiative transitions, found a new derivation of Planck's radia-\ntion law\u2014and ran into his first troubles with causality in quantum physics.\nThis intense scientific activity did not banish from Einstein's mind a genuine\nand intense concern for the tragic events unfolding in the world around him. On\nthe contrary, the period of 1914-18 marks the public emergence of Einstein the\nradical pacifist, the man of strong moral convictions who would never shy away\nfrom expressing his opinions publicly, whether they were popular or not. This appears to be the first political\ndocument to which Einstein lent his name.* It gave him joy to find colleagues\nwho 'stand above the situation and do not let themselves be driven by the murky\n* Einstein on Peace by Otto Nathan and Heinz Norden describes in detail Einstein's political activ-\nities during the First World War [Nl].\nEinstein's initial hopes that the voices of reason might prevail yielded to increas-\ning pessimism as the war dragged on. These feelings of dejection may have been enhanced, I think, by\nEinstein's own illness at that time.\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity. We are in the fall of 1914, at which time Einstein wrote a long\npaper for the proceedings of the Prussian Academy [El6]. First of all, Einstein takes a stand against Newton's argument for the\nabsolute character of rotation (as demonstrated, for example, by Newton's often\nreproduced discussion of the rotating bucket filled with water [Wl]).\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. Now, late in 1914, Einstein reproduced this same argument in his\nlong paper. In 1914 not only did he have some wrong physical ideas\nabout causality but in addition he did not yet understand some elementary math-\nematical notions about tensors [HI]. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. Einstein was grateful for hav-\ning these brought to his attention. 'It is remarkable\nhow little my colleagues are susceptible to the inner need for a real relativity the-\nory.\nIn summary, toward the end of 1914 Einstein could look back on a year which\nhad brought major changes to his personal life and his professional career. He\nwas still essentially alone in his convictions about the future of relativity theory\nand confused about some of its crucial features.\n\"The slight extension of the set of allowed transformations given in the second Einstein-Grossmann\npaper [E23] (Section 12d) must have been found shortly afterward. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. It would be fulfilled before the year was out, but not until Einstein\nhad passed through a crisis followed by an exhausting struggle.\nMeanwhile, early in 1915 he did not publish anything substantially new on\nrelativity.** He did write two review articles, one on relativity theory [Ell] and\none on the atomic theory of matter [E29], and a short paper on the statistical\nproperties of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium [E30]. At that time Einstein made good\nuse of a temporary guest appointment at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsan-\nstalt in Charlottenburg [K4].\nWander Johannes de Haas was a Dutch physicist of Einstein's age.f In\nAugust 1913, when Lorentz sent congratulations to Einstein on his forthcoming\nappointment in Berlin, he must have added (the letter is lost) a query concerning\nde Haas, as is seen from Einstein's reply: 'At present, I do not know what to do\nin the matter of your son-in-law, since in Berlin I will have neither an institute\nnor an assistant.\nEinstein was now in a position to do something for de Haas\u2014and for Lorentz.^\nI do not know when de Haas joined Einstein at the Reichsanstalt.\nSoon after the conclusion of their collaboration, Einstein wrote enthusiastically\nabout the results obtained.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5].\nHOn one occasion, Einstein referred in print to de Haas as Herr de Haas-Lorentz [E32]. Einstein could not know that his theoretical\nprediction was wrong by a factor of about 2.\nCharacteristically, Einstein was unaware of earlier efforts to measure gyro-\nmagnetic effects until some time after his own work had been completed [E33].\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned.ff The\ntheoretical derivation by Einstein in 1915 had already been given in 1907 by\nOwen Willans Richardson, who had also tried in vain to observe the rotation by\nmagnetization, at Palmer Laboratory in Princeton [R1J-H In 1909 Samuel Jack-\nson Barnett, then at Tulane University, began the study of the inverse effect, mag-\nnetization by rotation, now known as the Barnett effect.\n1[For some years after 1915, the effect was called the Einstein-Richardson effect.\nIn the model of Richardson and Einstein, the value\nwas obtained by the following reasoning. Clearly the proof that\npermanently circulating electrons indeed exist meant far more to Einstein than\nonly the verification of a century-old hypothesis. Later in 1915\nhe wrote, 'As pointed out by Einstein and de Haas, [their] experiments indicate\nvery strongly that electrons can rotate in atoms without emission of energy radia-\ntion' [B3].*\nEinstein and de Haas took two sets of measurements. I am not aware of a similar confession by Einstein.\nLet us now return to our main topic, Einstein's final formulation of his theory\nof general relativity.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. All\nthese statements taken together convince me that Einstein still believed in the 'old'\ntheory as late as July 1915, that between July and October he found objections\nto that theory, and that his final version was conceived and worked out between\nlate October and November 25. 'That fellow Einstein suits his convenience\n(Es ist bequem mil dem E.\nWhat made Einstein change his mind between July and October. Einstein got rid of all these shortcomings\nin a series of four brief articles. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44].' (It should be said that in matters of science a heavy heart never lasted\nvery long for Einstein.)\nFor the last time, I recall that Einstein and Grossmann had concluded [El7]\nthat the gravitational equations could be invariant under linear transformations\nonly and that Einstein's justification for this restriction was based on the belief\nthat the gravitational equations ought to determine the g^ uniquely, a point he\ncontinued to stress in October 1914 [E16].'\nThe remaining flaw was, of course, Einstein's unnecessary restriction to uni-\nmodular transformations.\u2022\u201e\u201e, $\u201e\u201e correspond to Einstein's G^, Rf,, Sf, in [E44].\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations. Einstein's proof of this last statement is by far the most important\npart of this paper.\nThe phrase italicized in the above quotation shows that Einstein's understand-\ning of general covariance had vastly improved. Einstein did not say all this explic-\nitly in his paper.'\nDuring the next two weeks, Einstein believed that his new equation (Eq. Einstein still subscribes to the demands of\nunimodular invariance and \\/g = 1 \u2022 On the basis of this 'most radical relativity\ntheory,' he presents two of his greatest discoveries [E48].' This discovery was, I believe, by far the strongest emo-\ntional experience in Einstein's scientific life, perhaps in all his life.\nEinstein's discovery resolved a difficulty that was known for more than sixty\nyears. The experimental number quoted\nby Einsteintf on November 18, 1915, was 45\" \u00b1 5 [E48].5H\nAgainst this background, Einstein's joy in being able to give an explanation\n'without any special hypothesis' becomes all the more understandable.\na) Einstein started from his field equations\nr^ = 0 (14. Either way, the answers for the effect are, of course, the same, a fact\nEinstein became aware of in the course of preparing his paper [E50]. Einstein asked for a static isotropic solution\nof the metric (as it is now called [W5]). And so, one\nweek before the general theory of relativity was complete, Einstein obtained for\nthe precession per revolution: 247T3a2/7\"V(l \u2014 e2), which yields 43\"/century (a\n= semimajor axis, T = period of revolution, e = eccentricity; see [W6] for the\nrelation between this result and modern experiment).\nd) Two months later, on January 16, 1916, Einstein read a paper [S4] before\nthe Prussian Academy on behalf of Karl Schwarzschild, who was in the German\narmy at the Russian front at that time. On February 24, 1916,\nEinstein read another paper by Schwarzschild [S5], this one giving the solution\nfor a mass point in the gravitational field of an incompressible fluid sphere. On June 29,\n1916, Einstein addressed the Prussian Academy [E51] to commemorate\nSchwarzschild, who had died on May 11 after a short illness contracted at the\nRussian front. Einstein devoted only half a page to his\nsecond discovery: the bending of light is twice as large as he had found earlier.\nIn Section 12d, I mentioned that Einstein did not know the Bianchi identities\n[W8]\nwhen he did his work with Grossmann.\nEinstein's brief belief in Eq.9 arose because in the November 4 paper Einstein had redefined his\n*Einstein inserted those gf, into gf,dx\"dx' = 0 and then applied Huyghens\" principle.3) in such a way that the conservation laws read\nOn November 28, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld that three years earlier he and\nGrossmann had considered Eq.*\nOn June 20, 1933, Einstein, exiled from Germany, gave a lecture at the Uni-\nversity of Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of relativity. Einstein and Hilbert**\nTo repeat, on November 25 Einstein presented his final version (Eq. Einstein, having\nlearned the hard way from his mistakes a few weeks earlier, left the structure of\nT1\" entirely free, except for its transformation and conservation properties. I believe that [my paper] contains simultaneously the solution\nof the problems of Einstein and of Mie. It was\nmeant to be a theory of everything but gravitation. For a comment by Einstein on Mie's\nelectromagnetic theory, see [E52b]. In December 1915, Einstein remarked that Hilbert's com-\nmitment to Mie's theory was unnecessary from the point of view of general rela-\ntivity [E53]. So had Einstein, a few weeks earlier [E44]. In this observation I see the simple and\nvery surprising solution of the problem of Riemann, who was the first to seek\ntheoretically for the connection between gravitation and light. By 1924 Lorentz [L4], Felix Klein [K7], Einstein [E55],\nand Weyl [Wll] had also written about the variational methods and the identities\nto which they give rise (see further Section 15c).\nI must return to Einstein and Hilbert, however.* The subject was general relativity. From\nthe period in which Einstein lectured, it is clear that his subject was the imperfect\ntheory described in his paper of October 1914. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915. However, we have Felix Klein's word that, as with Einstein,\nHilbert's decisive thoughts came to him also in the fall of 1915\u2014not in Goettingen\nbut on the island of Rugen in the Baltic [K8].\nThe most revealing source about the crucial month of November is the corre-\nspondence during that period between Einstein and Hilbert. Between November\n7 and 25, Einstein, otherwise a prolific letter writer, did not correspond with any-\none\u2014except Hilbert (if the Einstein archive in Princeton is complete in regard to\nthat period). The whole November correspondence may well have been triggered, it\nseems to me, by Einstein's knowledge that he was not the only one to have found\nflaws in this earlier work of his.\n*Einstein and Hilbert began corresponding at least as early as October 1912, when Einstein was\nstill in Zurich.\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E. Apparently Einstein has received a copy of Hilbert's\nwork.\nLet us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. It is true that Hilbert's paper contains the trace term which Einstein\nhad yet to introduce.* But Einstein's method for doing so was, as mentioned ear-\nlier, the adaptation of a trick he had already used in his paper of November 4.\nThus it seems that one should not attach much significance either to Einstein's\nagreeing with Hilbert 'as far as I can see' or to Hilbert's agreeing with Einstein\n'as it seems to me' [H4]. (I leave aside the characterization of Einstein as a mathema-\ntician, which he never was nor pretended to be. I do believe that Einstein was the sole creator of the\nphysical theory of general relativity and that both he and Hilbert should be cred-\nited for the discovery of the fundamental equation (Eq.\nSomething happened between these two men between November 20 and\nDecember 20, when Einstein wrote to Hilbert, 'There has been a certain pique\nbetween us, the causes of which I do not wish to analyze. Straus wrote to me,\n'Einstein felt that Hilbert had, perhaps unwittingly, plagiarized Einstein's\n[largely wrong. Whatever happened, Einstein and Hilbert\nsurvived. In May 1916\nEinstein gave a colloquium on Hilbert's work in Berlin [E61].** In May\n1917 he told a student from Goettingen, 'It is too great an audacity to draw\nalready now a picture of the world, since there are still so many things which we\ncannot yet remotely anticipate' [S6], an obvious reference to Hilbert's hopes for a\nunification of gravitation and electromagnetism. Einstein was thirty-eight when\nhe said that. Einstein, PAW, 1915, p. Lorentz, August 14, 1913.

Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2].\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.'

Its purpose was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of relativity. Einstein\nhimself had been invited to attend but had to decline for reasons of health. It marked the beginning of a\nseries of international congresses on general relativity and gravitation: GR1 was\nheld in Chapel Hill, N. The\n\"relativity family\" was born then. Some of the papers presented at the GR conferences after 1970 are found in the journal\nGeneral Relativity and Gravitation.\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 271\nulus for the vastly increased activity and the new directions in general relativity.\nThe few dozen practitioners in Einstein's days are followed by a new generation\nabout a hundred times more numerous. Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. In a\nletter to Ehrenfest he writes, 'I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant result'\n[L3]. His reply to Lorentz's letter shows a glimpse of the despair that\nwould ultimately overwhelm him: 'Your remark \"I have congratulated Einstein\non his brilliant results\" has a similar meaning for me as when one Freemason\nrecognizes another by a secret sign' [E4]. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6]. This may have\nencouraged Einstein\u2014who did not communicate all that badly\u2014to do more writ-\ning.\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments.\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition.\nWhat did Einstein himself have to say in later years about the three successes.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.\nOne of these caught Einstein's attention in 1936 when R. In any event, to Mandl's delight [M5] Einstein went\non to publish a calculation of the dependence of the image intensity upon the\ndisplacement of the observer from the extended line of centers of the two stars\n[E12b]. the theory of relativity and its connection\nwith his old ideas of the Erlangen program brought the last flare-up of his math-\nematical interests and mathematical production' [W9].) One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2]. (In view of the relations between Hilbert and Einstein, it is of\ninterest to note that in this last paper Hilbert refers to his subject as 'the new\n*For references to later calculations of this effect, see [S6a].\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 275\nphysics of Einstein's relativity principle' [H6].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nI repeat one last time that neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of the Bian-\nchi identities in that crucial November.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.\nIn October 1916 Einstein came back to energy-momentum conservation [E16]. Neither Hilbert nor Klein (nor, of course, Einstein) realized\nthat Eq.\n**An English translation of this paper is included in the well-known collection of papers by Einstein,\nLorentz, Minkowksi, and Weyl [S7].\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi. In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7]. At that time, Noether herself\ntold a friend that a team in Goettingen, to which she also belonged, was perform-\ning calculations of the most difficult kind for Einstein but that 'none of us under-\nstands what they are good for' [Dl].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. Einstein emphasized that,\ndespite appearances, Eq.\nThese results are of particular interest in that they show how Einstein was both\nundaunted by and quite at home with Riemannian geometry, which he handled\nwith ingenuity. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time.\nMany related questions continue to be studied intensely in the era of renewed\nactivity following Einstein's death. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity.\nEinstein contributed the quadrupole formula. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2. In the closing months\nof 1980, there appeared in the literature 'a contribution to the debate concerning\nthe validity of Einstein's quadrupole formula' [W16].\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end. It is the first occasion on which Einstein shows his excep-\ntional talent for drawing with sensitivity a portrait of a man and his work, placing\nhim in his time and speaking of his achievements and of his frailties with equal\ngrace.\nMach was successively a professor of mathematics, experimental physics, and\nphilosophy. In the obituary, Einstein lauded a number of diverse contributions\nbut reserved his highest praise for Mach's historical and critical analysis of\nmechanics [M6], a work that had profoundly influenced him since his student\ndays [E27], when he was introduced to it by Besso [E28].* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30]. In the obituary, Einstein cited extensively Mach's famous critique of New-\nton's concepts of absolute space and absolute motion and concluded, 'The cited\nplaces show that Mach clearly recognized the weak sides of classical mechanics\nand that he was not far from demanding a general theory of relativity, and that\nnearly half a century ago. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein. In February 1916, Einstein gave a lecture\non the Foucault pendulum [E31]., the Einstein-Grossmann] theory' [E32]. Even so, Einstein's esteem for Mach never faltered.\nIn the last interview given by Einstein, two weeks before his death, he reminisced\nwith evident pleasure about the one visit he had paid to Mach and he spoke of\nfour people he admired: Newton, Lorentz, Planck, and Mach [G2]. They, and\nMaxwell, and no others, are the only ones Einstein ever accepted as his true\nprecursors.\nIn a discussion of Mach's influence on Einstein, it is necessary to make a clear\ndistinction between three themes. As we have just seen, in\nthis regard Einstein's respect was and remained unqualified.\n'Mach fought and broke the dogmatism of nineteenth century physics' is one of\nthe rare approving statements Einstein ever made about Mach's philosophical\npositions [E34].'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27]. I would venture to guess that at this point Einstein had once again Mach's mechanics in\nmind.\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle. Let us\nsee how Einstein read Mach.\nSoon after Einstein arrived in Prague and broke his long silence on gravitation,\nhe published a short note entitled 'Does There Exist a Gravitational Action Anal-\nogous to the Electrodynamical Induction Effect. In June 1913, Einstein\nwrote to Mach about the induction effect as well as about the bending of light,\nadding that, if these effects were found, it would be 'a brilliant confirmation of\nyour ingenious investigations on the foundations of mechanics' [E38]. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39].\nA few days before presenting this paper to the Prussian Academy, Einstein had\nwritten to Ehrenfest, 'I have . It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].\nEinstein's paper is no doubt motivated by Machian ideas. There are three\nmain points in Einstein's paper. His solution, the Einsteinian universe, had to be abolished in later years.\nEinstein had applied Eq.' Thus Einstein began to give concrete form to\nMach's ideas: since the g^ determine the inertial action, they should, in turn, be\ncompletely determined by the mass distribution in the universe.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1.\nIn later years, Einstein's enthusiasm for Mach's principle waned and finally\nvanished. Einstein never said so explicitly, but it seems reasonable to assume that\nhe had in mind that the correct equations should have no solutions at all in the\nabsence of matter.' Einstein must have\nbeen disappointed.\n1919. This idea\nmay be considered Einstein's first attempt at a unified field theory.22)288 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7922. Einstein first believes the reasoning is incorrect [E45], then finds an error\nin his own objection [E46] and calls the new results 'clarifying. After Einstein, the Mach principle faded but never died.\nIn the post-Einsteinian era of revitalized interest in general relativity, it has\nbecome an important topic of research. Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper.\nThe scientific task which Einstein set himself in his later years is based on three\ndesiderata, all of them vitally important to him: to unify gravitation and electro-\nmagnetism, to derive quantum physics from an underlying causal theory, and to\ndescribe particles as singularity-free solutions of continuous fields. [E55]\nThat is the clearest expression I know of Einstein's profound belief in a descrip-\ntion of the world exclusively in terms of everywhere-continuous fields.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed. These phrases are found in a paper, prepared with Jacob Grommer,\nin which Einstein made his first contribution to the problem of motion.\nA few weeks later, Weyl wrote to Einstein, thanking him for the opportunity\nto see the galley proofs of his new paper and 'for the support [this paper] gives to\nmy old idea about matter' [W20], adding a reference to an article he had written\nin 1922 [W21] in which similar conclusions had been reached. Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's reply to Weyl is especially interesting because it adds to our under-\nstanding of his interest in this problem at that time.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion. It is the work done with Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann\n\"Havas's paper, which also contains a simple derivation of the Einstein-Grommer result, is one of\nseveral important articles on the problem of motion in modern guise found in a volume edited by J.\n292 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEOR\non asymmetries in the universe.

In the previous chapter, Einstein's role\nin the further development of this theory and its impact on later generations of\nphysicists were discussed. In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin. To begin with, I retur\nto the days just after November 1915, when Einstein completed his work on the\nfoundations of general relativity.\nAs was mentioned before, in December 1915 Einstein wrote to his friend Besso\nthat he was 'zufrieden aber ziemlich kaputt,' satisfied but rather worn out [El]. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI]. Einstein's reply shows that his indisposition was\nnot a trivial matter. 1899). In the\nsummer of 1917, Einstein moved from the Wittelsbacherstrasse to an apartment\nnext to Elsa's.\nBy that time, Albert and Elsa had decided to get married, and therefore Einstein\nhad to institute procedures to obtain a divorce from Mileva [E15]. It stipulated that Mileva would receive,\nin due course, Einstein's Nobel prize money. Perhaps the most remark-\nable characteristic of this period of illness is the absence of any lull in Einstein's\nscientific activity.*\nOn various occasions, Einstein would utter asides which expressed his reser-\nvations on the bliss attendant on the holy state of matrimony.\nIt was not the only time that Einstein wrote about his family with more frankness\nthan grace [E21]. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN. Soon\nthereafter, Einstein wrote to Zangger, 'My mother has died. Einstein Canonized\nIn the early fall of 1919, when Pauline Einstein was in the sanatorium, she\nreceived a postcard from her son which began, 'Dear Mother, joyous news today. The telegram that had\nannounced the news to Einstein a few days earlier read, 'Eddington found star\ndisplacement at the sun's edge preliminary between nine-tenth second and double\nthat.\nLet us briefly recapitulate Einstein's progress in understanding the bending of\nlight. He\nis still too close to Newton, who believed that space is flat and who could have\nhimself computed the 0*87 (now called the Newton value) from his law of grav-\nitation and his corpuscular theory of light. Several years pass before he understands that the curvature\nof space modifies the bending of light. 1915. The member of the Prussian Acad-\nemy discovers that general relativity implies a bending of light by the sun equal\nto 1 \"74, the Einstein value, twice the Newton value. This factor of 2 sets the stag\nfor a confrontation between Newton and Einstein.\nIn 1914, before Einstein had the right answer, he had written to Besso with\ntypical confidence. Frustration continued also after\nNovember 18, 1915, the day on which Einstein announced the right bending of\n1''74 [E30]. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].\nEnglish interest in the bending of light developed soon after copies of Einstein's\ngeneral relativity papers were sent from Holland by de Sitter to Arthur Stanley\nEddington at Cambridge (presumably these were the first papers on the theory to\nreach England).\nIn March 1917 the Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Watson Dyson, drew attention\nto the excellence of the star configuration on May 29, 1919, (another eclipse date)\nfor measuring the alleged deflection, adding that 'Mr Hinks has kindly under-\ntaken to obtain for the Society information of the stations which may be occupied'\n[Dl]., the Newton value]; or they may confirm Einstein's weird theory of non-\nEuclidean space; or they may lead to a result of yet more far-reaching conse-\nquences\u2014no deflection' [E35].f Lorentz cabled Einstein, whose excite-\n*For many details about all these early efforts, see especially [E32].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 305\nment on receiving this news after seven years of waiting will now be clearer. Then\ncame November 6, 1919, the day on which Einstein was canonized.f\nEver since 1905 Einstein had been beatus, having performed two first-class mir-\nacles.\nDyson, speaking first, concluded his remarks with the statement, 'After a careful\nstudy of the plates I am prepared to say that they confirm Einstein's prediction.\nA very definite result has been obtained, that light is deflected in accordance with\nEinstein's law of gravitation.' A few weeks later he added, 'The deflection of light by matter,\nsuggested by Newton in the first of his Queries, would itself be a result of first-\nrate scientific importance; it is of still greater importance when its magnitude sup-\nports the law of gravity put forward by Einstein' [Tl].\n*Silberstein, a native of Poland who moved to England and later settled in the United States, was\nthe author of three books on relativity.\n306 THE LATER JOURNEY\nOn October 22, Carl Stumpf, a psychologist and fellow member of the Prussian\nAcademy, wrote to Einstein, 'I feel compelled to send you most cordial congratu-\nlations on the occasion of the grandiose new success of your gravitation theory.* On November 3 Einstein replied, 'On my return\nfrom Holland I find your congratulations.\nA few days after the joint meeting of November 6, Lorentz sent another telegram\nto Einstein, confirming the news [L4]. On November 7, 1919, the Einstein legend\nbegan. The next day, the\nsame paper published a further article on the same subject headlined 'The revo-\nlution in science/Einstein v. Daily papers invited emi-\nnent physicists to comment. It is evident that Einstein's little book \"About the\nSpecial and General Theory of Relativity in Plain Terms\" did not find its way\ninto England during wartime. An article by Alexander Moszkowski entitled 'Die Sonne bracht' es an den Tag' in\nthe Berliner Tageblatt of October 8, 1919, must presumably have been based on information from\nEinstein himself.\nThe greatest possible interest had been\naroused in scientific circles by the hope that\nrival theories of a fundamental physical\nproblem would bo put to the test, and there was\na very large attendance of astronomers and\nphysicists. Tt was generally accepted that the\nobservations were derisive in the verifying of\nthe prediction of the famous physicist, Einstein,\nstated by the President of the Royal Society\nas being tho most remarkable scientific event\nsiiico the discovery of the predicted existence\nof the planet Neptune.\nKven the President of tho Royal Society, in\nstating that they had just listened to \" one of\nthe most momentous, if not the most moment-\nous, pronouncements of human thought,\" had\nto confess that no one had yet succeeded in\nstating in clear language what the theory of\nEinstein really was. It, was accepted, how\never, that Einstein, on tho bawls of hU theory,\nhad made three predictions. confident that the Einstein theory\nmust now be reckoned with, and that our con-\nceptions of the fabric of the universe must be\nfundamentally altered\nAt this stage Sir Oliver Lodge, whose con-\ntribution to the discussion had been eagerly\nexpected, left the meeting.' However, the weekly\nBerliner Illustrierte Zeitung of December 14 carried a picture of Einstein on its\ncover with the caption 'A new great in world history: Albert Einstein, whose\nresearches, signifying a complete revolution in our concepts of nature, are on a\npar with the insights of a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton.' As far as I know,\nthe first news in the Swiss papers is found in the Neue Zuricher Zeitung of\nDecember 10, where it is reported that the astronomer Henri Deslandres gave an\naccount of the May 29 observations before the December 8 session of the French\nAcademy of Sciences in which he summarized Einstein's theory by saying that\nenergy attracts energy.\nEinstein himself accepted 'with joy and gratefulness' the invitation to write a\nguest article in the London Times of November 28, for this gave him an oppor-\ntunity for communication 'after the lamentable breach in the former international\nrelations existing among men of science.' Referring to an earlier\ndescription of him in the London Times, he concluded his article as follows: 'By\nan application of the theory of relativity to the tastes of readers, today in Germany\nI am called a German man of science and in England I am represented as a Swiss\nJew.' The same Times issue carried an editorial reply, 'Dr Einstein pays\na well-intended if somewhat superfluous compliment to the impartiality of\nEnglish science,' to Einstein's first remark, followed by the comments, 'We con-\ncede him his little jest. But we note that, in accordance with the general tenor of\nhis theory, Dr Einstein does not supply any absolute description of himself\" in\nreply to his second remark. The best description I know of Einstein in 1919 is the\nphotograph on the cover of the Berliner Illustrirte, a picture of an intelligent,\nsensitive, and sensuous man who is deeply weary\u2014from the strains of intense\nthinking during the past years, from illnesses from which he has barely recovered,\nfrom the pain of watching his dying mother, and, I would think, from the com-\nmotion of which he was the center (See Plate II).\nNovember 1919 was not the first time Einstein and relativity appeared in the\nnews. In 1914 Einstein himself had\nwritten a newspaper article on relativity for Die Vossische Zeitung [E38]. For\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 309\nexample, The New York Times Index contains no mention of him until November\n9, 1919. Thus the birth of the Einstein legend can be pinpointed at Novem-\nber 7, 1919, when the London Times broke the news. The Times of\nNovember 9 contains a lead article on 'World outbreak plotted by Reds for\nNovember 7/Lenin's emissaries sought to start rising all over Europe' and a col-\numn on Einstein under the sixfold headline 'Lights all askew in the heavens/Men\nof science more or less agog over results of eclipse observation/Einstein theory\ntriumphs/Stars not where they seem or were calculated to be, but nobody need\nworry/A book for 12 wise men/No more in all the world could comprehend it,\nsaid Einstein when his daring publishers accepted it. more probable, however, that this often-quoted statement indeed origi-\nnated with Einstein himself and was made sometime in 1916, when he published\na pamphlet (with Earth in Leipzig) and a 'popular' book on relativity (with\nVieweg in Braunschweig).'

Copenhagen, June 1920: 'In recent days, papers of all opin-\nions have emphasized in long articles and interviews the significance of Professor\nEinstein, \"the most famous physicist of the present.'\nTokyo, January 1923: 'When Einstein arrived at the station there were such large\ncrowds that the police was unable to cope with the perilous crush .' On April 25, 1921,\nEinstein was received by President Harding on the occasion of his first visit to the\nUnited States. An eyewitness described the mood of the public when Einstein gave\na lecture in a large concert hall in Vienna that same year.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 311\nSo it was, and so it remained everywhere and at all times during Einstein's life. Compare, for example, the case of Einstein with the one and\nonly earlier instance in which a major discovery in physics had created a world-\nwide sensation under the influence of newspapers.\nThe essence of Einstein's unique position goes deeper and has everything to do,\nit seems to me, with the stars and with language. A new man appears abruptly,\nthe 'suddenly famous Doctor Einstein.\nIn the late years, when I knew him, fame and publicity were a source of amuse-\nment and sometimes of irritation to Einstein, whose tribe revered no saints. As I try to\nfind the best way to characterize Einstein's deeper response to adulation, I am\nreminded of words spoken by Lord Haldane when he introduced Einstein to an\naudience at King's College in London on June 13, 1921.' Then he went on to describe Einstein in these words:\nA man distinguished by his desire, if possible, to efface himself and yet impelled\nby the unmistakable power of genius which would not allow the individual of\nwhom it had taken possession to rest for one moment. Einstein's was no exception.\nIn the first instance, Einstein's role within the establishment was dictated by\nhis obligations, many of them administrative, to science. On May 5, 1916, he succeeded Planck as pres-\nident of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. Freundlich caused Einstein and others a certain amount of trouble [K4].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 313\nresearch institute only after Einstein left Germany. In that year he was also nominated president of the Einstein Stiftung, a\nfoundation for the promotion of work on experimental tests of general relativity. Its main piece of equipment, the Einstein Teleskop, was designed espe-\ncially for solar physics experiments. Einstein had no formal duties at the Univer-\nsity of Berlin.\nEinstein held one additional professorial position, this one in Holland. On October 27,\n1920, Einstein began his new position with an inaugural address on aether and\nrelativity theory.\nEinstein's physics of the 1920s was not only an exercise in administration and\nthe holding of professorships, however. First some\nremarks on Einstein's other activities during the Berlin period.\nIn the early days of the First World War, Einstein had for the first time pub-\nlicly advocated the cause of pacifism. The list of known pacifists appended to\nthe letter included Einstein's name [K5]. After the war, Einstein the outspoken\nsupranationalist became a figure detested by the growing number of German\nchauvinists.\nEinstein regarded his pacifism as an instinctive feeling rather than the result of\n\"The printed version of this lecture [E39] gives an incorrect date for its delivery. By aether Einstein\nmeant the gravitational field (one may wonder if this new name was felicitously chosen). 'The aether\nof the general theory of relativity is a medium without mechanical and kinematic properties, but\nwhich codetermines mechanical and electromagnetic events.) It is true that in 1932 he signed an appeal to the Socialist\nand Communist parties in Germany, urging them to join forces in order to stave\noff Germany's 'terrible danger of becoming Fascist' [K8], but as late as May 1933,\nthree months after Hitler came to power, Einstein still held to an unqualified\nantimilitarist position.\nEinstein's active interest in the fate of the Jews also began in the Berlin period. I am sure that Einstein's strongest source of\n\"Their influx was particularly noticeable in Berlin.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 315\nidentity, after science, was to be a Jew, increasingly so as the years went by.\nThere was one person who more than anyone else contributed to Einstein's\nawakening: Kurt Blumenfeld, from 1910 to 1914 secretary general of the Exec-\nutive of World Zionist Organizations, which then had its seat in Berlin, and from\n1924 to 1933 president of the Union of German Zionists. In a beautiful essay, Blumen-\nfeld has written of his discussions with Einstein in 1919, of his efforts 'to try to\nget out of a man what is hidden in him, and never to try to instill in a man what\nis not in his nature' [B3]. It was Blumenfeld whom Einstein often entrusted in\nlater years with the preparation of statements in his name on Zionist issues. It\nwas also Blumenfeld who was able to convince Einstein that he ought to join\nWeizmann on a visit to the United States (April 2-May 30, 1921) in order to\nraise funds for the planned Hebrew University. After having convinced Einstein, he wrote to Weizmann, 'As\nyou know, Einstein is no Zionist, and I beg you not to make any attempt to prevail\non him to join our organization. that you expect Einstein to give\nspeeches. Einstein .* As to his relations with Weizmann,\nEinstein once said to me, 'Meine Beziehungen zu dem Weizmann waren, wie der\nFreud sagt, ambivalent.'**\nThe extraordinary complexity of Einstein's life in the 1920s begins to unfold,\nthe changes in midlife are becoming clear.\nOn February 12, 1920, disturbances broke out in the course of a lecture given\nby Einstein at the University of Berlin. In a statement to the press,\nEinstein noted that there was a certain hostility directed against him which was\n*Part of this letter (dated incorrectly) is reproduced in [B3J.\nf See especially the events surrounding the awarding of the Nobel prize to Einstein, Chapter 30. On\nAugust 24, 1920, a newly founded organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft\ndeutscher Naturforscher, organized a meeting in Berlin's largest concert hall for\nthe purpose of criticizing the content of relativity theory and the alleged tasteless\npropaganda made for it by its author.* Einstein attended. Nevertheless,\nEinstein's article is a distinctly weak piece of writing, out of style with anything\nelse he ever allowed to be printed under his name. Einstein and Lenard were present.\nIt would, of course, have been easy for Einstein to leave Germany and find an\nexcellent position elsewhere.\nInvited by the College de France, Einstein went to Paris in March 1922 to\ndiscuss his work with physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers. In order to avoid demonstra-\ntions, Einstein left the train to Paris at a suburban station [L6]. Germany did not enter the League\nuntil 1926, and so Einstein was once again in an exposed position. On June 24\nWalter Rathenau, who had been foreign minister of Germany for only a few\nmonths, a Jew and an acquaintance of Einstein's, was assassinated. On July 4\nEinstein wrote to Marie Curie that he must resign from the committee, since the\nmurder of Rathenau had made it clear to him that strong anti-Semitism did not\nmake him an appropriate member [E47].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 317\nindividual [E48].*\nEvidently Einstein's life and moods were strongly affected by the strife and\nviolence in Germany in the early 1920s. There came a time when Einstein had to pay.\nIn the summer of 1929, Einstein bought a plot of land in the small village of\nGaputh, near Berlin, a few minutes' walk from the broad stream of the Havel.\nNot long after his recovery, Einstein was on the road again.\n*In 1927, Einstein, Curie, and Lorentz prepared a report for the committee, dealing with an inter-\nnational bureau of meteorology [E52]. Einstein's final resignation from the committee came in April\n1932 [D2].\n:f This was principally the doing of Millikan, who since 1924 had been urging Einstein to spend part\nof his time in Pasadena [M3].\n3l8 THE LATER JOURNEY\nIn December 1932 the Einsteins left once again for California. Einstein was one of the guests invited for a\nlunch in his honor. When Einstein came in Maillol observed, 'Une belle tele; c'est\nun poete.' And, said Kessler, 'I had to explain to him who Einstein was; he had\nevidently never heard of him' [K12]. All the papers Einstein published before finishing his\nwork on the formulation of general relativity deal either directly with research or\nwith reviews of research, with minor exceptions: a note in honor of Planck written\nin 1913 [E53] and reviews of booklets on relativity by Brill and by Lorentz\n[E53a]. From 1916 to 1920\nwe find the early eulogies\u2014to Mach, Schwarzschild, Smoluchowski, Leo Arons\u2014\nand a few more reviews of others' work\u2014of Lorentz's Paris lectures [E54], of\nHelmholtz's lectures on Goethe [E55], of Weyl's book on relativity [E56]. The more important of these contributions have been\nreprinted in various collections of Einstein essays.\nAfter 1920 Einstein wrote fairly often on scientific personalities. He was, of\ncourse, an obvious candidate for contributions commemorating Kepler [E57],\nNewton [E57a], and Maxwell [E58]. He wrote tributes [E62] to\nEhrenfest, Marie Curie, Nernst, Langevin, and Planck; also to Julius [E63],\nEdison [E64], Michelson [E65], and Noether [E66].\nEinstein had a lifelong interest in philosophy. As I already remarked in Chapter 1, calling Einstein\na philosopher sheds as much light on him as calling him a musician.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 319\nEven though Einstein's interest in and impact on philosophy were strong, he\nhimself never wrote articles that may be called philosophical in a technical sense. When one of these referred to a pos-\nsible connection between Einstein's ideas and those of Kant, Einstein replied:\nIn regard to Kant's philosophy, I believe that every philosopher has his own\nKant. [E72]\nFrom Einstein's introduction to a new translation of Galileo's Dialogue [E73], we\nsee that he had read Plato. His philosophical interests are also manifest in his\nreview of Emile Meyerson's La Deduction Relativiste [E76] and his introductions\nto books by Planck [E77] and Frank [E78].\nEinstein continued to consider philosophy ennobling in his later years.\nAmong the many contributions that show Einstein as a man of culture, I select\ntwo for brief additional comments.' Elsewhere Einstein wrote of Maxwell, 'Imagine his feelings when the dif-\nferential equations he had formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields\nspread in the form of polarized waves and with the speed of light.' Thus, according to Einstein, 'a legitimate conflict between science and reli-\ngion cannot exist.' By his own definition, Einstein himself was, of course, a deeply religious\nman. The Man of Science. With the formulation of the field equations of grav-\n32O THE LATER JOURNEY\nitation in November 1915, classical physics (that is, nonquantum physics) reached\nits perfection and Einstein's scientific career its high point. Despite much illness, his years\nfrom 1916 to 1920 were productive and fruitful, both in relativity and in quantum\ntheory.\nWho can gauge the extent to which the restlessness of Einstein's life in the\n1920s was the cause or the effect of a lessening of creative powers. It is my\nimpression that, after 1916, Einstein finally had some energy to spare for the\nworld in which he lived. Letters (not in the Princeton Archives) written by Einstein in\nthe early 1920s, showing that for several years he had a strong attachment to a\nyounger woman, express emotions for which, perhaps, he had no energy to spare\nin his marriages. That line was written only\nmonths before the discovery of quantum mechanics, the time at which a younger\ngeneration of physicists took over the lead while Einstein went his own way.\nI return to Einstein's physics. I deal with Einstein's work on unified field\ntheory first, since it is a direct outgrowth of general relativity, the last scientific\ntopic treated before the present long digression on the suddenly famous Doctor\nEinstein. Then I turn to Einstein and the quantum theory, begining once again\nwith events in the year 1905 and continuing from there until his final days.\nA line from a letter in 1928 from Einstein to Ehrenfest may serve as an epi-\ngraph to the later writings:\nI believe less than ever in the essentially statistical nature of events and have\ndecided to use the little energy still given to me in ways that are independent of\nthe current bustle.

Talmey, The Relativity Theory Simplified, p.", "Einstein_1929": " Particles and Fields around 1920\nEinstein died early on a Monday morning. [E2]\nNothing is more striking about the later Einstein than his change of position in\nregard to this advice, given when he was in his late thirties. Nothing in\nEinstein's scientific career was tragic, even though some of his work will be\nremembered forever and some of it will be forgotten. In any event, when Einstein\nembarked on his program for a unified field theory, his motivation was thoroughly\n325\n326 THE LATER JOURNEY\nphysical. In order to appreciate this, we must first have a brief look at the physics\nof particles and fields around 1920. Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus,\nBohr the quantum theory of the atom, Einstein general relativity. The neutrino was not postulated\nuntil 1929.\nWhen Einstein, Weyl, and others began their work on unified field theory, it\nwas natural to assume that this task consisted exlusively of the union of gravitation\nwith electromagnetism.\nThen it came to pass that physics veered toward a different course, neither led\nnor followed by Einstein. Amid all these developments, Einstein stayed with the unification\nof gravitation and electromagnetism, the final task he set himself. I\nturn next to an account of Einstein's own efforts at unification. The discussion of this second category is\npreceded by a brief excursion into post-Riemannian geometry and a comment on\nthe influence of Einstein's general relativity on mathematics. Einstein was well aware of this when, at age forty, he began\n328 THE LATER JOURNEY\nhis search for unification. In this chapter, nothing\nfurther will be said on Einstein and quantum physics. Another Decade of Gestation\nEinstein completed his first paper on unified field theory in January 1922. His statement to Ehrenfest in 1920, 'I have\nmade no progress in general relativity theory.\nNor were his interests in physics in those years confined to general relativity,\nwhether of the orthodox or of the unified variety. Late in 1924 and early in 1925, his three papers\non the Bose-Einstein gas were completed (see Chapter 23). There\nis the Einstein-Grommer paper of 1922 in response to the Kaluza theory (see\nSection 17c).\nFrom that time on, the character of Einstein's scientific output changes.\nHeisenberg's first paper on matrix mechanics [HI] and Einstein's first privately\ncreated unified field theory [E15] were both completed in July 1925; Schroedin-\nger's first paper on wave mechanics in January 1926 [SI]. Einstein's gestation\nperiod before he made the real plunge into unified field theory had lasted about a\ndecade, just as it had been for the special and the general theories of relativity.\nThis time, however, it was not he but others who in the end ushered in the new\nphysics. The first unification, based on a generalization of Riemannian\ngeometry in the usual four space-time dimensions, was proposed by Hermann\nWeyl in 1918 (see Section 17d).* His one paper on this subject was published\n*In 1914 Nordstrom had already proposed to use a five-dimensional space for the unification of\nelectromagnetism with a scalar gravitational field [Nl].\n330 THE LATER JOURNEY\nin 1921 [K2], but he already had this idea in 1919, for in April of that year\nEinstein wrote to him, 'The idea of achieving [a unified theory] by means of a\nfive-dimensional cylinder world never dawned on me. Still very much in the Machian mood, Einstein\nadded that one ought to examine whether this new theory would allow for a sen-\nsible solution of the cosmological problem.\n*As was mentioned in Section 15e, Einstein had used the cosmological term in 1919 for the purpose\nof linking electromagnetism to gravitation [E17].\nGeorge Uhlenbeck told me, 'I remember that in the summer of 1926, when Oskar Klein told us\nof his ideas which would not only unify the Maxwell with the Einstein equations but also bring in\nthe quantum theory, I felt a kind of ecstasy. However, Einstein had\nalready become actively interested in Kaluza's ideas before the appearance of\nKlein's papers in 1926. Einstein and the Kaluza-Klein Theory. In 1922 Einstein and Grommer\naddressed the question, Does Eq. It was a question Einstein had pondered\nearlier in the context of conventional general relativity. In what follows, we shall see that time and time again Einstein\nkept insisting on the existence of singularity-free solutions of source-free equations\nas a condition that must be met by a theory acceptable to him.\nEinstein's next papers on the five-dimensional theory are two short communi-\ncations in February 1927 [E19, E20]. In August 1926 Einstein wrote to\nEhrenfest that Grommer had drawn his attention to Klein's paper: 'Subject:\nKaluza, Schroedinger, general relativity' [E21].\nEinstein then remained silent on the subject of five dimensions until 1931, when\nhe and Walther Mayer (see Chapter 29) presented a new formalism 'which is\npsychologically connected with the known theory of Kaluza but in which an exten-\nsion of the physical continuum to five dimensions is avoided' [E24]. After 1932 we find no trace of this theory in Einstein's work. Bergmann informed me that he and Einstein also had worked\non this generalization [B3]. If he is interested in what not only Einstein but also men like Edding-\nton and Schroedinger tried to do with these geometries, turn to the next section. Relativity and Post-Riemannian Differential Geometry\nIn his address on general relativity and differential geometry to the Einstein Cen-\ntennial Symposium in Princeton [C3], the eminent mathematician Shiing-Shen\n*In that paper, one will find references to other recent work in this direction.19)\nUNIFIED FIELD THEORY 337\nGhern made two statements which apply equally well to the present section: 'It\nis a strange feeling to speak on a topic of which I do not know half the title', and\n'I soon saw the extreme difficulty of his [Einstein's] problem and the difference\nbetween mathematics and physics. Chern deals mainly with modern global problems of dif-\nferential geometry, such as the theory of fiber bundles, subjects which Einstein\nhimself never wrote about or mentioned to me. My own aim is to give an account\nof unified field theory in Einstein's day, when the concerns were uniquely with\nlocal differential geometry and when the now somewhat old-fashioned (and glob-\nally inadequate) general Ricci calculus was the main tool. Thus Einstein's labors had\na major impact on mathematics.\nWhen Weyl finished this work, he sent a copy to Einstein and asked him to\nsubmit it to the Prussian Academy [W3]. Einstein replied, 'Your ideas show a\nwonderful cohesion. Einstein was of course critical of the\nfact that the line element was no longer invariant. Some months later, he wrote to Einstein, '[Your criticism] very much\ndisturbs me, of course, since experience has shown that one can rely on your intu-\nition' [W4]. The Later Journey: a Scientific Chronology\nThe last period of Einstein's scientific activities was dominated throughout by\nunified field theory.\nThe most striking characteristics of his way of working in those years are not\nall that different from what they had been before: devotion to the voyage, enthu-\n*In 1921, Einstein wrote a not very interesting note in which he explored, in the spirit of Weyl, a\nrelativity theory in which only g^dx'dx' = 0 is invariant [E34]. Before I start with the chronology, I should stress that Einstein had three\ndistinct motives for studying generalizations of general relativity. First, he wanted\nto join gravity with electromagnetism.\n1922.\n1923. Put\nUNIFIED FIELD THEORY 343\nan equation akin to an Einstein equation with a cosmological constant.\nIt is all rather bizarre, a Ricci tensor which is the sum of a metric and an\nelectromagnetic field tensor. In 1923 Weyl declared the theory not fit for discus-\nsion ('undiskutierbar') [W5], and Pauli wrote to Eddington, 'In contrast to you\nand Einstein, I consider the invention of the mathematicians that one can found a\ngeometry on an affine connection without a [primary] line element as for the pres-\nent of no significance for physics' [P6].\nEinstein's own initial reaction was that Eddington had created a beautiful\nframework without content [E40].* Thus, romantically,\nbegan Einstein's adventures with general connections, adventures that were to\ncontinue until his final hours.\nEinstein set himself the task of answering a question not fully treated by\nEddington: what are the field equations for the forty fundamental FjJ, that take\nthe place of the ten field equations for the g^ in general relativity.21 and where the i had to be interpreted as the\nsources of the electromagnetic field.\nIn 1925 Einstein referred to these two objections at the conclusion to an appen-\ndix for the German edition of Eddington's book on relativity. Three papers on the Bose-Einstein gas, Einstein's last major innova-\ntive contribution to physics (see Chapter 23). Einstein's first homemade unified field theory, also the first example of a\npublicly expressed unwarranted optimism for a particular version of a unified\ntheory followed by a rapid rejection of the idea.\u201e, is once again the Ricci tensor (still a tensor, as was noted earlier).\nEinstein attempted to identify the symmetric part of gm with gravitation, the\nantisymmetric part 0^ with the electromagnetic field. Einstein himself realized soon after the publication of\nthis work that the results were not impressive. In a paper written in 1927 he remarked, 'As a result\nof numerous failures, I have now arrived at the conviction that this road [ Weyl\n\u2014\u00bb Eddington -* Einstein] does not bring us closer to the truth' [E48]. Einstein's work was done independently of Cartan, who was the first\nto introduce nonsymmetric connections (the antisymmetric parts of the Fj, are now\ncommonly known as Cartan torsion coefficients). This development has, of course,\nnothing to do with unification, nor was Einstein ever active in this direction].\n1921.\\ Einstein returns to the Kaluza theory.\n1928. Einstein's next try is particularly unusual, since\nthe most essential feature of the 'old' theory is lost from the very outset: the exis-\ntence of a nonvanishing curvature tensor expressed in terms of the connection by\nEq.\nIt began with a purely mathematical paper [E50], a rarity in Einstein's oeuvre,\nin which he invented distant parallelism (also called absolute parallelism or tele-\nwhere 1\"^ is defined by the rhs ot Eq.

In 1929, Einstein wrote a review of this theory [E51] to which, at his suggestion,\nCartan added a historical note [C7].\nOn November 4, 1928, The New York Times carried a story under the heading\n'Einstein on verge of great discovery; resents intrusion,' followed on November 14\nby an item 'Einstein reticent on new work; will not \"count unlaid eggs. On January 11,\n1929, he issued a brief statement to the press stating that 'the purpose of this work\nis to write the laws of the fields of gravitation and electromagnetism under a\nunified view point' and referred to a six-page paper he had submitted the day\nbefore [E52].\n'Einstein is amazed at stir over theory. But Einstein's name was magic, and shortly thereafter he heard from Edding-\nton.

Pauli on the\nother hand, was scathing in a review of this subject written in 1932: '[Einstein's]\nnever-failing inventiveness as well as his tenacious energy in the pursuit of [uni-\nfication] guarantees us in recent years, on the average, one theory per annum.\nEinstein held out awhile longer.\n1931-2\\.\n1933.

Einstein in 1912\n20a. Einstein's hypothesis was many years ahead of its decisive experimental\ntests. Einstein's first paper on the subject [El], submitted in November 1906,\ncontains the qualitatively correct explanation of an anomaly that had been\nobserved as early as 1840: the low value of the specific heat of diamond at room\ntemperature. Einstein showed that this can be understood as a quantum effect. It also represents one of only\nthree instances I know of in which Einstein published a graph to compare theory\nwith experiment (another example will be mentioned in Section 20b). As I just mentioned, peculiarities in specific heats were diagnosed more\nthan half a century before Einstein explained them.\nFor a perspective on Einstein's contributions, it is necessary to sketch the answer\nto these questions.\n**Weber was Einstein's teacher, whom we encountered in Chapter 3. They do not indicate that as a student Einstein knew of Weber's\nresults. We are therefore\nup to date in regard to the experimental developments preceding Einstein's work. Einstein was the first one to state\nthis fact clearly. Even though this is a topic that does\nnot directly bear on Einstein's work in 1906, I believe it will be useful to complete\nthe nineteenth century picture with a brief explanation of why gases caused so\nmuch more aggravation.\nSuch was the state of affairs when Einstein took on the specific heat problem. Einstein's work on specific heats [El] is above all\nimportant because it made clear for the first time that quantum concepts have a\nfar more general applicability. His 1906 paper is also unusual because here we\nmeet an Einstein who is quite prepared to use a model he knows to be approxi-\nmate in order to bring home a point of principle.\nEarlier in 1906 Einstein had come to accept Planck's relation (Eq. We saw in Section 19a that Planck had obtained the expression\nEINSTEIN AND SPECIFIC HEATS 395\nfor all n, where the value of the constant A is irrelevant.1, Einstein remarked, 'I believe\nwe should not content ourselves with this result' [El].\nEinstein's specific heat paper begins with a new prescription for arriving at the\nsame result.\nEinstein proposed a new form for w. Einstein applied Eq.4)\nwhich is Einstein's specific heat formula. For reasons of no particular interest to us now,\nEinstein initially believed that his oscillating lattice points were electrically\ncharged ions. Einstein's fit can be expressed in tem-\nperature units by 7^E ^ 1300 K, for which 'the points lie indeed almost on the\ncurve.\nBy his own account, Einstein took Weber's data from the Landolt-Bornstein\ntables. Apparently Einstein was not aware of these data in\n1906 (although they were noted in that year by German physicists [W3]).\nEinstein did become aware of this discrepancy in 1911, when the much\nimproved measurements by Nernst showed that Eq. Einstein himself explored some\nmodifications of this assumption [ E4]. Einstein had ended his active research on the specific heats of\nsolids by the time the work of Debye and the more exact treatment of lattice\nvibrations by Max Born and Theodore von Karman appeared [B7]. In 1913 Einstein correctly surmised that the effect was related to\nthe behavior of these rotations and attempted to give a quantitative theory. In a\npaper on this subject, we find another instance of curve fitting by Einstein [E6].*\nIn 1925 Einstein was to turn his attention one last time to gases at very low\ntemperatures, as we shall see in Section 23b. The final\n*In 1920 Einstein announced a forthcoming paper on the moment of inertia of molecular hydrogen\n[E7].* For the present account, it is important to note the influence of\nEinstein's work on this evolution. This is in qualitative agreement\nwith the theory developed by Herr Einstein. In 1906 Einstein gave the first example of a theory that\nimplies that cv \u2014\u00bb 0 as T \u2014> 0 for solids. In 1910 Nernst noted the compatibility\nof Einstein's result with 'the heat theorem developed by me.' However, it was\nactually Planck who, later in 1910, took a step that 'not only in form but also in\ncontent goes a bit beyond [the formulation given by] Nernst himself.\nNernst's reference to Einstein in his paper of 1910 was the first occasion on\n*Simon has given an excellent historical survey of this development [S2j.\nEINSTEIN AND SPECIFIC HEATS 399\nwhich he acknowledged the quantum theory in his publications.\nit has borne such rich fruits in the hands of Planck and Einstein that there is\nnow a scientific obligation to take a stand in its regard and to subject it to\nexperimental test.\nHe went on to compare Planck with Dalton and Newton [N6]. Also in 1911,\nNernst tried his hand at a needed modification of Einstein's Eq. Einstein was given the honor of being the final\nspeaker.

However, I do believe that\nit is a fair guess that Einstein felt he would have nothing fundamental to say about\nphotons until such time as he could find his own way of dealing with the lack of\ncausality he had noted in 1917.\nOther physicists had followed Einstein's work on quantum statistics with inter-\nest. I found a notice\nby Einstein in 1930 announcing a new paper on radiation fluctuations [E10].

In 1926,\nUhlenbeck himself raised an objection to Einstein's treatment of the condensation\nproblem [Ul]. Uhlenbeck and Einstein were both right, however. Shortly afterward, Uhlenbeck with-\ndrew his objections to Einstein's result, in a joint paper with his gifted student, the\nlate Boris Kahn (a Nazi victim) [K2].

The main purpose of this\nchapter is to stress Einstein's key role in these developments, his influence on de\nBroglie, de Broglie's subsequent influence on him, and, finally, the influence of\nboth on Schroedinger.\nNeither directly nor indirectly did Einstein contribute to an equally fundamen-\ntal development that preceded Schroedinger's discovery of wave mechanics: the\ndiscovery of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg [HI]. From Einstein to de Broglie\nDuring the period that began with Einstein's work on needle rays (1917) and\nended with Debye's and Gompton's papers on the Compton effect (1923), there\nwere a few other theoreticians also doing research on photon questions. 'After long reflection in solitude and meditation, I suddenly\nhad the idea, during the year 1923, that the discovery made by Einstein in 1905\nshould be generalized by extending it to all material particles and notably to elec-\ntrons' [B7]. Einstein\nreceived a copy of this thesis from Langevin, who was one of de Broglie's exam-\niners. A letter to Lorentz (in December) shows that Einstein was impressed and\nalso that he had found a new application of de Broglie's ideas:\nA younger brother of .

In his paper\nsubmitted on January 8, 1925, Einstein showed that Eq. 23. 23.\nWhen discussing radiation in 1909, Einstein recognized the second term of Eq.\nAt this point, Einstein turned to de Broglie's thesis [B7], 'a very notable pub-\nlication. 23. 23.\nIt is another of Einstein's feats that he would be led to state the necessity of the\nexistence of matter waves from the analysis of fluctuations. One may wonder what\nthe history of twentieth century physics would have looked like had Einstein\npushed the analogy still further. However, with the achievement of an indepen-\ndent argument for the particle-wave duality of matter, the twenty-year period of\nhighest scientific creativity in Einstein's life, at a level probably never equalled,\ncame to an end. In the course of preparing this chapter, I noticed\na recollection by Pauli of a statement made by Einstein during a physics meeting\nheld in Innsbruck in 1924. According to Pauli, Einstein proposed in the course of\nthat meeting 'to search for interference and diffraction phenomena with molecular\nbeams' [PI]. If Pauli's memory is correct, then Einstein made\nhis remark about two months prior to that time. After all, Einstein had\nbeen thinking about the molecular gas since July. The questions arise, When did\n438 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEinstein become aware of de Broglie's work.\nDe Broglie does not believe that Einstein was aware of his three short publi-\ncations [Bl, B2, B3] written in 1923. 'Nevertheless, since Einstein would receive\nthe Comptes Rendus and since he knew French very well, he might have noticed\nmy articles' [B8]. 'I am certain that Einstein knew of my\nThese since the spring of 1924' [B9]. Langevin, probablement un peu etonne par la nouveaute\nde mes idees,* asked me to furnish him with a second typed copy of my These for\ntransmittal to Einstein. It was then that Einstein declared, after having read my\nwork, that my ideas seemed quite interesting to him.

In the present chapter, I shall describe how Einstein's position concerning\nquantum mechanics evolved in the course of time. 1925-31: The Debate Begins\nSchroedinger was not the only one who had profited from the study of Einstein's\nthree papers on the new gas theory.\nAlso Einstein himself continued thinking about the meaning of wavefields, old\n440\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 441\nand new. Eugene Wigner, who was in Berlin in 1925, told me that Einstein had\nat that time the idea of wavefields serving as 'Fiihrungsfelder,' guiding fields, for\nlight-quanta or other particles, one field for each particle.\nAs was mentioned earlier, Einstein considered his work on the quantum gas\nonly a temporary digression. During the very early days of quantum mechanics,*\nwe find him 'working strenuously on the further development of a theory on the\nconnection between gravitation and electricity' [E3]. Bose, who visited\nBerlin in November 1925, recalled that 'Einstein was very excited about the ne\nquantum mechanics. Einstein's deep interest in quantum mechanics\nmust have led him to write to Heisenberg soon after the publication of the latter's\npaper [H2].** All the letters from Einstein to Heisenberg have been lost. How-\never, a number of letters from Heisenberg to Einstein are extant. (dated November 30, 1925) is clearly in response to an earlier letter from Einstein\nto Heisenberg in which Einstein appears to have commented on the new quantum\nmechanics. I\nfind it remarkable that Einstein apparently sensed that there was some connection\nbetween the BKS theory and quantum mechanics.\n**The two men met for the first time in the spring of 1926. Could Einstein have surmised as early as 1925 that some statistical element\nis inherent in the quantum mechanical description.\nDuring the following months, Einstein vacillated in his reaction to the Heisen-\nberg theory. In view of the scientific links between Einstein's and Schroe-\ndinger's work, it is not surprising that Einstein would express real enthusiasm\nabout wave mechanics: 'Schroedinger has come out with a pair of wonderful\npapers on the quantum rules', he wrote in May 1926 [E10]. [Bl]\nOne month later, Born wrote a more elaborate sequel to this paper, in which he\npointed out that the starting point of his considerations was 'a remark by Einstein\non the relation between [a] wavefield and light-quanta; he [E.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 443\nand spoke in this sense of a \"Gespensterfeld\"', ghost field [B2], clearly a reference\nto Einstein's idea of a Tuhrungsfeld.' Shortly thereafter, Born wrote to Einstein:\nMy idea to consider Schroedinger's wavefield as a 'Gespensterfeld' in your sense\nof the word proves to be more useful all the time. [B3]*\nOnce more, but now for the last time, we encounter Einstein as a transitional\nfigure in the period of the birth of quantum mechanics.** Einstein's position in the\nyears to follow can be summarized succinctly by saying that he took exception to\nevery single statement in Bern's papers and in the letter Born subsequently wrote\nto him.\n'Einstein's verdict . There are other\ninstances as well in which Einstein's reactions were experienced with a sense of\nloss, of being abandoned in battle by a venerated leader. Needless to say, Einstein's reactions affected the older generation more\nintensely than the younger.\nFebruary 1927. In a lecture given in Berlin, Einstein is reported to have said\nthat 'what nature demands from us is not a quantum theory or a wave theory;\nrather, nature demands from us a synthesis of these two views which thus far has\nexceeded the mental powers of physicists' [El2]. At this point in the developments,\nas others are about to take over, it should be recalled one more time that as early\n\"This important letter is not included in the published Born-Einstein correspondence. (In this paper,\nHeisenberg, too, referred to 'Einstein's discussions of the relation between waves\nand light-quanta.') In June 1927 Heisenberg writes a letter to Einstein which\nbegins, 'Many cordial thanks for your kind letter; although I really do not know\nanything new, I would nevertheless like to write once more why I believe that\nindeterminism, that is, the nonvalidity of rigorous causality, is necessary [his ital-\nics] and not just consistently possible' [H7]. This letter is apparently in response\nto another lost letter by Einstein, triggered, most probably, by Heisenberg's work\nin March. In fact, at just about\nthat time, he was doing his own research on quantum mechanics (his first, I\nbelieve). Heisenberg had heard\nindirectly that Einstein 'had written a paper in which you . Einstein eventually withdrew his paper.\nOctober 1927. As was mentioned in\nChapter 23, Einstein had declined an invitation to give a paper on quantum sta-\ntistics at that conference. All par-\nticipants were housed in the same hotel, and there, in the dining room, Einstein\nwas much livelier. Otto Stern has given this first-hand account**:\n\"This is the title of a paper Einstein submitted for the May 5, 1927, meeting of the Prussian Acad-\nemy in Berlin. The records show that the paper was in print when Einstein requested by telephone\nthat it be withdrawn. The unpublished manuscript is in the Einstein archive.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 445\nEinstein came down to breakfast and expressed his misgivings about the new\nquantum theory, every time [he] had invented some beautiful experiment from\nwhich one saw that [the theory] did not work.\nThus began the great debate between Bohr and Einstein. Between 1925 and 1931, the only objection by Einstein that\nappeared in print in the scientific literature is the one at the 1927 Solvay confer-\nence [E13]. However, there exists a masterful account of the Bohr-Einstein dia-\nlogue during these years, published by Bohr in 1949 [B6]. I have written else-\nwhere about the profound role that the\" discussions with Einstein played in Bohr's\nlife [PI].\nThe record of the Solvay meeting contains only minor reactions to Einstein's\ncomments. Let us consider next the\nsubstance of Einstein's remarks.\nEinstein's opening phrase tells more about him than does many a book: 'Je dois\nm'excuser de n'avoir pas approfondi la mecanique des quanta,' I must apologize\nfor not having penetrated quantum mechanics deeply enough [El3]*.\nQuantum mechanics provides the following answer to Einstein's query. As we shall see, what was and is an\naccepted renunciation to others was an intolerable abdication in Einstein's eyes.\nI have dwelt at some length on this simple problem since it contains the germ\nof Einstein's position, which he stated more explicitly in later years. Meanwhile,\nthe debate in the corridors between Bohr and Einstein continued during the sixth\nSolvay Conference (on magnetism) in 1930. This time Einstein thought he had\nfound a counterexample to the uncertainty principle. During\nthe whole evening he was extremely unhappy, going from one to the other and\ntrying to persuade them that it couldn't be true, that it would be the end of physics\nif Einstein were right; but he couldn't produce any refutation.\nAfter this refutation by Bohr, Einstein ceased his search for inconsistencies. This paper, a forerunner of\nthe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article to be discussed below, need not be remem-\nbered for its conclusions.\nA far more important expression of Einstein's opinions is found in a letter he\nwrote the following September.' Einstein had\nalready proposed Heisenberg and Schroedinger in 1928, and proposed Schroedinger again in 1932\n(see Chapter 31).\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 449\nNot that from then on he desisted from criticizing quantum mechanics.\nDuring the last twenty-five years of life, Einstein maintained that quantum\nmechanics was incomplete.\nIn November 1931 Einstein gave a colloquium in Berlin 'on the uncertainty\nrelation' [El6]. The report of this talk does not state that Einstein objected to\nHeisenberg's relations. My friend Gasimir has written to me about a colloquium Einstein gave\nin Leiden, with Ehrenfest in the chair [Cl] (this must have been in November\n1930). In his talk, Einstein discussed several aspects of the clock-in-the-box exper-\niments. Einstein reacted to this statement as follows: 'Ich weiss es,\nwiderspruchsfrei ist die Sache schon, aber sie enthalt meines Erachtens doch eine\ngewisse Harte' (I know, this business is free of contradictions, yet in my view it\ncontains a certain unreasonableness).\nIt was in 1935 that Einstein stated his own desiderata for the first time in a\nprecise form. By 1935 Einstein was settled in Princeton. At this point, I\ninterrupt the account of the quantum theory in order to describe what happened\nto Einstein and his family from 1932 to 1945. Einstein at Princeton\nEinstein settled permanently in the United States in October 1933.\nEinstein's decision to move to Princeton was the result of three meetings with\nAbraham Flexner [Fl]. On that occasion, he\nwas introduced to Einstein. When they met again in Oxford, in the spring of 1932, Flexner asked if\nEinstein himself might be interested in joining the Institute. At their third meeting,\nin Caputh in June 1932, Einstein said he was enthusiastic about coming, provided\nhe could bring his assistant, Walther Mayer; for himself he requested an annual\nsalary of $3000.\nEinstein originally intended to spend five months of the year in Princeton and\nthe rest of the time in Berlin [K2]. The situation deteriorated rapidly, however, and in a letter dated\nMarch 28, 1933, Einstein sent his resignation to the Akademie in Berlin [K4].\nMarch 28 was also the day on which the Einsteins arrived in Antwerp, return-\ning from California. Rumors were rife of planned attempts on\nEinstein's life. Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser saw\n*On April 21 he also resigned from the Bavarian Academy.\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 451\nto it that Einstein's papers in Berlin were saved and sent to the Quai d'Orsay by\nFrench diplomatic pouch. Einstein\ntraveled.\nIn the midst of these happenings, Einstein and Mayer managed to do a little\nphysics and complete two papers on semivectors, which they sent from Le Goq to\nHolland for publication in the Royal Dutch Academy proceedings [E21, E22].\nThese were sequels to a joint paper they had finished a few days before Einstein\nhad set off for Pasadena [E23]. They went on to relate semi-\n*A report in The New York Times [N2] that Einstein was present at a Zionist Congress in Prague\nin August is incorrect.*\nOn September 9 Einstein left the Continent for good. On October 7 Einstein joined them in Southampton.\nOn October 17 they arrived in New York and were met at quarantine by Edgar\nBamberger and Herbert Maass, trustees of the Institute, who handed Einstein a\nletter from Flexner, the Institute's first director. It was to be Einstein's last home. This was Einstein's last trip outside the United States.\n**One biographer's story [C2] that Mayer had joined Einstein in England is incorrect.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 453\nIn 1938 Einstein's son Hans Albert came to the United States. In 1930\ntheir son Bernhard Caesar was born, Einstein's first grandchild.\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Einstein gave the Queen of Belgium\nhis early impressions of Princeton: 'A quaint ceremonious village of puny demi-\ngods on stilts' [E24]. Even a man with a strong inner life like Einstein had to\nadjust himself to a new environment.\nEinstein went on with his physics.\n454 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nDuring the years 1933-45 Einstein spoke out less on political issues than he\nhad done before or would do again after the war.\nMuch has been written about Einstein's letters to President Roosevelt on the\nimportance of the development of atomic weapons [E26].\nThe story of Einstein in Princeton will be continued and concluded in Chapter\n27. Before returning to objective reality, I mention one anecdote of Einstein's early\nyears in the United States, a story I owe to Helen Dukas.\nDuring a speech by a high official at a major reception for Einstein, the honored\nguest took out his pen and started scribbling equations on the back of his program,\noblivious to everything. Everybody stood\nup, clapping hands and turning to Einstein. Einstein on Objective Reality\nIn his Como address, Bohr had remarked that quantum mechanics, like relativity\ntheory, demands refinements of our everyday perceptions of inanimate natural\nphenomena. 'We find ourselves here on the very path taken by Einstein of adapt-\ning our modes of perception borrowed from the sensations to the gradually deep-\nening knowledge of the laws of Nature' [B5].\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 455\nrefers to our ordinary perception.\nIn contrast to the view that the concept of phenomenon irrevocably includes the\nspecifics of the experimental conditions of observation, Einstein held that one\nshould seek for a deeper-lying theoretical framework which permits the descrip-\ntion of phenomena independently of these conditions.\nIn an article written in 1935 with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen [E27],\nEinstein gave reasons for his position by discussing an example, simple as always. On May 4, 1935, The New York Times carried an article under the\nheading 'Einstein attacks quantum theory,' which also includes an interview with another physicist.\nIts May 7 issue contains a statement by Einstein in which he deprecated this release, which did not\nhave his authorization.\nThe only part of this article that will ultimately survive, I believe, is this last\nphrase, which so poignantly summarizes Einstein's views on quantum mechanics\nin his later years.\nThis concludes an account of Einstein's position.* I\nhave chosen to confine myself to the exchanges between Einstein and Bohr because\nI believe that Einstein's views come out most clearly in juxtaposing them with\nBohr's. Bohr was in Princeton when he put the\n*In 1950 Einstein mentioned Schroedinger and von Laue as the only ones who shared his views\n[E32].\nNote also that the term hidden variable does not occur in any of Einstein's papers or letters, as far\nas I know.\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 457\nfinishing touches to his 1949 article [B6], and we discussed these matters often at\nthat time. (It was during one of these discussions that Einstein sneaked in to steal\nsome tobacco [PI].\nIt has been stressed many times that, in order to follow Einstein's thinking, it\nis necessary to see him both as a critic and as a visionary.

It is important to note that by fictitious Einstein meant free inventions of\nthe human mind.)\nIn the Spencer lecture, Einstein mentioned the success not only of classical\nmechanics but also of the statistical interpretation of quantum theory.'\n460\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 461\nFrom this lecture as well as from discussions with him on the foundations of\nquantum physics, I have gained the following impression. Einstein tended to com-\npare the successes of classical mechanics with those of quantum mechanics. For more than a decade,\nEinstein had pondered the single question of how to extend the invariance under\nuniform translations to general motions. It is quite plausible that the\nvery success of his highest achievement, general relativity, was an added spur to\nEinstein's apartness. [E2]\n(3) Instead\u2014and this was Einstein's main point\u2014one should start all over\nagain, as it were, and endeavor to obtain the quantum theory as a by-product of\na general relativistic theory or a generalization thereof. That is the single most important link between the early and\nthe late Einstein. Einstein knew that.\nEinstein's apartness in regard to the foundations of quantum physics predates\nthe discovery of quantum mechanics. That is the second most important link\nbetween the early and the later Einstein. I shall enlarge on this in Section 26c, but\nfirst some final Comments on the subject of Chapter 2: Einstein's general attitude\ntoward the quantum and relativity theories. But Einstein did not do that. As we saw\nin Section 21c, in his 1917 paper Einstein ascribed to light-quanta an energy E\n= hv and a momentum p = hv/c.\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 463\nconsidered justified only if it has been shown that according to [the theory] the\nmomentum transferred by radiation to matter leads to motions as required by\nthermodynamics' [El6]. In the previous section, I noted that Einstein considered\nquantum mechanics to be highly successful. Valentin Bargmann has told me that at one time Einstein asked him for a\nprivate survey of quantum field theory, beginning with second quantization. Thereafter Einstein's interest waned. Was that what bothered Einstein. [E19]\n'That programme' is uniquely Einstein's. As a\npersonal opinion, it seems to me that making great discoveries can be accompanied\nby trauma, and that the purity of Einstein's relativity theories had a blinding effect\non him. Uberkausalitat\nIn 1923 Einstein published an article entitled 'Does field theory offer possibilities\nfor the solution of the quantum problem.'\nBy 1923 Einstein had already been brooding about these ideas for a number of\nyears. The early response of others to these attempts\nby Einstein was recorded by Born: 'In those days [early 1925], we all thought that\nhis objective . Einstein himself\nfelt that he had no choice.\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 465\nOverdetermination was and remained Einstein's hope for an answer to the\nquantum problem.\nAt long last, I can now explain Einstein's vision. Einstein had\nall these criteria in mind when he wrote, in 1949, 'Our problem is that of finding\nthe field equations of the total field' [E3]. Einstein's scientific evolution can there-\nfore be schematized by the picture given in the preface:\nSpecial relativity Statistical physics\nI I\nGeneral relativity Quantum theory\n^ Unified \"^\nfield theory\nIn Chapter 171 discussed that portion of Einstein's work on unified field theory\nthat dealt with the synthesis of gravitation and electromagnetism. And in 1954, 'I must seem like an ostrich who forever\nburies its head in the relativistic sand in order not to face the evil quanta' [E27].\n466 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nForever and in vain, Einstein kept looking for hints that would help him realize\nhis vision of a quantum theory derived from a unified field theory. A report in 1931 by Einstein on a five-dimen-\nsional theory which should unify gravitation and electromagnetism ends, 'This\ntheory does not yet contain the conclusions of the quantum theory' [E31]. One phrase in this paper, 'one does not see\na priori whether the theory contains the quantum phenomena' illustrates once\nagain the scope of the program that was on Einstein's mind.)\nSimplicity was the guide in Einstein's quest.\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 467\nfeeling sure that in nature is actualized the ideal of mathematical simplicity' [E4].\n'The theory of relativity and the quantum theory .* To his dear friend Besso he wrote in 1954,\n'I consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept, i. In one of the last of the many introductions Einstein wrote\nfor books by others, he said:\nMy efforts to complete the general theory of relativity . [E38]\nBut, as Helen Dukas told me, Einstein once said at the dinner table (she did not\nrecall the year) that he thought physicists would understand him a hundred years\nlater. Bargmann informs me that Einstein made similar remarks to him in the late 1930s.\n468 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEinstein kept thinking about quantum theory until the very end.

Every night after\ndinner, Einstein would go to the room of his sister, who was so dear to him, and\nread to her.\nPhysics remained at the center of Einstein's being in the final decade, during\nwhich, as I described earlier, he concentrated exclusively on unified field theory\n473\n474 JOURNEY S END\nand on questions of principle regarding the quantum theory. Those were the days\nof striking advances in quantum electrodynamics and unexpected discoveries of\nnew particles, days in which the gap between Einstein's physics and the physics\nof younger generations was ever widening.\nAt no time did Einstein immerse himself more in problems of policy and politics\nthan during the years following the end of the Second World War.\nEinstein further believed in the necessity 'to advance the use of atomic energy\n*In a letter concerning a conscientious objector [Nl] and in another one to William Frauenglass, a\nhigh-school teacher who had been called to appear before the House Committee on Un-American\nActivities [N2].* In 1954 Einstein sided with the\noverwhelming majority of atomic scientists who publicly condemned the United\nStates government's actions in the security case against Oppenheimer.\nEinstein's political views in the post-war years centered, I believe, on the themes\njust described. The reader interested in a more complete picture of his actions and\nbeliefs is referred once again to the book Einstein on Peace [Nl], in which the\ndocumentation of this period, covering hundreds of pages, illustrates how much\neffort Einstein devoted in his last years to issues dealing with the world's future.\nTwo further issues, bearing on Einstein's political views but going much\ndeeper, must be mentioned.' It appears to me that Einstein's Jewish identity emerged ever more\nstrongly as he grew older.\nDuring the last years of his life, Einstein was not well. He sug-\ngested an experimental laparotomy, to which Einstein consented. Einstein stayed in the hospital until the incision had sufficiently healed.\nOn March 18, 1950, Einstein put his signature to his last will and testament. What happened\nnext has been described by a friend who was with Einstein that evening.\nThe end came in 1955.\nIn March of that year, Einstein had occasion to remember three old friends. In this note, he mentioned 'the need\nto express at least once in my life my gratitude to Marcel Grossmann,' the friend\nwhose notebooks he had used as a student, who had helped him to get a job at the\npatent office, to whom he had dedicated his doctoral thesis, and with whom he\nhad written his first paper on the tensor theory of general relativity.\nOn the morning of Wednesday, April 13, the Israeli consul called on Einstein\nat his home in order to discuss the draft of a statement Einstein intended to make\non television and radio on the occasion of the forthcoming anniversary of Israel's\nindependence.'\nThese may well be the last phrases Einstein committed to paper.\nThat afternoon Einstein collapsed at home. That evening, two med-\nical friends of Einstein's were called to Princeton from New York: Rudolf Ehr-\nmann, who had been his physician in Berlin, and Gustav Bucky, a radiologist. After the doctors had deliberated, Einstein\nasked Dr Dean if it would be a horrible death. On Saturday Einstein called the\nhouse to ask for his glasses.\nAlberta Rozsel, a night nurse at the hospital, was the last person to see Einstein\nalive. Einstein mumbled in German.

Since I was about to take a\nterm's leave from Princeton, I called Helen Dukas and asked her to be kind\nenough to give my best wishes to Professor Einstein. After I\narrived, I went upstairs and knocked at the door of Einstein's study.\n479\nThis page intentionally left blank VIII\nAPPENDICES\nThis page intentionally left blank 29\nOf Tensors and a Hearing Aid\nand Many Other Things:\nEinstein's Collaborators\nAll of Einstein's major papers are his alone. Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.\nAll of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the\nformative stages of their development. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. Laub published on special relativity as early as 1907\n[LI]. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2].* In 1910, Laub wrote the first major\nreview article on the experimental basis of special relativity [L3]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909. 1876, and Franz Paul,\nb.\nAs the result of a note on voltage fluctations in a condenser, 'a phenomenon\nsimilar to Brownian motion' [E3], that Einstein wrote in 1907, he became inter-\nested in the possibility of amplifying small voltage differences.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 485\nstein was quite excited about his invention, and at one time must have even con-\nsidered patenting it.

Hopf\nmet Einstein in September 1909 at the Salzburg physics meeting and soon joined\nhim at the University of Zurich as his assistant. Hopf arranged a meeting between\nEinstein and Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst [SI]. Assistant to Einstein in Prague. 'The many hours Einstein and my\nfather spent together in Einstein's study, his world view and character left a lasting\nimpression on my father. He was fond of Einstein's first wife and regretted\ntheir separation. After Einstein's return to\nZurich, Nohel became a mathematics teacher at the Handelsakademie in Vienna,\na post he retained until the Anschluss of 1938. Einstein attempted to help Nohel but without success\n[E12]. Otto Stern, b. PhD in\n1912 in physical chemistry with Otto Sackur in Breslau.

Grossmann and his\nfather were instrumental in getting Einstein appointed to the patent office in Bern.\nIn 1905 Einstein dedicated his PhD thesis to the younger Grossmann. Einstein remembered Grossmann with gratitude in his last autobiograph-\nical sketch [E14].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 487\n9.

Fokker worked with Einstein in Zurich dur-\ning the winter semester in 1913-14.\nLorentz) went to Berlin, where he worked first in the laboratory of Henri du Bois\nand then with Einstein at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt.\nGrommer worked with Einstein for ten years, the longest period any person\ncollaborated with him. The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-\neral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21]. 1880, Vienna. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists. 1876, Berlin. He first met Einstein in 1915. The meeting came about because of a chance\nencounter between the Miihsams and Elsa Einstein. On that occasion Muhsam\ntold Elsa that he had heard of Albert Einstein and that she, Elsa, had a famous\nname. When Einstein heard of this, he became curious and got in touch with the\nMiihsams.

Tor a long period, Einstein visited us daily in Berlin' [M2]. Mrs\nMiihsam wrote to Seelig after her husband's death, 'Do you know that Einstein\nonce said to me, \"First comes your husband, then for a long while comes nothing,\nand only then come all other people\". I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. When Miihsam once asked what would have become of Einstein if he had\nbeen born the son of poor Russian Jews, Einstein replied that he would probably\nhave become a rabbi [S6]. Muhsam could have informed us better than anyone\nelse about personal events which may well have contributed to Einstein's becoming\na figure who went his lonely separate way in physics after 1926.\nEinstein and Muhsam kept in touch after the Einsteins had settled in the\nUnited States and the Miihsams had fled from Germany to Israel. A letter from\nEinstein in 1942 still shows personal touches: 'I have become a lonely old chap\nwho is mainly known because he does not wear socks and who is exhibited as a\ncuriosum on special occasions' [E27]. 'As soon as it became clear to Szilard that physics was his real interest,\nhe introduced himself, with characteristic directness, to Albert Einstein. I believe\nit was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-\nics. PhD in Berlin in 1922\nwith von Laue.\nEinstein and Szilard made a considerable number of joint patent applications,\neight German (November 1927-December 1930), six British (December 1927-\nDecember 1929), one U. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent\noffice in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928). All the German pat-\n490 APPENDICES\nents were awarded after Einstein had left that country. In 1927 Einstein autho-\nrized Szilard to apply in his own name for patents abroad of some of their joint\nventures [E28]. Their principal novelty was the so-called Ein-\nstein-Szilard pump, later described by Einstein in general terms. On August 2,1939, he and Eugene Wigner called on Einstein\nto urge him to bring the need for action on the development of atomic weapons to\nthe attention of President Roosevelt. Rudolf Goldschmidt.\n**I am grateful to Professor Goldschmidt's daugther-in-law Rose Goldie from New Maiden, Surrey,\nEngland, and to Horst Melcher from Potsdam for information which was of great help to me in the\npreparation of this note on the Einstein-Goldschmidt patent. I first became aware of this patent\nthrough Professor Melcher's papers [M4, M5],\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 491\nused in the first radiotelegraphic link between Germany and the United States,\nopened on June 19, 1914, with an exchange of telegrams between Wilhelm II and\nWoodrow Wilson. One of these, German patent 590783, held\njointly with Einstein, has the following history. An acquaintance of Einstein, a\ndistinguished singer, had become hard of hearing. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-\nschmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. Einstein's\naddress is given as 'Earlier in Berlin, present residence unknown.'\nGoldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-\nrespondence with Einstein, d. PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.\nLanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over\na dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. In 1928,\nEinstein wrote to Erwin Madelung in Frankfurt am Main, asking if it would be\npossible for Lanczos to have a year's leave of absence from his position as an\nassistant and Privatdozent at the University of Frankfurt in order to work with\nEinstein on problems in unified field theory [E30]. A week later, Lanczos wrote\nto Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4].\nEinstein refers to Lanczos' work in one of his articles on distant parallelism [E31],\na subject on which Lanczos wrote a review two years later [L5]. He\nwrote a number of books, three of which deal with Einstein, his oeuvre, and his\ninfluence [L6, L7, L8].\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.* Einstein acknowledged Miintz's work in two papers on distant\nparallelism [E31, E33].\nAfter the departure of Lanczos and Miintz, Einstein contacted Richard von\nMises in Vienna to ask if he knew of someone interested in working with him. The Einstein-Mayer\ncollaboration started soon after and was at once a success. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35]. In October\nEinstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which\na new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-\ntime continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point\n[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. It deals with semi-vectors and spinors\n[E38] and was the last paper published by Einstein in the Sitzungsberichte of the\nPreussische Akademie.\nMeanwhile, in October 1932, Einstein had been appointed professor at The\nInstitute for Advanced Study with the understanding that his first period in\nPrinceton would start in October 1933.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493\nham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-\nment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-\ntion. After other conditions of his professorship had been settled to mutual\nsatisfaction, Einstein wrote to Flexner, 'Now my only wish is that Herr Dr W. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work .\nEinstein prevailed, and Mayer was given a tenured position with the title of\nassociate, the only appointment of its kind ever made by the Institute. The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,\nwhen the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c). I was sure that Einstein had not\ndone the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function\ninstead. The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen. In\n1936 they published a note on the general relativistic two-body problem [E51] and\nin 1937 a paper on cylindrical gravitational waves [E52].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. At\nthat time Rosen was in the Soviet Union, where Einstein had helped him to obtain\na temporary position. The little man with the pince-nez must have replied to the good\nprofessor, for shortly afterward Einstein wrote again to Molotov to thank him for\nhis help [E56]. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein.\nThe Buckys and the Einsteins became friends after the two families moved to the\nUnited States. Leopold Infeld. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote\nabout his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. In 1929 Hoffmann\nstarted work on projective relativity with Veblen. A member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1935-7. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3]. 1915, Berlin. PhD in 1936 in Prague with\nPhilipp Frank, who recommended him to Einstein. Einstein wrote an introduction\nto Bergmann's textbook on relativity [E65].\nBargmann and Einstein published two papers together, the one with Bergmann\njust mentioned [E64] and a paper on bivectors [E66]. Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]\non relativity theory. Ernst Gabor Straus, b. 1922, Munich. Assistant to Einstein 1944-8. At\nthe time Straus came to work with Einstein, the latter was much interested in the\nproblem of finding generalizations of general relativity that are not based on dif-\nferential geometry. Two\nexamples of such generalizations (about which Einstein never published) are\nfound in Straus's reminiscences [Wl].\n\"Einstein also wrote a sequel to this paper [E67].\nfThis is an improved version of an earlier result obtained by Einstein alone [E70].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 497\nwithout awareness of numerous earlier contributions to this subject by others\n[E72]. 1926, Budapest. Assistant to Einstein 1948-9. Kemeny\nwrote to me, 'When Straus left for the West Coast [in 1948], Einstein was search-\ning for a new assistant. Therefore\nI strongly recommended to Einstein that he not reappoint me but that he get a\nspecialist' [K6]. Assistant to Einstein in 1949-50. von Neumann at The Institute for Advanced Study,\n1947-8.

(In\nMarch 1955, Einstein had recommended an extension of her assistantship to\nJune, 1956 [E74].)\nKaufman was Einstein's last collaborator. She and Einstein wrote two joint\npapers, both dealing with asymmetric connections [E75, E76]. The last collabo-\nrative effort in Einstein's life was completed in January 1955. After Einstein's\ndeath, Kaufman and Kurt Go'del put in order the scientific papers in Einstein's\noffice, Room 115 in Fuld Hall.

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923. Rathenau was murdered just a few\nmonths before Einstein set out for Japan, glad to absent himself for a while from\na potentially dangerous situation.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. In Novem-\nber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein. Next the\nSwiss ambassador had asked for clarification since, to his knowledge, Einstein was\na Swiss citizen. On December 4 he received a telegram from the Prussian Academy:\n'Antwort: Einstein ist Reichsdeutscher.' On December 11 the Foreign Office\ninformed him that Einstein was Swiss. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. The protocol of the Prussian Academy of January 18 quotes\nthe legal opinion that Einstein was a German citizen but that his Swiss citizenship\nwas not thereby invalidated. On February 15 the Prussian Academy informed\nEinstein of this ruling. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El]. The end of the affair came when Baron\nRamel, the Swedish ambassador to Germany, called on Einstein in Berlin and\nhanded him his insignia.\nIn March 1923 Svante Arrhenius, one of the Committee members, wrote to\nEinstein suggesting that the latter not wait until December for his visit to Sweden\nbut that he come in July. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,\nthough he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Some physicists also\nsigned: M. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien). Theoretical physics.)\n1913. Theoretical physics. Lorentz, Nernst, Planck; (Kamerlingh Onnes).)\n1914. Eotvos, Mach,\nPlanck; (von Laue). Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). Theoretical physics. Knudsen, Lehmann, Planck; (Stark; also, 1918\nprize goes to Planck). Mathematical physics. Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). In all three instances, his sole motivation was relativity (until further\nnotice, relativity shall refer to the special theory). In 1910 he wrote that relativity\nwas the most far-reaching new concept since the discovery of the energy principle\n[Ol]. On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E.\nWien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and\nLorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein\nand Lorentz).\nAt issue was the verification of Einstein's relation between the rest mass, the\nenergy, and the velocity of a free electron. As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation. By then, the momentous new development of\ngeneral relativity had drastically changed the situation.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507\nBefore turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions\nof the Committee to the earlier ones. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. 'Lorentz was\nundoubtedly more cautious with his hypotheses than Einstein,' it is noted. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. Einstein was deeply\nimmersed in the struggle with general relativity and was confusing everybody,\nincluding himself, with his hybrid theory in which everything was covariant\nexcept the gravitational field equations. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special\nand general relativity. Haas proposed\nEinstein for the new theory of gravitation, quoting the explanation of the peri-\nhelion precession of Mercury. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\n1919.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. However, it is noted, Einstein's statistical papers are not\nof as high a caliber as his work on relativity and quantum physics. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] .\n1920. Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein. As early as 1917 Einstein had pointed out that Gehrcke's\ntheory is based on contradictory assumptions [E4].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Hadamard (Paris) proposes either Einstein or Perrin. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Eddington writes, 'Einstein\nstands above his contemporaries even as Newton did' [E5].' Also beside\nthe mark is his finding about the general theory: 'As Gullstrand has shown, the\nsituation is that it remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein\ntheory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion experiment [. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nOseen, the theoretical physicist, gives an excellent analysis of Einstein's paper\nof 1905 on the light-quantum as well as of his work in 1909 on energy fluctuations\nin blackbody radiation.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.\nThat is how Einstein got the Nobel prize 'for his services to theoretical physics\nand especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 511\nA further exchange between Gullstrand and Kretschmann settled their differ-\nences to mutual satisfaction [K3].\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was. Einstein's paper\non that subject was the first application of quantum theory to systems other than\npure radiation. The order of awards for quantum\nphysics was perfect: first Planck, then Einstein, then Bohr. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

In September 1918 Einstein received a request from Stockholm\nfor a nomination in physics for the year 1919.\nOn November 13, 1919, Planck is awarded the physics prize for 1918. January 19, 1921. October 26, 1923. In response to another request for a nomination in phys-\nics, Einstein writes that he finds it difficult to make one definite proposal.\n**The references given in [PI] and [P2] occur explicitly in Einstein's letters. Einstein proposes the famous Brazilian explorer Marshal\nCandido Mariano da Silva Rondon for the peace prize. February 15, 1928. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies\nto Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-\nnot decide to intervene in the present case.'\nUpon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a\nletter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-\ninitely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals. Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. I mention here one\nadditional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:\n'The old one had . This is the first of three letters in which Einstein\nfocuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. It is significant that neither\nin 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac. September 20, 1931. Einstein is now convinced that quantum mechanics\nwill survive.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,\nProfessor E. Schroedinger from Berlin and Professor W. Heisenberg from\nLeipzig.\n[Here Einstein adds a footnote: This, however, is only my own opinion, which\nmay be wrong.'\nEinstein's judgment of the relative scientific merits of Schroedinger's and Hei-\nsenberg's work was indeed wrong. No physics prize is awarded in 1931. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the\nEnglishman Herbert Runham Brown. Schroedinger\nfrom Berlin. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'\npeace prize proposals.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem. Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers.\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 517\nhim for the peace prize, initiated in 1934, grew into an international campaign. Einstein writes to Mrs de Haas-Lorentz: 'Together\nwith some local colleagues, I have proposed Otto Stern and [I. Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-\ngang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory\nconsisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of\nmodern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that\ntheory stop Albert Einstein. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. Einstein writes to Dr Alvin Johnson, president emeritus\nof The New School for Social Research in New York City. Einstein writes that he has no insight and\nunderstanding concerning modern literature.\nHe and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein had read his main book,\nThe Death of Virgil, and admired it [Bl]. Einstein proposes Friedrich Wilhelm Forster for the\npeace prize: 'It might be difficult to find people who have actually been successful\nin their efforts to secure peace. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue\nto award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -\nGeiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution.\nIn 1954 Bothe and Born share the physics prize. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.\nIt has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to\nStockholm proposing A.

as the years went by, and my interest in him as an\nhistorical figure grew. The early period, from Einstein's birth in 1879 to the beginning of his\nacademic career as Privatdozent in Bern in February 1908, is discussed in (3),\nwhich contains a sketch of his childhood, his school years (contrary to popular\nbelief he earned high marks in elementary as well as high school), his brief reli-\ngious phase, his student days, his initial difficulties in finding a job, and most of\nthe period he spent at the patent office in Bern, a period that witnesses the death\nof his father, his marriage to Mileva Marie, and the birth of his first son. Following this, (16b) and (16c) are devoted\nto the abrupt emergence in 1919 of Einstein (whose genius had already been fully\nrecognized for some time by his scientific peers) as a charismatic world figure and\nto my views on the causes of this striking phenomenon. The book ends with a detailed\nEinstein chronology (32).\nBefore starting on a similar tour of the scientific part, I interject a few remarks\non Einstein and politics and on Einstein as a philosopher and humanist.) The operator asked for Dr Einstein.\nEinstein was a lover of wisdom.\n**Einstein's cousin Lina Einstein died in Auschwitz.\nIt seems to me that, when in midlife Einstein wrote of 'The wonderful events\nwhich the great Newton experienced in his young days. In that year Einstein produced six papers:\n1.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book.\nLong periods of gestation are a marked characteristic in Einstein's scientific\ndevelopment. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. Einstein, Die Vossische Zeitung, May 23, 1916. \u2014\u2014 in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (P. Margot Einstein, letter to M.", "Light_Quantum_1905": " The conver-\nsation on that occasion soon turned to the quantum theory.)\nThe main topic of discussion, however, was quantum physics. That had not been obvious to me earlier,\nas I belong to the generation which was exposed to 'ready-made' quantum\nmechanics. About\nrelativity he spoke with detachment, about the quantum theory with passion. The\nquantum was his demon. The light-quantum and the photoelectric effect, completed March 17 (19c),\n(19e). The last of\nthese, written in 1904, contains a first reference to the quantum theory. In March he\ncounted molecules in his light-quantum paper (19c). It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum. In fact the light-quantum postulate itself grew out of a statis-\ntical argument concerning the equilibrium properties of radiation (19c). It should\n2O INTRODUCTORY\nalso be remembered that the main applications of his first work (1904) on energy\nfluctuations (4c) are in the quantum domain. His analysis of these fluctuations in\nblackbody radiation led him to become the first to state, in 1909, long before the\ndiscovery of quantum mechanics, that the theory of the future ought to be based\non a dual description in terms of particles and waves (21 a). This inves-\ntigation led him to the momentum properties of light-quanta (21c). His preoccupation with quantum problems, which began shortly\nafter Planck's discovery of the blackbody radiation law late in 1900, bore its first\nfruit in March 1905. Questions that lie at the root of the special theory of relativity\ndawned on him as early as 1895 (6d); the theory saw the light in June 1905. It begins with\nbrief remarks on the nineteenth century concept of the aether (6a), that quaint,\nhypothetical medium which was introduced for the purpose of explaining the\nPURPOSE AND PLAN 21\ntransmission of light waves and which was abolished by Einstein. During the next three and a half years,\nhis attention focuses on that crisis phenomenon, the quantum theory, rather than\non the less urgent problems of relativity (10). It is also necessary to enlarge on the remark made previously concerning the\n24 INTRODUCTORY\nstatistical origins of the light-quantum hypothesis. First, the light-quantum was conceived\nof as a parcel of energy as far as the properties of pure radiation (no coupling to\nmatter) are concerned.\nThe light-quantum, a parcel of energy, slowly evolved into the photon, a parcel\nof energy and momentum (21), a fundamental particle with zero mass and unit\nspin.\nQuantum mechanics was born within a few months of the settling of the photon\nissue. His\nvision of a future interplay of relativity and quantum theory in a unified field\ntheory is the subject of the last scientific chapter of this book (26), in which I\nreturn to the picture drawn in the preface. The synthesis of relativity and the quantum theory is incomplete\n(2). In his first paper on this subject, the light-quantum hypothesis\nis arrived at by a statistical argument. They include his work on specific heats, on particle-wave\nduality, on the particle nature of the light-quantum, on spontaneous and induced\nradiative processes, and on a new derivation of the blackbody radiation formula.\n58 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\n1902-4. Introduction of the light-quantum hypothesis with the help of\nan argument based on Boltzmann statistics [El3]. With this paper, solid\nstate quantum theory begins. Three overlapping but nonidentical papers dealing with sponta-\nneous and induced radiative processes (A and B coefficients), a new derivation of\nthe blackbody radiation law, and the Brownian motion of a molecular gas in equi-\nlibrium with radiation, from which the momentum properties of a light-quantum\nare deduced [E35, E36, E37]. All the principal papers men-\ntioned above that belong to the area of quantum physics will be discussed in Chap-\nters 19 to 24. It was also Einstein who, in 1905, in his paper on the\nlight-quantum hypothesis [E13], gave that equation its only fitting name: Boltz-\nmann's principle. Second, the reasoning was most important for Einstein's work in 1905,\nsince it drew his attention to the volume dependence of thermodynamic quantities,\na dependence which played a crucial role in his formulation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis, which appeared in his very next paper. His light-quantum paper of 1905 [E13] is a prime example. As we shall see later, this equation played a crucial role in\nEinstein's discovery of the light-quantum. Planck, the first quantum physicist, had\nushered in theoretical physics of the twentieth century with a new counting of\ncomplexions which had absolutely no logical foundation whatsoever\u2014but which\ngave him the answer he was looking for. Hence,\no]ENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 75\nwhich became so important in his discovery of the light-quantum. 'I spent ten years of my life testing that\n1905 equation of Einstein's and contrary to all my expectations, I was compelled\nin 1915 to assert its unambiguous verification in spite of its unreasonableness,\nsince it seemed to violate everything we knew about the interference of light' [Ml]. Rather, the physics\ncommunity at large had received the light-quantum hypothesis with disbelief and\nwith skepticism bordering on derision.) By sharp contrast, from 1905 to\n1923, he was a man apart in being the only one, or almost the only one, to take\nthe light-quantum seriously.\n357\n358 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nThe critical reaction to Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis of 1905 is of great\nimportance for an understanding of the early developments in quantum physics.\nBut let me first return to the days of the old quantum theory.\n(a) The Light-Quantum. In 1900 Planck discovered the blackbody radiation\nlaw without using light-quanta. In 1905 Einstein discovered light-quanta without\nusing Planck's law. Chapter 19 is devoted to the light-quantum hypothesis. This Chapter ends with a\ndetailed account of the reasons why the light-quantum paper drew such a negative\nresponse. In 1906 Einstein\ncompleted the first paper on quantum effects in the solid state.\n(c) The Photon. The light-quantum as originally defined was a parcel of\nenergy. The concept of the photon as a particle with definite energy and momen-\ntum emerged only gradually.\nI shall continue the outline of Einstein's contributions to the quantum theory\nin Section 18c. First, however, I should like to take leave of our main character\nfor a brief while in order to comment on the singular role of the photon in the\nhistory of the physics of particles and fields. Particle Physics: The First Fifty Years\nLet us leave aside the photon for a while and ask how physicists reacted to the\nexperimental discovery or the theoretical prediction (whichever came first) of other\nnew particles.\nAnd then there was the photon, the first particle to be predicted theoretically. The Quantum Theory: Lines of Influence\nThe skeleton diagram below is an attempt to reduce the history of the quantum\ntheory to its barest outlines. It ended with the\ndetailed experimental vindication of the photon concept, to which Bohr fully sub-\nscribed from then on.9\nThe Light - Quantum\n19a. The response to Kirchhoff's\nchallenge led to the discovery of the quantum theory.1)\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 365\na simple form, as do all functions which do not depend on the properties of indi-\nvidual bodies and which one has become acquainted with before now' [K2]. These experimental developments\nare of fundamental importance for our main subject, the quantum theory, since\nthey were crucial to the discovery of the blackbody radiation law.366 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n(19.5)\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM367\nSample of the Rubens-Kurlbaum data which led Planck to guess his radiation formula\n[Rl].)\n368 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nbeen concluded . However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life.6 contains Wien's law of 1896:\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 369\nEven if Planck had stopped after October 19, he would forever be remembered\nas the discoverer of the radiation law. That made him the discoverer of\nthe quantum theory. Now comes the\nquantum postulate. And that is how the quantum theory was born. As will be discussed in Section 19b, the classical\nequipartition theorem could have given him a quite definite method for determin-\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 37.\n372 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ndetermination of e, J., the quantum theory] set sci-\nence a fresh task: that of finding a new conceptual basis for all of physics.\nLet us now return to the beginnings of the quantum theory. Nothing further\nhappened in quantum physics after 1901 until Einstein proposed the light-quan-\ntum hypothesis. Einstein on Planck: 1905.\nThe Rayleigh-Einstein-Jeans Law\nThe first sentence on the quantum theory published by Einstein was written in\nthe month of March, in the year 1905. It is the title of his first paper on light-\nquanta, 'On a heuristic point of view concerning the generation and conversion of\nlight' [E5, Al].\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 373\nlater. It also deals with the quantum theory. Whatever one may think of the\nstatus of the quantum theory in 1955, in 1905 this opinion was, of course, entirely\njustified.\nIn July 1905 Rayleigh acknowledges Jeans' contribution [R6].** In order to suppress the catastrophic high frequency behavior, he intro-\nduces next an ad hoc exponential cutoff factor and proposes the overall radiation\nlaw\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 375\na few, that a crisis in physics was at hand [E6]. He was also on his way from statistical\nphysics to quantum physics.\nEinstein derived the above value for N in the light-quantum paper, completed\nin March 1905.\nWe now leave the classical part of the March paper and turn to its quantum\npart.\n376 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n19c. The Light-Quantum Hypothesis and the Heuristic Principle\nI mentioned in Chapter 3 that the March paper was Einstein's only contribution\nthat he himself called revolutionary. He extracted the light-quantum postulate\nfrom an analogy between radiation in the Wien regime and a classical ideal gas\nof material particles.20 and we have Einstein's\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 377\nLight-quantum hypothesis: Monochromatic radiation of low density [i.\nThe genius of the light-quantum hypothesis lies in the intuition for choosing the\nright piece of experimental input and the right, utterly simple, theoretical ingre-\ndients.\nEinstein's introduction of light-quanta in the Wien regime is the first step\ntoward the concept of radiation as a Bose gas of photons. The physicist of 1905 could take or leave the\nlight-quantum hypothesis as nothing more than a curious property of pure radia-\ntion in thermal equilibrium, without any physical consequence.\n378 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIn other words, the light-quantum hypothesis is an assertion about a quantum\nproperty of free electromagnetic radiation; the heuristic principle is an extension\nof these properties of light to the interaction between light and matter.

Einstein had introduced a quantization related to p: the light-quantum hypoth-\nesis.11 even though its theoretical foundation had become a mystery\nwhen quantum effects are important.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves. Thus Hertz, the first to observe a photo-\nelectric phenomenon (if we consider only the so-called external photoelectric\neffect), made this discovery at about the same time he demonstrated the electro-\nmagnetic nature of light. He made the crucial discovery that the electron energy showed 'not the\nslightest dependence on the light intensity' [L5].\n1905: Einstein.

I turn next to a\nmore systematic review of the responses to the light-quantum idea. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next. His struggles with the quantum theory in general and\nwith the light-quantum hypothesis in particular are a recurring theme.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. This led him to approach quantum problems with great cau-\ntion in his writings\u2014a caution already evident in the way the title of his March\npaper was phrased. Also,\n*A11 these fifty years of pondering have not brought me any closer to answering the question, What\nare light quanta.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 383\nhe had used this law as an experimental fact without explaining it. He did\nthis very clearly in 1911, at the first Solvay congress, where he said, 'I insist on\nthe provisional character of this concept [light-quanta] which does not seem recon-\ncilable with the experimentally verified consequences of the wave theory' [El2].\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory.\nFirst, a general remark on the old quantum theory. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. In 1907 he wrote to\nEinstein:\nI am not seeking the meaning of the quantum of action [light-quanta] in the\nvacuum but rather in places where absorption and emission occur, and [I]\nassume that what happens in the vacuum is rigorously described by Maxwell's\nequations. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9].\nThus by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, many leading\ntheorists were prepared to accept the fact that the quantum theory was here to\nstay. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2].\nI have already mentioned that Millikan relished his result on the photoeffect\nbut declared that, even so, the light quantum theory 'seems untenable' [M5]. The fact of the matter is that, even after Ein-\nstein's photoelectric law was accepted, almost no one but Einstein himself would\nhave anything to do with light-quanta.\nTo summarize: the enormous resistance to light-quanta found its roots in the\nparticle-wave paradoxes. Moreover, experimental support was\nlong in coming and, even after the photoelectric effect predictions were verified,\nlight-quanta were still largely considered unacceptable. Einstein's own emphasis\non the provisional nature of the light-quantum hypothesis tended to strengthen\nthe reservations held by other physicists.\nHe did not return to the light-quantum until 1909. We shall return to the light-quantum\nin Chapter 21.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 387\nE8.\n388 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nP7.", "Light_Quantum_1901": " However, in his personal and scientific conduct, he was not a\nrebel, one who resists authority, nor\u2014except once*\u2014a revolutionary, one who\n'Einstein's one truly revolutionary contribution is his light-quantum paper of 1905.

By current theory, he meant, of course, the\nclassical wave theory of light. The former corresponds to Wien's law, which in turn holds in the regime\nin which Einstein had introduced the light-quantum postulate.' His vision of light-quanta as particles is especially evident in a\nletter to Sommerfeld, also dating from 1909, in which he writes of 'the ordering\nof the energy of light around discrete points which move with light velocity' [E4]. 2)404 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEquation 21.

Light-Quantum and Photon. A photon is a state of the electromagnetic field\nwith the following properties. I shall return to the nonconservation of photon number in Chapter 23, but\nwould like to note here an ironic twist of history. The term photon first appeared\nin the title of a paper written in 1926: 'The Conservation of Photons. The subject: a\nspeculation that light consists of 'a new kind of atom . propose the name photon' [L2].\n408 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nOctober 1927 the fifth Solvay conference was held. Its subject was 'electrons et\nphotons.'\nWhen Einstein introduced light-quanta in 1905, these were energy quanta sat-\nisfying Eq. For this reason, in this section I make the distinction between\nlight-quantum ('E \u2014 hv only') and photon. The dissymmetry between energy and\nmomentum in the 1905 paper is, of course, intimately connected with the origins\nof the light-quantum postulate in equilibrium statistical mechanics. It was via the analysis of statistical fluctuations of blackbody radiation\nthat Einstein eventually came to associate a definite momentum with a light-quan-\ntum. Einstein's first results bearing on the\nquestion of photon momentum are found in the two 1909 papers.\nTHE PHOTON 409\nThe parallels between Eqs.17 would lead Einstein to\nstate, in 1909, the 'momentum quantum postulate': monochromatic radiation of\nlow density behaves in regard to pressure fluctuations as if it consists of mutually\nindependent momentum quanta of magnitude hv/' c.\nWhat he did say was, 'If the radiation were to consist of very few extended\ncomplexes with energy hv which move independently through space and which\nare independently reflected\u2014a picture that represents the roughest visualization\nof the light-quantum hypothesis\u2014then as a consequence of fluctuations in the\nradiation pressure there would act on our plate only such momenta as are repre-\nsented by the first term of our formula [Eq. It seems fair to paraphrase this statement as follows: light-quanta may well\nbe particles in the same sense that electrons are particles.\nThe photon momentum made its explicit appearance in that same year, 1909. Einstein himself did not explicitly intro-\nduce photon momentum until 1916, in the course of his studies on thermal equi-\nlibrium between electromagnetic radiation and a molecular gas [E10, Ell].18)\n410 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nTechnically, the following issue arises. Indeed, if we leave aside the question of spin,\nwe may say that Einstein abstracted not only the light-quantum but also the more\ngeneral photon concept entirely from statistical mechanical considerations. Earliest Unbehagen about Chance\nEinstein prefaced his statement about photon momentum just quoted with the\nremark that this conclusion can be considered 'als ziemlich sicher erwiesen,' as\nfairly certainly proven.\nTHE PHOTON 411\nBesso about the needle rays, he wrote, 'Damit sind die Lichtquanten so gut wie\ngesichert' [E13].\nOn the other hand, at about the same time that Einstein lost any remaining\ndoubts about the existence of light-quanta, we also encounter the first expressions\nof his Unbehagen, his discomfort with the theoretical implications of the new\nquantum concepts in regard to 'Zufall,' chance.16] make it seem\nalmost inevitable to formulate a truly quantized theory of radiation.\n412 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nunderstood as yet' [E15]. One\nfurther example may show how from 1917 on he could not make his peace with\nthe quantum theory. An Aside: Quantum Conditions for Nonseparable Classical Motion\nIn May 1917, shortly after Einstein finished his triple of papers on the quantum\ntheory of radiation, he wrote an article on the restrictions imposed by the 'old'\nquantum theory on classically allowed orbits in phase space [El7], to which he\nadded a brief mathematical sequel a few months later [E18]. However,\nrecently the importance and the pioneering character of this work has been rec-\nognized by mathematicians, quantum physicists, and quantum chemists. The only\nlogic for mentioning this work at this particular place is that it fits with the time\nsequence of Einstein's contributions to quantum physics. The Compton Effect\nI return to the photon story and come to its denouement. Even those opposed to quantized radiation might\nhave found these relations to their liking since (independent of any quantum\ndynamics) they yield at once significant differences from the classical theories of\nthe scattering of light by matter** and therefore provide simple tests of the photon\nidea.THE PHOTON 413\nit is not surprising that he would look for new ways in which the existence of\nphotons might lead to observable deviations from the classical picture. At one point, in 1921, he thought he had found a new quantum\ncriterion [E19], but it soon turned out to be a false lead [E20, Kl]. In fact, after\n1917 nothing particularly memorable happened in regard to light-quanta until\ncapital progress was achieved* when Arthur Compton [Cl] and Debye [D2]\nindependently derived the relativistic kinematics for the scattering of a photon off\nan electron at rest:\n(21.20)\n414 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nwithin the error. Nevertheless, the photon idea was rapidly accepted. In the same article he also wrote, 'There are therefore now two theories\nof light, both indispensable, and\u2014as one must admit today despite twenty years\nof tremendous effort on the part of theoretical physicists\u2014without any logical\nconnection.\n**The work of Compton and Debye led Pauli to extend Einstein's work of 1917 to the case of\nradiation in equilibrium with free electrons [P3].\nTHE PHOTON 415\nEl.", "Quantum_Theory_1924": "\nHelen Dukas\nIn January 1924, Niels Bohr, Hendrik Anton Kramers, and John Clarke Slater\nsubmitted to the Philosophical Magazine an article [Bl] that contained drastic\ntheoretical proposals concerning the interaction of light and matter. When he was\nnearly seventy, he wrote 'That this insecure and contradictory foundation [of\nphysics in the years from 1910 to 1920] was sufficient to enable a man of Bohr's\nunique instinct and tact to discover the major laws of the spectral lines and of the\nelectron shells of the atoms together with their significance for chemistry appeared\nto me like a miracle\u2014and appears to me as a miracle even today.\nAs already stressed in Section 19f, it was the position of most theoretical phys-\nicists during the first decades of the quantum era that the conventional continuous\ndescription of the free radiation field should be protected at all cost and that the\nquantum puzzles concerning radiation should eventually be resolved by a revision\n'This was presumably the text of Bohr's contribution to the third Solvay conference (April 1921).\n418 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nof the properties of interaction between radiation and matter.* This program was not to be the right way out of the difficulties of the old\nquantum theory, yet the paper had a lasting impact in that (as we shall see) it\nstimulated important experimental developments.

The\nBKS theory, with its rejection of photons and its insistence on the continuous pic-\nture of light at the price of nonconservation, historically represents the last stand\nof the old quantum theory. For very good reasons, this proposal was characterized\nsome years later by one of the principal architects of quantum mechanics as rep-\nresenting the height of the crisis in the old quantum theory [HI]. They associated with an atom in a given state a 'virtual\nradiation field' that contains all the possible transition frequencies to other sta-\ntionary states and assumed that 'the transitions which in [the Einstein theory of\n1917] are designated as spontaneous are, in our view, induced [my italics] by the\nvirtual field. In a paper completed later in 1924, Slater [S2] noted that\nthe theory 'has unattractive features .'\n420 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nequations do hold in the average and the experiment on AX refers only to the\naverage change of the wavelength. He was now\nprepared for an even more drastic resolution of the quantum paradoxes. In July\n1925 he wrote, 'One must be prepared for the fact that the required generalization\nof the classical electrodynamic theory demands a profound revolution in the con-\ncepts on which the description of nature has until now been founded' [B4].\nThese remarks by Bohr end with references to de Broglie's thesis and also to\nEinstein's work on the quantum gas (the subject of the next chapter): the profound\nrevolution had begun.

That had not been obvious to me earlier,\nas I belong to the generation which was exposed to 'ready-made' quantum\nmechanics. In all the years I knew\nEinstein, I never read any of his papers, on the simple grounds that I already\nknew what to a physicist was memorable in them and did not need to know what\nhad been superseded. Following this, (16b) and (16c) are devoted\nto the abrupt emergence in 1919 of Einstein (whose genius had already been fully\nrecognized for some time by his scientific peers) as a charismatic world figure and\nto my views on the causes of this striking phenomenon.) The operator asked for Dr Einstein.\nThe men whom Einstein at one time or another acknowledged as his precursors\nwere Newton, Maxwell, Mach, Planck, and Lorentz.' [E8], he described his own ideals, the desire for ful-\nfillment not just as a theorist but also as an experimental physicist. On the occasion of the\nbicentenary of Newton's death, Einstein wrote to the secretary of the Royal Soci-\nety, 'All who share humbly in pondering over the secrets of physical events are\nwith you in spirit, and join in the admiration and love that bind us to Newton',\nthen went on to comment on the evolution of physics since Newton's day and\nconcluded as follows:\nIt is only in the quantum theory that Newton's differential method becomes\ninadequate, and indeed strict causality fails us. Of\ncourse, this opinion, held by modern physicists, has not prevented them from rec-\nognizing Einstein as by far the most important scientific figure of this century.\nI now turn to a tour of Einstein's science. No one was ever awarded a\nPhD degree working with him, but he was always fond of discussing physics prob-\nlems, whether with colleagues his age or with people much younger. But,\nof course, theoretical physics was his main devotion.\nThere is no better way to begin this brief survey of his theoretical work than\nwith a first look at what he did in 1905. In that year Einstein produced six papers:\n1. The first paper on special relativity, received* June 30. None of\nthese first five papers left much of a mark on physics, but I believe they were very\nimportant warming-up exercises in Einstein's own development.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book. In (5a), there is an introductory sketch of the\nnineteenth century status of this question. During that period the chemist, member\nof the youngest branch of science, argued the question in one context, the physicist\nin another, and each paid little attention to what the other was saying. Three of these methods are found in Einstein's work of 1905. The confluence of all these answers is the result of important late nineteenth-\ncentury developments in experimental physics. The great masters of the nineteenth century\u2014Maxwell, Boltz-\nmann, Kelvin, van der Waals, and others\u2014did not, of course, sit and wait for the\nmolecular hypothesis to be proved before broaching problem number two. It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum. It should\n2O INTRODUCTORY\nalso be remembered that the main applications of his first work (1904) on energy\nfluctuations (4c) are in the quantum domain. His analysis of these fluctuations in\nblackbody radiation led him to become the first to state, in 1909, long before the\ndiscovery of quantum mechanics, that the theory of the future ought to be based\non a dual description in terms of particles and waves (21 a).\nEinstein's active involvement with statistical physics began in 1902 and lasted\nuntil 1925, when he made his last major contribution to physics: his treatment of\nthe quantum statistics of molecules (23). His preoccupation with quantum problems, which began shortly\nafter Planck's discovery of the blackbody radiation law late in 1900, bore its first\nfruit in March 1905. Questions that lie at the root of the special theory of relativity\ndawned on him as early as 1895 (6d); the theory saw the light in June 1905. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. Lorentz, founder of the theory of electrons,\ncodiscoverer of the Lorentz contraction (as Poincare named it), interpreter of the\nZeeman effect, acknowledged by Einstein as his precursor, wrote down the Lor-\nentz transformations (so named by Poincare) in 1904. In 1898, Poincare, one of the greatest mathematicians of his day and a\nconsummate mathematical physicist, had written that we have no direct intuition\nof the simultaneity of events occurring in two different places, a remark almost\ncertainly known to Einstein before 1905 (6b). In 1905 Einstein and Poincare\nstated independently and almost simultaneously (within a matter of weeks) the\ngroup properties of the Lorentz transformations and the addition theorem of veloc-\nities.\nSpecial relativity brought clarity to old physics and created new physics, in par-\nticular Einstein's derivation (also in 1905) of the relation E = me2 (7b). During the next three and a half years,\nhis attention focuses on that crisis phenomenon, the quantum theory, rather than\non the less urgent problems of relativity (10). I must add that, late in 1906, Einstein became the founder of the quantum\ntheory of the solid state by giving the essentially correct explanation of the anom-\nalous behavior of hard solids, such as diamond, for example, at low temperatures\n(20). Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. That, I believe, was Einstein's one revolutionary contribution to physics\n(2). His\nvision of a future interplay of relativity and quantum theory in a unified field\ntheory is the subject of the last scientific chapter of this book (26), in which I\nreturn to the picture drawn in the preface. General comments on relativity and quantum theory come\nnext, followed by a sketch of Einstein's early years. Sci.

Relativity's Aesthetic Origins.\nThe special theory of relativity divested the aether of its principal mechanical\nproperty, absolute rest, and thereby made the aether redundant. As Einstein put\nit in the introduction to his June 1905 paper (referred to in this chapter as the\nJune paper), 'the introduction of a \"light-aether\" will prove to be superfluous\nsince, according to the view to be developed [here], neither will a \"space in abso-\nlute rest\" endowed with special properties be introduced nor will a velocity vector\nbe associated with a point of empty space in which electromagnetic processes take\nplace' [El].* Special relativity represents the abandonment of mechanical pictures\nas an aid to the interpretation of electromagnetism. The preference for uniformity of relative\nmotion makes this version of relativity a special one.\nIn the spring of 1905, even before the completion of the relativity paper, Ein-\nstein had written to his friend Conrad Habicht, 'The fourth work [i., El, the\nfourth paper Einstein published in 1905] is available only in draft form and is an\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies in which use is made of a modification of the\ntenets about space and time; the purely kinematic part of this work will surely\ninterest you' [E2]. The kinematic part contains the complete first\nprinciples of the special relativity theory.\n138\nTHE NEW KINEMATICS 139\nAs indicated in Chapter 6, special relativity was born after a decade of gestation. All the more, it\nshowed to us the relations of the so-called invariance of the velocity of light that\nthose equations should hold also in the moving frame of reference. This invariance\nof the velocity of light was, however, in conflict with the rule of addition of veloc-\nities we knew of well in mechanics. I had wasted time almost a year in fruitless considerations, with\na hope of some modification of Lorentz's idea, and at the same time I could not\nbut realize that it was a puzzle not easy to solve at all.\" My solution was really for the very concept of time, that is, that\ntime is not absolutely defined but there is an inseparable connection between time\nand the signal velocity. Five weeks after my recognition of this, the present\ntheory of special relativity was completed. As to the completion of the work\nin five weeks, since the paper was received by the Annalen der Physik on June\n30, Einstein's total concentration on relativity followed immediately upon the\nrelief of his having finished three major projects in statistical physics: the paper\non the light-quantum, his thesis, and the paper on Brownian motion, completed\non March 17, April 30, and around May 10, respectively.\nIn 1905 Einstein's belief in 'the truth of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations' was\nnot unqualified, as we shall see later. It was strong enough, however, for him to\nperceive the conflict between the constancy of the velocity of light (in the vacuum)\n140 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nand the relativity principle of classical mechanics.\nWhat is so captivating about the Einstein of 1905 is the apparent ease and the\nfraicheur with which he introduces new ideas.\n142 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nB's, and B's with that of a third observer C, then A's is synchronous with C's. Einstein's example: two identical rods R, and R2\nare coincident in a given inertial frame in which two observers O, and O2 have\nsynchronized their respective clocks.

The postulates together with these prescriptions fully specify Einstein's\ntheory of special relativity. From the Postulates to the Lorentz Transformations.\nEinstein obtained this relation by deriving the Lorentz transformation from his\npostulates.8 in the discussion of papers by Lorentz\nand Poincare.8 with a velocity v given by\nTwenty years later, Einstein heard something about the Lorentz group that\ngreatly surprised him.

The honor of the first derivation (in 1907) goes\nto Max von Laue, who pointed out that 'according to the relativity principle,\nlight is completely dragged along by the body [i.13 by means of\na dynamic calculation that does not explicitly involve relativity [P5].\ng) Einstein rather casually mentioned that if two synchronous clocks G, and C2\nare at the same initial position and if C2 leaves A and moves along a closed\norbit, then upon return to A, C2 will run slow relative to C,, as often observed\nsince in the laboratory.8), he found that in a frame with velocity\nv in the x direction:\n* Hertz, Planck, and Poincare did likewise.

Also, he rightly regarded his own quantum\nhypotheses of 1905 more of a new phenomenological description than a new the-\nory, in sharp contrast to his relativity theory, which he rightly regarded as a true\ntheory with clearly defined first principles.\nNot just in 1905 but throughout his life Einstein considered quantum theory as\na preliminary to a true theory and relativity as the royal road toward such a the-\nory.\n148 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\n7b.

During the winter semester of 1905-6, Planck pre-\nsented Einstein's theory in the physics colloquium in Berlin. As a result von Laue became another early\nconvert to relativity, published in 1907 the pretty note [LI] on the Fizeau exper-\niment, did more good work on the special theory, and became the author of the\nfirst monograph on special relativity [L4]. The\nfirst PhD thesis on relativity was completed under his direction [M3].\nThe first paper bearing on relativity but published by someone other than Ein-\nstein was by Planck [P6], as best I know.\nAmong other early papers on relativity, I mention one by Ehrenfest in 1907\n[El7], in which is asked for the first time the important question: How does one\napply Lorentz transformations to a rigid body.\nThe publication of the 1905 papers on special relativity marked the beginning\nof the end of Einstein's splendid isolation at the patent office. 'The young man who met me made such\nan unexpected impression on me that I could not believe he could be the father of\nthe relativity theory,' von Laue later recalled [S2]. Yet in these early years the relativists were few in\nnumber.\nThen, in 1908, came the 'space and time' lecture of Herman Minkowski. In\n1902, Minkowski, at one time Einstein's teacher in Zurich, had moved to the\nUniversity of Goettingen. There, on November 5, 1907, he gave a colloquium\nabout relativity in which he identified Lorentz transformations with pseudorota-\ntions for which\n152 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nwhere xl} x2, x3 denote the spatial variables.\nThus began the enormous formal simplification of special relativity.\nMinkowski's semitechnical report on these matters, the 'space and time' lecture\ngiven in Cologne in 1908, began with these words:** 'The views of space and time\nwhich I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics,\nand therein lies their strength.\nThe rapid growth of Einstein's reputation in scientific circles dates from about\n1908.

The analogy to which Lorentz referred\nwas first noted by J.\nSuch was the situation when in 1904 Lorentz proposed a new model: the elec-\ntron at rest is again a little sphere, but it is subject to the FitzGerald-Lorentz\ncontraction [L9].

As I shall discuss in (27), the answer has to do with a grand\ndesign which Einstein conceived early, before the discovery of quantum mechanics,\nfor a synthetic physical theory. It was to be a theory of particles and fields in\nwhich general relativity and quantum theory would be synthesized.\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 33\ngroup.", "Quantum_Mechanics_1905": " Rather, we\nwere discussing the quantum theory, in particular what is doable and knowable\nin the sense of physical observation. The twentieth century physicist does not, of\ncourse, claim to have the definitive answer to this question.\nTo make that question more precise, it is necessary to understand Einstein's\ncredo in regard not just to quantum physics but to all of physics. Only many\nyears after Einstein's death did I see the beginnings of an answer when I realized\n5\n6 INTRODUCTORY\nthat, nearly a decade before the discovery of modern quantum mechanics, he had\nbeen the first to understand that the nineteenth century ideal of causality was\nabout to become a grave issue in quantum physics. I failed to see the relevance of such remarks as that\nSchroedinger was completely shocked in 1927 when he was told of the probability\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics or a reference to some objection by Einstein\nin 1928, which apparently had no bearing whatever on the subject at hand. The conver-\nsation on that occasion soon turned to the quantum theory.)\nThe main topic of discussion, however, was quantum physics. Time and time again, the\nargument would turn to quantum mechanics and its interpretation. That had not been obvious to me earlier,\nas I belong to the generation which was exposed to 'ready-made' quantum\nmechanics. About\nrelativity he spoke with detachment, about the quantum theory with passion. The\nquantum was his demon. At the same\ntime he is a pioneer, as first Planck, then he, then Bohr founded a new physics\nwithout precursors\u2014the quantum theory. The last of\nthese, written in 1904, contains a first reference to the quantum theory.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book. In March he\ncounted molecules in his light-quantum paper (19c). The confluence of all these answers is the result of important late nineteenth-\ncentury developments in experimental physics.\nNevertheless, Einstein's preoccupation with the fundamental questions of sta-\ntistical mechanics was extremely vital since it led to his most important contri-\nbutions to the quantum theory. It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum. It should\n2O INTRODUCTORY\nalso be remembered that the main applications of his first work (1904) on energy\nfluctuations (4c) are in the quantum domain. His analysis of these fluctuations in\nblackbody radiation led him to become the first to state, in 1909, long before the\ndiscovery of quantum mechanics, that the theory of the future ought to be based\non a dual description in terms of particles and waves (21 a). Another link between\nstatistical mechanics and the quantum theory was forged by his study of the\nBrownian motion of molecules in a bath of electromagnetic radiation.\nEinstein's active involvement with statistical physics began in 1902 and lasted\nuntil 1925, when he made his last major contribution to physics: his treatment of\nthe quantum statistics of molecules (23). The links between the contributions of Einstein, de\nBroglie, and Schroedinger, discussed in (24), make clear that wave mechanics has\nits roots in statistical mechanics\u2014unlike matrix mechanics, where the connections\nbetween the work of Bohr, Heisenberg, and Dirac followed in the first instance\nfrom studies of the dynamics of atoms (18c). His preoccupation with quantum problems, which began shortly\nafter Planck's discovery of the blackbody radiation law late in 1900, bore its first\nfruit in March 1905. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. In the quantum theory, Planck\nstarted before Einstein. During the next three and a half years,\nhis attention focuses on that crisis phenomenon, the quantum theory, rather than\non the less urgent problems of relativity (10).\nIn concluding this tour, I return to Einstein's contributions to the quantum\ntheory. I must add that, late in 1906, Einstein became the founder of the quantum\ntheory of the solid state by giving the essentially correct explanation of the anom-\nalous behavior of hard solids, such as diamond, for example, at low temperatures\n(20). It is also necessary to enlarge on the remark made previously concerning the\n24 INTRODUCTORY\nstatistical origins of the light-quantum hypothesis. Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. First, the light-quantum was conceived\nof as a parcel of energy as far as the properties of pure radiation (no coupling to\nmatter) are concerned.\nThe light-quantum, a parcel of energy, slowly evolved into the photon, a parcel\nof energy and momentum (21), a fundamental particle with zero mass and unit\nspin.\nQuantum mechanics was born within a few months of the settling of the photon\nissue. His\ninitial belief that quantum mechanics contained logical inconsistencies (25a) did\nnot last long. Thereafter, he became convinced that quantum mechanics is an\nincomplete description of nature (25c). Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the\nnonrelativistic version of quantum mechanics did constitute a major advance. The synthesis of relativity and the quantum theory is incomplete\n(2). Orderly Transitions and Revolutionary Periods\nIn all the history of physics, there has never been a period of transition as abrupt,\nas unanticipated, and over as wide a front as the decade 1895 to 1905.

As one of the architects of the pre-1925\nquantum theory, the \"old\" quantum theory, Einstein had quickly found both\nenthusiastic and powerful support for one of his two major contributions to this\nfield: the quantum theory of specific heat.) By sharp contrast, from 1905 to\n1923, he was a man apart in being the only one, or almost the only one, to take\nthe light-quantum seriously.\n357\n358 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nThe critical reaction to Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis of 1905 is of great\nimportance for an understanding of the early developments in quantum physics. In regard to the quantum theory,\nhowever, Einstein almost constantly stood apart, from 1905 until his death. During the second period, from 1926 until the end of his life, he was the\nonly one, or again nearly the only one, to maintain a profoundly skeptical attitude\ntoward quantum mechanics. It is true that\nhe was forever critical of quantum mechanics, but at the same time he had his\nown alternative program for a synthetic theory in which particles, fields, and\nquantum phenomena all would find their place. Einstein pursued this program\nfrom about 1920 (before the discovery of quantum mechanics.\nBut let me first return to the days of the old quantum theory.\n(a) The Light-Quantum. In 1905 Einstein discovered light-quanta without\nusing Planck's law. Chapter 19 is devoted to the light-quantum hypothesis. This Chapter ends with a\ndetailed account of the reasons why the light-quantum paper drew such a negative\nresponse. In 1906 Einstein\ncompleted the first paper on quantum effects in the solid state. The light-quantum as originally defined was a parcel of\nenergy.\n(d) Einstein's work on quantum statistics is treated in Chapter 23, which also\nincludes a discussion of Bose's contribution.\nI shall continue the outline of Einstein's contributions to the quantum theory\nin Section 18c. Particle Physics: The First Fifty Years\nLet us leave aside the photon for a while and ask how physicists reacted to the\nexperimental discovery or the theoretical prediction (whichever came first) of other\nnew particles.\n360 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIn the first instance, this finding led to the abandonment of the earlier qualitative\nconcept of the indivisibility of the atom, but it did not require, or at least not at\nonce, a modification of the established corpus of theoretical physics. During that period, one participant expressed fear for 'a new crisis in quan-\ntum physics'[Wl]. The Quantum Theory: Lines of Influence\nThe skeleton diagram below is an attempt to reduce the history of the quantum\ntheory to its barest outlines.\nIf Planck, Einstein, and Bohr are the fathers of the quantum theory, then Gus-\ntav Robert Kirchhoff is its grandfather.\nFrom Balmer we move to Bohr, the founder of atomic quantum dynamics.\nThe h marking the arrow from Planck to Bohr serves as a reminder that not\n362 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nThe quantum theory: Lines of influence. Their far more important debate on the foundations of\nquantum mechanics began in 1927.\nThis debate will be one of the themes of Chapter 25, which deals with Einstein's\nobjections to quantum mechanics.\nSo it was in the case of quantum mechanics. Among these, there is one that was most dear to\nEinstein and with which he (and all of us to date) struggled in vain: the synthesis\nof quantum physics with general relativity. Weyl, The theory of groups and quantum mechanics (2nd edn.", "Quantum_Mechanics_1926": "25\nEinstein's Response\nto the New Dynamics\nEveryone familiar with modern physics knows that Einstein's attitude regarding\nquantum mechanics was one of skepticism. In fact, even in the search for a unified theory,\nthe quantum riddles were very much on his mind, as I shall discuss in Chapter\n26. In the present chapter, I shall describe how Einstein's position concerning\nquantum mechanics evolved in the course of time.\nTo begin with, I turn to the period 1925-31, during which he was much con-\ncerned with the question, Is quantum mechanics consistent. 1925-31: The Debate Begins\nSchroedinger was not the only one who had profited from the study of Einstein's\nthree papers on the new gas theory. 'Einstein, though in a\nway he was fond of [this idea], never published it' [Wl] since his idea of one field\nper particle was incompatible with strict energy-momentum conservation\u2014a dif-\nficulty which was overcome when Schroedinger introduced one guiding field, the\nSchroedinger wave function, for joint particle configurations. During the very early days of quantum mechanics,*\nwe find him 'working strenuously on the further development of a theory on the\nconnection between gravitation and electricity' [E3]. Yet the great importance of\nthe new developments in quantum theory was not lost on him. Bose, who visited\nBerlin in November 1925, recalled that 'Einstein was very excited about the ne\nquantum mechanics. Some years later, however, he\nwrote admiringly of 'Dirac, to whom, in my opinion, we owe the most logically\nperfect presentation of [quantum mechanics]' [E6]. Einstein's deep interest in quantum mechanics\nmust have led him to write to Heisenberg soon after the publication of the latter's\npaper [H2]. (dated November 30, 1925) is clearly in response to an earlier letter from Einstein\nto Heisenberg in which Einstein appears to have commented on the new quantum\nmechanics. The other is your light-quantum theory, and we have\nthe hope that the validity of the energy and momentum laws in our quantum\nmechanics will one day make possible the connection with your theory' [H4]. No such connection exists, of\n'Recall that Heisenberg's first paper on this subject was completed in July 1925, Schroedinger's in\nJanuary 1926.\n442 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ncourse. Could Einstein have surmised as early as 1925 that some statistical element\nis inherent in the quantum mechanical description. In view of the scientific links between Einstein's and Schroe-\ndinger's work, it is not surprising that Einstein would express real enthusiasm\nabout wave mechanics: 'Schroedinger has come out with a pair of wonderful\npapers on the quantum rules', he wrote in May 1926 [E10]. It was the last time\nhe would write approvingly about quantum mechanics.\nNearly a year passed after Heisenberg's paper before there was a first clarifi-\ncation of the conceptual basis of quantum mechanics.

[B3]*\nOnce more, but now for the last time, we encounter Einstein as a transitional\nfigure in the period of the birth of quantum mechanics. Several leading physicists found it\nhard if not impossible to swallow the abandonment of causality in the classical\nsense, among them Schroedinger. His earliest expressions of lasting dissent I know of date from December\n1926 and are, in fact, contained in his reply to one of Bern's letters: 'Quantum\nmechanics is very impressive. In a lecture given in Berlin, Einstein is reported to have said\nthat 'what nature demands from us is not a quantum theory or a wave theory;\nrather, nature demands from us a synthesis of these two views which thus far has\nexceeded the mental powers of physicists' [El2].\n** Schroedinger retained reservations on the interpretation of quantum mechanics for the rest of his\nlife [SI].\n444 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nas 1909 Einstein had been the first to stress the need for incorporating a particle-\nwave duality in the foundations of physical theory (see Section 2la).') In June 1927 Heisenberg writes a letter to Einstein which\nbegins, 'Many cordial thanks for your kind letter; although I really do not know\nanything new, I would nevertheless like to write once more why I believe that\nindeterminism, that is, the nonvalidity of rigorous causality, is necessary [his ital-\nics] and not just consistently possible' [H7]. In fact, at just about\nthat time, he was doing his own research on quantum mechanics (his first, I\nbelieve). All the founders of the\nquantum theory were there, from Planck, Einstein, and Bohr to de Broglie, Hei-\nsenberg, Schroedinger, and Dirac. As was mentioned in\nChapter 23, Einstein had declined an invitation to give a paper on quantum sta-\ntistics at that conference.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 445\nEinstein came down to breakfast and expressed his misgivings about the new\nquantum theory, every time [he] had invented some beautiful experiment from\nwhich one saw that [the theory] did not work.\nQuantum mechanics provides the following answer to Einstein's query. By\n1931 his position on quantum mechanics had undergone a marked change.\nFirst of all, his next paper on quantum mechanics [El 5], submitted in February\n1931, shows that he had accepted Bohr's criticism. In his movitation, he said about quantum mechanics, 'Diese Lehre enthalt\nnach meiner Uberzeugung ohne Zweifel ein Stuck endgiiltiger Wahrheit. In addition, they\nshow most clearly his thoughts: he came to accept that quantum mechanics was\nnot an aberration but rather a truly professional contribution to physics.' Einstein had\nalready proposed Heisenberg and Schroedinger in 1928, and proposed Schroedinger again in 1932\n(see Chapter 31).\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 449\nNot that from then on he desisted from criticizing quantum mechanics. From 1931 on, the issue for him was no\nlonger the consistency of quantum mechanics but rather its completeness.\nDuring the last twenty-five years of life, Einstein maintained that quantum\nmechanics was incomplete. He no longer believed that quantum mechanics was\nwrong but did believe that the common view of the physics community was wrong\nin ascribing to the postulates of quantum mechanics a degree of finality that he\nheld to be naive and unjustified. At this point, I\ninterrupt the account of the quantum theory in order to describe what happened\nto Einstein and his family from 1932 to 1945.1)452 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nvectors to the Dirac equation and to generalize the formalism to general relativity.\n454 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nDuring the years 1933-45 Einstein spoke out less on political issues than he\nhad done before or would do again after the war. Einstein on Objective Reality\nIn his Como address, Bohr had remarked that quantum mechanics, like relativity\ntheory, demands refinements of our everyday perceptions of inanimate natural\nphenomena. Already then, in 1927, he empha-\nsized that we have to treat with extreme care our use of language in recording the\nresults of observations that involve quantum effects.' Bohr's deep concern with the role of language\nin the appropriate interpretation of quantum mechanics never ceased. After 1933 it was his almost solitary position that quan-\ntum mechanics is logically consistent but that it is an incomplete manifestation of\nan underlying theory in which an objectively real description is possible.\nThis paper 'created a stir among physicists and has played a large role in philo-\nsophical discussion' [BIO]. But quantum mechanics tells us that p2 and q2 cannot\nsimultaneously be elements of reality because of the noncommutativity of the\n\"This stir reached the press.

Therefore quantum\nmechanics is incomplete.\nThe only part of this article that will ultimately survive, I believe, is this last\nphrase, which so poignantly summarizes Einstein's views on quantum mechanics\nin his later years. He did not believe\nthat the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper called for any change in the interpre-\ntation of quantum mechanics. In one of them [E30], he discussed the question of whether the\nquantum-mechanical notion of phenomenon should also apply to bodies of every-\nday size. Bohr was in Princeton when he put the\n*In 1950 Einstein mentioned Schroedinger and von Laue as the only ones who shared his views\n[E32].

When relativity was the issue, he would often talk of his efforts to\nunify gravitation and electromagnetism and of his hopes for the next steps.\nThe most interesting thing I learned from these conversations was how Einstein\nthought and, to some extent, who he was. It had\nnot taken long before I grasped the essence of the Einstein-Bohr dialogue: com-\nplementarity versus objective reality. One day I told Einstein a Jewish joke. In all the years I knew\nEinstein, I never read any of his papers, on the simple grounds that I already\nknew what to a physicist was memorable in them and did not need to know what\nhad been superseded. My discussions with\nEinstein never were historical interviews.\nI did read Einstein's papers as the years went by, and my interest in him as an\nhistorical figure grew. Following this, (16b) and (16c) are devoted\nto the abrupt emergence in 1919 of Einstein (whose genius had already been fully\nrecognized for some time by his scientific peers) as a charismatic world figure and\nto my views on the causes of this striking phenomenon. The book ends with a detailed\nEinstein chronology (32).\nBefore starting on a similar tour of the scientific part, I interject a few remarks\non Einstein and politics and on Einstein as a philosopher and humanist.\nWhenever I think of Einstein and politics, I recall my encounter with him in\nthe late evening of Sunday, April 11, 1954.) The operator asked for Dr Einstein. He was eager for a\nstatement by Einstein as soon as possible. I realized that pandemonium on Mercer\nStreet the next morning might be avoided by a brief statement that evening and\nso said that I would talk it over with Einstein and would call back in any event. After I told him the reason for\nmy call, Einstein burst out laughing.\nWe drew it up, and Einstein read it over the phone to the AP director in Wash-\nington.\nWas Einstein's initial response correct. Nothing was more alien\nto Einstein than to settle any issue by compromise, in his life or in his science.* In my view, Einstein was not only not naive\nbut highly aware of the nature of man's sorrows and his follies. After\nthe death of Leo Arons, a physicist Einstein admired for his political courage but\nwhom he did not know personally, he wrote an obituary in Sozialistische Mon-\natshefte [E2]. Much documentation related to Einstein's inter-\nests in and involvements with political matters is found in the book Einstein on\nPeace [Nl]).\nEinstein was a lover of wisdom. The answer to that\n\"The account of Einstein's consultancy given in [Gl] is inaccurate.\n**Einstein's cousin Lina Einstein died in Auschwitz. In 1943 Einstein, Godel, Bertrand Rus-\nsell, and Pauli gathered at Einstein's home to discuss philosophy of science about\nhalf a dozen times [Rl]. Further remarks by Einstein on philosophical issues\nwill be deferred until (16e), except for his comments on Newton.\nThe men whom Einstein at one time or another acknowledged as his precursors\nwere Newton, Maxwell, Mach, Planck, and Lorentz.\nIt seems to me that, when in midlife Einstein wrote of 'The wonderful events\nwhich the great Newton experienced in his young days. Of\ncourse, this opinion, held by modern physicists, has not prevented them from rec-\nognizing Einstein as by far the most important scientific figure of this century.\nHis special relativity includes the completion of the work of Maxwell and Lorentz.\nl6 INTRODUCTORY\nEinstein deserves to be given the same compliment he gave Newton: he, too,\nwas an artist in exposition. The student of Einstein should read him in Ger-\nman.\n**I have no clear picture of Einstein's habits and preferences in regard to literature.\nPURPOSE AND PLAN l~]\nAs a conclusion to this introductory sketch of Einstein the man, I should like to\nelaborate the statement made in the Preface that Einstein was the freest man I\nhave known.\nI now turn to a tour of Einstein's science. In that year Einstein produced six papers:\n1. The first paper on special relativity, received* June 30. The second paper on special relativity, containing the E = me2 relation,\nreceived* September 27. None of\nthese first five papers left much of a mark on physics, but I believe they were very\nimportant warming-up exercises in Einstein's own development. Whether these events helped to promote the emergence\nof Einstein's genius I cannot tell, though I believe that the arrival of the son may\nhave been a profound experience.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book. Three of these methods are found in Einstein's work of 1905. The confluence of all these answers is the result of important late nineteenth-\ncentury developments in experimental physics. Einstein's later work (1911) on the\nblueness of the sky and on critical opalescence yielded still other counting methods\n(5e). A\nsurvey of the contributions to this problem by Einstein's predecessors as well as\nby Einstein himself is presented in (4). In those early days, Einstein was not the\nonly one to underestimate the mathematical care that this very complex problem\nrightfully deserves.\nTo Einstein, the second problem was of deeper interest than the first.\nNevertheless, Einstein's preoccupation with the fundamental questions of sta-\ntistical mechanics was extremely vital since it led to his most important contri-\nbutions to the quantum theory. It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum.\nLong periods of gestation are a marked characteristic in Einstein's scientific\ndevelopment. Questions that lie at the root of the special theory of relativity\ndawned on him as early as 1895 (6d); the theory saw the light in June 1905.\nI focus next on special relativity. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. It begins with\nbrief remarks on the nineteenth century concept of the aether (6a), that quaint,\nhypothetical medium which was introduced for the purpose of explaining the\nPURPOSE AND PLAN 21\ntransmission of light waves and which was abolished by Einstein. From 1907 on, Einstein often\nemphasized the fundamental importance of the work by Michelson and Morley,\nbut continued to be remarkably reticent about any direct influence of that exper-\niment on his own development.\nTwo major figures, Lorentz and Poincare, take their place next to Einstein in\nthe history of special relativity. In 1905, Einstein, at that\ntime aware only of Lorentz's writings up to 1895, rediscovered these transfor-\nmations. In 1898, Poincare, one of the greatest mathematicians of his day and a\nconsummate mathematical physicist, had written that we have no direct intuition\nof the simultaneity of events occurring in two different places, a remark almost\ncertainly known to Einstein before 1905 (6b). In 1905 Einstein and Poincare\nstated independently and almost simultaneously (within a matter of weeks) the\ngroup properties of the Lorentz transformations and the addition theorem of veloc-\nities.\nSpecial relativity brought clarity to old physics and created new physics, in par-\nticular Einstein's derivation (also in 1905) of the relation E = me2 (7b). After 1905 Ein-\nstein paid only occasional attention to other implications (7d), mainly because\nfrom 1907 he was after bigger game: general relativity.\nThe history of the discovery of general relativity is more complicated.\nAfter 1915 Einstein continued to examine problems in general relativity.\nHubble's discovery that the universe is expanding was made in Einstein's lifetime. A sketchy account of the developments in general relativity after 1915\nup to the present appears in (15). Thus\nEinstein's work was the direct cause of the development of a new branch of math-\nematics, the theory of connections (17c). Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. That, I believe, was Einstein's one revolutionary contribution to physics\n(2). In (25) I describe in detail Einstein's response to this new development. In the absence of this synthesis, any assessment of Einstein's vision must be\npart of open history. General comments on relativity and quantum theory come\nnext, followed by a sketch of Einstein's early years.

The twentieth century physicist does not, of\ncourse, claim to have the definitive answer to this question. That, in very broad terms, is the lesson of the theory of\nrelativity, which Einstein created, and of quantum mechanics, which he eventually\naccepted as (in his words) the most successful theory of our period but which, he\nbelieved, was none the less only provisional in character. I was used to that by\nthen, and as I walked back I wondered once again about the question, Why does\nthis man, who contributed so incomparably much to the creation of modern phys-\nics, remain so attached to the nineteenth century view of causality.\nTo make that question more precise, it is necessary to understand Einstein's\ncredo in regard not just to quantum physics but to all of physics.

I came to understand how wrong I was in accepting a rather wide-\nspread belief that Einstein simply did not care anymore about the quantum theory. About\nrelativity he spoke with detachment, about the quantum theory with passion. I learned only much later that Einstein had once said to\nhis friend Otto Stern, 'I have thought a hundred times as much about the quantum\nproblems as I have about general relativity theory' [Jl]. One day I told Einstein a Jewish joke. In all the years I knew\nEinstein, I never read any of his papers, on the simple grounds that I already\nknew what to a physicist was memorable in them and did not need to know what\nhad been superseded. My discussions with\nEinstein never were historical interviews.\nI did read Einstein's papers as the years went by, and my interest in him as an\nhistorical figure grew.\nThe study of his papers, discussions with others who knew him, access to the\nEinstein Archives, personal reminiscences\u2014these are the ingredients which led to\nthis book. The early period, from Einstein's birth in 1879 to the beginning of his\nacademic career as Privatdozent in Bern in February 1908, is discussed in (3),\nwhich contains a sketch of his childhood, his school years (contrary to popular\nbelief he earned high marks in elementary as well as high school), his brief reli-\ngious phase, his student days, his initial difficulties in finding a job, and most of\nthe period he spent at the patent office in Bern, a period that witnesses the death\nof his father, his marriage to Mileva Marie, and the birth of his first son. The story of the Berlin days is continued\nin (16) which ends with Einstein's permanent departure from Europe. Following this, (16b) and (16c) are devoted\nto the abrupt emergence in 1919 of Einstein (whose genius had already been fully\nrecognized for some time by his scientific peers) as a charismatic world figure and\nto my views on the causes of this striking phenomenon. The book ends with a detailed\nEinstein chronology (32).\nBefore starting on a similar tour of the scientific part, I interject a few remarks\non Einstein and politics and on Einstein as a philosopher and humanist.\nWhenever I think of Einstein and politics, I recall my encounter with him in\nthe late evening of Sunday, April 11, 1954.) The operator asked for Dr Einstein. He was eager for a\nstatement by Einstein as soon as possible. I realized that pandemonium on Mercer\nStreet the next morning might be avoided by a brief statement that evening and\nso said that I would talk it over with Einstein and would call back in any event. After I told him the reason for\nmy call, Einstein burst out laughing.\nWe drew it up, and Einstein read it over the phone to the AP director in Wash-\nington.\nWas Einstein's initial response correct. Nothing was more alien\nto Einstein than to settle any issue by compromise, in his life or in his science.* In my view, Einstein was not only not naive\nbut highly aware of the nature of man's sorrows and his follies. After\nthe death of Leo Arons, a physicist Einstein admired for his political courage but\nwhom he did not know personally, he wrote an obituary in Sozialistische Mon-\natshefte [E2]. In 1923 Einstein became\na cofounder of the Association of Friends of the New Russia. Much documentation related to Einstein's inter-\nests in and involvements with political matters is found in the book Einstein on\nPeace [Nl]).\nEinstein was a lover of wisdom. The answer to that\n\"The account of Einstein's consultancy given in [Gl] is inaccurate.\n**Einstein's cousin Lina Einstein died in Auschwitz. It is as\ncertain that Einstein's interest in philosophy was genuine as it is that he did not\nconsider himself a philosopher. In 1943 Einstein, Godel, Bertrand Rus-\nsell, and Pauli gathered at Einstein's home to discuss philosophy of science about\nhalf a dozen times [Rl]. Further remarks by Einstein on philosophical issues\nwill be deferred until (16e), except for his comments on Newton.\nThe men whom Einstein at one time or another acknowledged as his precursors\nwere Newton, Maxwell, Mach, Planck, and Lorentz. As he told me more than\nonce, without Lorentz he would never have been able to make the discovery of\nspecial relativity. Of his veneration for Planck, I shall write in (18a); of the influ-\nence of Mach* in (15e); and of his views of Maxwell in (16e).\nEinstein's deep emotional urge not to let anything interfere with his thinking\ndates back to his childhood and lends an unusual quality of detachment to his\npersonal life. On the other hand, Einstein considered\nMach to be 'un deplorable philosophe' [E7], if only because to Mach the reality of atoms remained\nforever anathema.\nIt seems to me that, when in midlife Einstein wrote of 'The wonderful events\nwhich the great Newton experienced in his young days.' [E8], he described his own ideals, the desire for ful-\nfillment not just as a theorist but also as an experimental physicist.\n'Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of Science. Elsewhere Einstein\nwas quite explicit on this issue:\nWe now know that science cannot grow out of empiricism alone, that in the\nconstructions of science we need to use free invention which only a posteriori\ncan be confronted with experience as to its usefulness. [E10]\nEinstein again expressed his view that the scientific method had moved on in\nwords only he could have written:\nNewton, forgive me; you found the only way which in your age was just about\npossible for a man with the highest powers of thought and creativity. [Ell]\nHowever, in one respect Einstein forever continued to side with Newton and\nto quote his authority. On the occasion of the\nbicentenary of Newton's death, Einstein wrote to the secretary of the Royal Soci-\nety, 'All who share humbly in pondering over the secrets of physical events are\nwith you in spirit, and join in the admiration and love that bind us to Newton',\nthen went on to comment on the evolution of physics since Newton's day and\nconcluded as follows:\nIt is only in the quantum theory that Newton's differential method becomes\ninadequate, and indeed strict causality fails us. Einstein's hope for a return to that old causality is an impossible dream. Of\ncourse, this opinion, held by modern physicists, has not prevented them from rec-\nognizing Einstein as by far the most important scientific figure of this century.\nHis special relativity includes the completion of the work of Maxwell and Lorentz. In all these respects,\nEinstein's oeuvre represents the crowning of the work of his precursors, adding to\nand revising the foundations of their theories.\nl6 INTRODUCTORY\nEinstein deserves to be given the same compliment he gave Newton: he, too,\nwas an artist in exposition. The student of Einstein should read him in Ger-\nman.\n**I have no clear picture of Einstein's habits and preferences in regard to literature.\nPURPOSE AND PLAN l~]\nAs a conclusion to this introductory sketch of Einstein the man, I should like to\nelaborate the statement made in the Preface that Einstein was the freest man I\nhave known.\nI now turn to a tour of Einstein's science.\nEinstein never cared much for teaching courses. No one was ever awarded a\nPhD degree working with him, but he was always fond of discussing physics prob-\nlems, whether with colleagues his age or with people much younger. But,\nof course, theoretical physics was his main devotion.\nThere is no better way to begin this brief survey of his theoretical work than\nwith a first look at what he did in 1905. In that year Einstein produced six papers:\n1. The first paper on special relativity, received* June 30. The second paper on special relativity, containing the E = me2 relation,\nreceived* September 27. None of\nthese first five papers left much of a mark on physics, but I believe they were very\nimportant warming-up exercises in Einstein's own development. Whether these events helped to promote the emergence\nof Einstein's genius I cannot tell, though I believe that the arrival of the son may\nhave been a profound experience.\nEinstein's work before 1905 as well as papers 2, 3, and 6 of that year resulted\nfrom his interest in two central early twentieth-century problems, the subjects of\nPart II of this book. During that period the chemist, member\nof the youngest branch of science, argued the question in one context, the physicist\nin another, and each paid little attention to what the other was saying. Three of these methods are found in Einstein's work of 1905. The confluence of all these answers is the result of important late nineteenth-\ncentury developments in experimental physics. Einstein's later work (1911) on the\nblueness of the sky and on critical opalescence yielded still other counting methods\n(5e). The great masters of the nineteenth century\u2014Maxwell, Boltz-\nmann, Kelvin, van der Waals, and others\u2014did not, of course, sit and wait for the\nmolecular hypothesis to be proved before broaching problem number two. A\nsurvey of the contributions to this problem by Einstein's predecessors as well as\nby Einstein himself is presented in (4). In those early days, Einstein was not the\nonly one to underestimate the mathematical care that this very complex problem\nrightfully deserves.\nTo Einstein, the second problem was of deeper interest than the first.\nNevertheless, Einstein's preoccupation with the fundamental questions of sta-\ntistical mechanics was extremely vital since it led to his most important contri-\nbutions to the quantum theory. It is no accident that the term Boltzmann's prin-\nciple, coined by Einstein, appears for the first time in his March 1905 paper on\nthe light-quantum. It should\n2O INTRODUCTORY\nalso be remembered that the main applications of his first work (1904) on energy\nfluctuations (4c) are in the quantum domain. His analysis of these fluctuations in\nblackbody radiation led him to become the first to state, in 1909, long before the\ndiscovery of quantum mechanics, that the theory of the future ought to be based\non a dual description in terms of particles and waves (21 a).\nEinstein's active involvement with statistical physics began in 1902 and lasted\nuntil 1925, when he made his last major contribution to physics: his treatment of\nthe quantum statistics of molecules (23).\nLong periods of gestation are a marked characteristic in Einstein's scientific\ndevelopment. His preoccupation with quantum problems, which began shortly\nafter Planck's discovery of the blackbody radiation law late in 1900, bore its first\nfruit in March 1905. Questions that lie at the root of the special theory of relativity\ndawned on him as early as 1895 (6d); the theory saw the light in June 1905.\nI focus next on special relativity. One version of its history could be very brief:\nin June, 1905, Einstein published a paper on the electrodynamics of moving bod-\nies. It begins with\nbrief remarks on the nineteenth century concept of the aether (6a), that quaint,\nhypothetical medium which was introduced for the purpose of explaining the\nPURPOSE AND PLAN 21\ntransmission of light waves and which was abolished by Einstein. The question\nhas often been asked whether or not Einstein disposed of the aether because he\nwas familiar with the Michelson-Morley experiment, which, with great accuracy,\nhad demonstrated the absence of an anticipated drift of the aether as the earth\nmoved through it without obstruction (6a). From 1907 on, Einstein often\nemphasized the fundamental importance of the work by Michelson and Morley,\nbut continued to be remarkably reticent about any direct influence of that exper-\niment on his own development.\nTwo major figures, Lorentz and Poincare, take their place next to Einstein in\nthe history of special relativity. Lorentz, founder of the theory of electrons,\ncodiscoverer of the Lorentz contraction (as Poincare named it), interpreter of the\nZeeman effect, acknowledged by Einstein as his precursor, wrote down the Lor-\nentz transformations (so named by Poincare) in 1904. In 1905, Einstein, at that\ntime aware only of Lorentz's writings up to 1895, rediscovered these transfor-\nmations. In 1898, Poincare, one of the greatest mathematicians of his day and a\nconsummate mathematical physicist, had written that we have no direct intuition\nof the simultaneity of events occurring in two different places, a remark almost\ncertainly known to Einstein before 1905 (6b). In 1905 Einstein and Poincare\nstated independently and almost simultaneously (within a matter of weeks) the\ngroup properties of the Lorentz transformations and the addition theorem of veloc-\nities. Only Einstein saw the cru-\ncial new point: the dynamic aether must be abandoned in favor of a new kine-\nmatics based on two new postulates (7). Lorentz acknowledged this and developed a firm grasp of\nspecial relativity, but even after 1905 never quite gave up either the aether or his\nreservations concerning the velocity of light as an ultimate velocity (8).\nSpecial relativity brought clarity to old physics and created new physics, in par-\nticular Einstein's derivation (also in 1905) of the relation E = me2 (7b). After 1905 Ein-\nstein paid only occasional attention to other implications (7d), mainly because\nfrom 1907 he was after bigger game: general relativity.\nThe history of the discovery of general relativity is more complicated. In the quantum theory, Planck\nstarted before Einstein. In special relativity, Lorentz inspired him. During the next three and a half years,\nhis attention focuses on that crisis phenomenon, the quantum theory, rather than\non the less urgent problems of relativity (10).\nWith his habitual optimism he believes he has solved the fifty-year-old problem\n(13) of finding a field theory of gravitation. Einstein was canonized in 1919 when this second prediction also\nproved to be correct (16b).\nAfter 1915 Einstein continued to examine problems in general relativity. He was also the founder\nof general relativistic cosmology, the modern theory of the universe at large (15e).\nHubble's discovery that the universe is expanding was made in Einstein's lifetime.\nAfter he experimentally unified electricity and magnetism, had not Michael Far-\naday tried to observe whether gravity could induce electric currents by letting\npieces of metal drop from the top of the lecture room in the Royal Institution to\na cushion on the floor. And when his experiment\nshowed no effect, had he not written, 'They do not shake my strong feeling of the\nexistence of a relation between gravity and electricity, though they give no proof\nthat such a relation exists'. [Wl] Thoughts and visions such as these led Einstein\nto his program for a unified field theory.\nOn his road to general relativity, Einstein had found the nineteenth century\ngeometry of Riemann waiting for him. In 1916, mathematicians, acknowledging the stimulus\nof general relativity, began the very same pursuit for their own reasons. Thus\nEinstein's work was the direct cause of the development of a new branch of math-\nematics, the theory of connections (17c). Einstein chose to ignore those new\nforces although they were not and are not any less fundamental than the two\nwhich have been known about longer. But Einstein's dream, the joining of gravitation to other forces, has so far not\nbeen realized.\nIn concluding this tour, I return to Einstein's contributions to the quantum\ntheory. I must add that, late in 1906, Einstein became the founder of the quantum\ntheory of the solid state by giving the essentially correct explanation of the anom-\nalous behavior of hard solids, such as diamond, for example, at low temperatures\n(20). Einstein's paper of March\n1905 contains not one but two postulates. That, I believe, was Einstein's one revolutionary contribution to physics\n(2). In (25) I describe in detail Einstein's response to this new development.\nHowever, Einstein never had a good word for the relativity version of quantum\nmechanics known as quantum field theory.\nEinstein himself never gave up the search for a theory that would incorporate\nquantum phenomena but would nevertheless satisfy his craving for causality. His\nvision of a future interplay of relativity and quantum theory in a unified field\ntheory is the subject of the last scientific chapter of this book (26), in which I\nreturn to the picture drawn in the preface. In the absence of this synthesis, any assessment of Einstein's vision must be\npart of open history. General comments on relativity and quantum theory come\nnext, followed by a sketch of Einstein's early years. Then the physics begins.

The method\nhe used was to compare the times it takes for light to travel the same distance\neither parallel or transversely to the earth's motion relative to the aether. In his\narrangement a stationary aether would yield a time difference corresponding to\nabout an extra 1 /25 of a wavelength of yellow light traveling in the parallel direc-\ntion, an effect that can be detected by letting the transverse and parallel beams\ninterfere. So did Lorentz, who found\nan error in Michelson's theory of the experiment [L3] and who was dubious about\nthe interpretation of the results [ L4]. The paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment came out the\nfollowing November [M6]. In 1892 Lorentz queried Rayleigh: 'Can there be some\npoint in the theory of Mr Michelson's experiment which had as yet been over-\nlooked. In 1904 he wrote in the preface to his\nBaltimore lectures: 'Michelson and Morley have by their great experimental work\non the motion of the ether relatively to the earth raised the one and only serious\nobjection against our dynamical explanations. In May, he gave four lectures on relativity theory at Princeton\nUniversity [El].\n114 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nlished [M10]. The outcome\nof all this was that Miller received a thousand dollar prize for his Kansas City\npaper from the American Association for the Advancement of Science [L6]\u2014pre-\nsumably in part an expression of the resistance to relativity which could still be\nfound in some quarters [Bl]\u2014while Einstein got flooded with telegrams and let-\nters asking him to comment.\nLet us now move back to the times when Einstein was still virtually unknown\nand ask how Michelson reacted to Einstein's special theory of relativity and what\ninfluence the Michelson-Morley experiment had on Einstein's formulation of\nthat theory in 1905. Rela-\ntivity was young; even fifteen years later, relativity was not mentioned in Ein-\nstein's citation. Truly revealing, however, is Michelson's verdict on\nrelativity given in 1927 in his book Studies in Optics [Ml2].\nSUBTLE IS THE LORD 115\ntheory of relativity 'must be accorded a generous acceptance' and gave a clear\nexpose of Lorentz transformations and their consequences for the Michelson -\nMorley experiment and for the experiment of Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau\non the velocity of light in streaming water. The first one is that in the early days it was easier to understand the\nmathematics of special relativity than the physics.\nLet us turn to the influence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on Einstein's\ninitial relativity paper [E5]. Rather, its answer will help us to gain essential insights into Einstein's\nthinking and will prepare us for a subsequent discussion of the basic differences\nin the approaches of Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare.\nMichelson is mentioned neither in the first nor in any of Einstein's later\nresearch papers on special relativity. In 1907 Einstein was the first to write a review\narticle on relativity [E7], the first paper in which he went to the trouble of giving\na number of detailed references. Michelson and Morley are mentioned in that\nreview, in a semipopular article Einstein wrote in 1915 [E8], again in the Prince-\nton lectures of 1921 [El], and in the book The Meaning of Relativity [E9] (which\ngrew out of the Princeton lectures), where Einstein called the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment the most important one of all the null experiments on the aether drift.\nHowever, neither in the research papers nor in these four reviews does Einstein\never make clear whether before 1905 he knew of the Michelson-Morley experi-\nment. I have come across only one letter,\nwritten in 1923, by Michelson to Einstein [M13] and none by Einstein to\nMichelson. On January 15, 1931, at a dinner given in Einstein's honor\nat the Atheneum of Cal Tech, Einstein publicly addressed Michelson in person\nIl6 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nfor the first and last time: 'I have come among men who for many years have been\ntrue comrades with me in my labors. It was you\nwho led the physicists into new paths, and through your marvelous experimental\nwork paved the way for the development of the theory of relativity. Lorentz and FitzGerald out of which the special theory of\nrelativity developed' [E10]. In Pasadena, Einstein had asked Michelson why he had\nspent so much effort on high-precision measurements of the light velocity.\nNevertheless, the answers to both questions\u2014did Einstein know of Michelson's\nwork before 1905. did it influence his creation of the special theory of\nrelativity. We know this from discussions between\nShankland and Einstein in the 1950s and from an address entitled 'How I Created\nthe Relativity Theory' given by Einstein on December 14, 1922, at Kyoto Uni-\nversity (and referred to in what follows as the Kyoto address). Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S. 'I asked Professor Einstein when he had\nfirst heard of Michelson and his experiment. I was not conscious\nthat it had influenced me directly during the seven years that relativity had been\nmy life.\" However, Einstein said\nthat in the years 1905-1909, he thought a great deal about Michelson's result, in\nhis discussion with Lorentz and others in his thinking about general relativity. He\nthen realized (so he told me) that he had also been conscious of Michelson's result\nbefore 1905 partly through his reading of the papers of Lorentz and more because\nhe had simply assumed this result of Michelson to be true' [S6].\nc) December 1952, letter by Einstein to Shankland. Lorentz's decisive investigation of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (1895) with which I was acquainted before developing the spe-\ncial theory of relativity.\nIt seems sensible to attach more value to the later comments, made upon further\nreflection, and therefore to conclude that Einstein did know of Michelson and\nMorley before 1905. This is the most crucial statement Einstein ever made on\nthe origins of the special theory of relativity. It shows that the principal argument\nwhich ultimately led him to the special theory was not so much the need to resolve\nthe conflict between the Michelson-Morley result and the version of aether theory\nprevalent in the late nineteenth century but rather, independent of the Michelson-\nMorley experiment, the rejection of this nineteenth century edifice as inherently\nunconvincing and artificial.\nIn order to appreciate how radically Einstein departed from the ancestral views\non these issues, it is necessary to compare his position with the 'decisive investi-\ngation' published by Lorentz in 1895 [L4]. Note, however,\nthat it was easy to take the Michelson-Morley experiments for granted (as Ein-\nstein repeatedly said he did) once a new look at the first-order effects had led to\nthe new logic of the special theory of relativity. Note also that this experiment was\ndiscussed at length in Lorentz's paper of 1895 and that Einstein was familiar with\nthis paper before 1905.Il8 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nThe concept of an aether at absolute rest, introduced in 1818 by Fresnel in his\ncelebrated letter to Dominique Francois Jean Arago [Fl], served the express pur-\npose of explaining this aberration effect (which would be zero if the aether moved\nalong with the earth). In effect, this is the first route that led me to\nwhat is now called the special principles of relativity. I had just a chance to\nread Lorentz's 1895 monograph, in which he had succeeded in giving a com-\nprehensive solution to problems of electrodynamics within the first approxi-\nmation, in other words, as far as the quantities of higher order than the square\nof the velocity of a moving body to that of light were neglected.\nIn his first paper on relativity, Einstein mentions 'the failed attempts to detect\na motion of the earth relative to the \"light-medium\" ' without specifying what\nattempts he had in mind.\nThe post-Maxwell, pre-Einstein attitude which eventually became preponderant\nwas that electrodynamics is Maxwell's equations plus a specification of the charge\nand current densities contained in these equations plus a conjecture on the nature\nof the aether.\n**See the second volume of Hertz's collected works [H3], which is also available in English trans-\nlation [H4],\n120 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\npressibility, and the extent to which the earth dragged the aether along.'\nThe most important question for all these authors of aethers and makers of\nMaxwell theories was to find a dynamic understanding of the aberration of light,\nof Fresnel drag, and, later, of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Rather s Einstein's resolution of the diffi-\nculties besetting the electrodynamics of moving bodies is cast in an all-embracing\nframework of a new kinematics. Going beyond Lorentz and Poincare, he based\nhis theory on the first of the two major re-analyses of the problem of measurement\nwhich mark the break between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries (the\nother one being quantum mechanics). Instead I shall mainly\nconcentrate on Lorentz and Poincare, the precursors of the new kinematics. A\nfinal comparison of the contributions of Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare will be\ndeferred until Chapter 8. Nor shall I discuss Lorentz's finest contribution, his\natomistic interpretation of the Maxwell equations in terms of charges and currents\ncarried by fundamental particles (which he called charged particles in 1892, ions\nin 1895, and, finally, electrons in 1899), even though this work represents such a\nmajor advance in the development of electrodynamics. Rather, I shall confine\nmyself largely to the evolution and the interpretation of the Lorentz\ntransformation:\nwhich relates one set of space-time coordinate systems (x',y',2.\nAs to Einstein himself, in his first relativity paper he mentions only three phys-\nicists by name: Maxwell, Hertz, and Lorentz. As he repeatedly pointed out else-\nwhere, in 1905 he knew Lorentz's work only up to 1895. It follows\u2014as we shall\nsee\u2014that in 1905 Einstein did not know of Lorentz transformations. Nor did he know at that time those papers by Poincare which deal\nin technical detail with relativity issues.7, he gave a derivation of the Doppler shift, but only for\nthe long-familiar longitudinal effect of order v/c. Indeed, Lorentz's Columbia University lectures, given in 1906 and published\nin book form in 1909, contain the following comment: 'In a paper . might therefore have been\n122 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nborrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations\nfor the free ether is contained in his paper' [L7]. (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether.)\nAt a physics meeting in 1908, Minkowski drew attention to Voigt's 1887 paper\n[M16]. Lorentz. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3]. The main purpose of Lorentz's paper was to examine how well Fresnel's\nstationary aether fitted the facts. This paper also marks the beginning of\nLorentz's road toward the Lorentz transformations, our next subject. Then to first order in v/c, there is a correspond-\ning state in the second system in which E', H', P' are the same functions of x',t'\nas E, H, P are of x,t, where124 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nIt consists in the supposition that the line joining two points of a solid body, if at\nfirst parallel to the direction of the earth's motion, does not keep the same length\nwhen it is subsequently turned through 90\u00b0' [L13].10) only as a convenient mathematical tool for proving a physical theorem, in\nhis case that to O(v/c) terrestrial optical experiments are independent of the\nmotion of the earth, a result already mentioned in Section 6a.9 was\nobviously familiar to Lorentz, but the novel Eq.\nAs has been noted repeatedly, in 1905 Einstein knew of Lorentz's work only\nup to 1895. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.10, his proof of the first-order theorem\nfor optical phenomena, his need to supplement this proof with the contraction\nhypothesis, and, finally, his new postulate of the Lorentz force, Eq.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned. Lorentz discusses the status of his work in a lecture given in Diisseldorf\n[LI8]. Some years ago [in\n1899] I had already sought to frame a theory of this kind' [L20]. In 1899 he wrote\ndown the transformations\nwhich are the Lorentz transformations (Eq. Thus the reduction of the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction to a con-\n126 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nsequence of Lorentz transformations* is a product of the nineteenth century.\n1904. However, as far as the\nhistory of relativistic kinematics is concerned, the story of Lorentz as precursor to\nEinstein is herewith complete.4) but also the proof that one arrives at the FitzGerald-\nLorentz contraction with the help of these transformations [L21].' Turning to theoretical ideas, he noted that the Lorentz theory\n'is the most satisfactory one we have.' He expressed his unease with the idea of an absolute velocity: 'If we suc-\nceed in measuring something we will always have the freedom to say that it is not\n*This address is available in English as Chapters 9 and 10 in Science and Hypothesis [P8j.\n\"'During the period 1895 to 1900, Poincare considered it a flaw of the theory that it did not satisfy\nmomentum conservation in the Newtonian sense, that is, conservation of momentum for matter only.\n128 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nthe absolute velocity, and if it is not the velocity relative to the aether, it can always\nbe the velocity relative to a new unknown fluid with which we would fill space. He considers two\nobservers in uniform relative motion who wish to synchronize their clocks by\nmeans of light signals.' All phenomena seen by one\nobserver are retarded relative to the other, but they all are retarded equally (Poin-\ncare points out) and 'as demanded by the relativity principle [the observer] cannot\nknow whether he is at rest or in absolute motion.' The reference to com-\nplementary hypotheses makes clear that relativity theory had not yet been\ndiscovered.'\nThe account of Einstein's precursors ends here, on a note of indecision. Lorentz\ntransformations had been written down. The\nvelocity of light as a limiting velocity had been conjectured. But prior to 1905 there\nwas no relativity theory. Let us now turn to what Poincare did next, not as a\nprecursor to Einstein but essentially simultaneously with him. Poincare, one of the\nvery few true leaders in mathematics and mathematical physics of his day, knew,\nof course, the electromagnetic theory in all its finesses. From 1897 to\n1900 he wrote several articles on the theory of Lorentz [PI3].\nJune 30, 1905. Einstein's first paper on relativity is received by the Annalen\nder Physik.\nJuly, 1905.\nThe June paper begins with the remark that neither the aberration of light and\nrelated phenomena nor the work of Michelson reveals any evidence for an absolute\nmotion of the earth.' Next Poincare refers to the contraction hypoth-\nesis and to Lorentz's paper of 1904 [L20] in which\u2014as he has it\u2014Lorentz had\nsucceeded in modifying the hypothesis 'in such a way as to bring it in accordance\nwith the complete impossibility of determining absolute motion. However, in June he already had the\ncorrect transformation properties of the velocities, the point Lorentz had missed.\n'I have been led to modify and complete [Lorentz's analysis] in certain points of\ndetail.'\nThe final topic discussed in this paper concerns gravitation.\nHe concludes that therefore Newton's laws need modification and that there\nshould exist gravitational waves which propagate with the velocity of light. 'It is here that I must point out for the first time a difference with Lorentz'\n[PI6].\nI shall return later to the efforts by Lorentz in 1904 and by Poincare in 1905\nto give a theory of the electron. However, I believe I have presented at this point\nall the evidence that bears on the role of Lorentz and of Poincare in the develop-\nment of relativity theory. I shall now let their case rest until the discussion of\nEinstein's first two papers on the subject has been completed.\nAs a last step preparatory to the account of Einstein's discovery of relativity, I\nshould like to mention what little we know about his thoughts on the subject prior\nto 1905. Einstein before 1905\nEinstein's curiosity in electromagnetic theory goes back at least to his Pavia days\nof 1895, which followed his escape from the hated high school in Munich. The\nfollowing brief and rather disconnected remarks bear on his interest in electro-\ndynamics during the decade preceding his creation of the special theory of\nrelativity.* In 1895 Einstein sent a manuscript entitled Uber die\nUntersuchung des Atherzustandes im magnetischen Felde (On the Examination\nof the State of the Aether in a Magnetic Field) to his uncle Caesar Koch in Bel-\ngium. This paper\u2014which Einstein never published\u2014was accompanied by a cov-\nering letter in which he wrote: '[The manuscript] deals with a very special theme\nand is .'\n*In 1950, Einstein dated this manuscript to be from 1894 or 1895. Evidently Einstein believed in an\naether at that time. In his final autobiographical note [El2], Einstein\nwrote, 'During that year [sometime between October 1895 and the early fall of\n1896] in Aarau the question came to me: If one runs after a light wave with [a\nvelocity equal to the] light velocity, then one would encounter a time-independent\nwavefield. This was the first\njuvenile thought experiment which has to do with the special theory of relativity'\n(and he added, 'Invention is not the product of logical thought, even though the\nfinal product is tied to a logical structure. Also, in his more extensive autobio-\ngraphical notes, published in 1949, Einstein remarked that 'after ten years of\nreflection such a principle [special relativity] resulted from [this] paradox upon\nwhich I had already hit at the age of sixteen' [E6]. 'He\nencountered at once, in his second year of college [1897-8], the problem of light,\nether and the earth's movement.\n132 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nThe skepticism of his teachers was too great, the spirit of enterprise too small. A letter by Einstein to Grossmann, written in\n1901 from Winterthur, informs us that aether drift experiments were still on Ein-\nstein's mind: 'A new and considerably simpler method for investigating the motion\nof matter relative to the light-aether has occurred to me.\nThis letter also shows that Einstein still believed in an aether as late as 1901. On the evening of December 5, 1903, Albert Einstein,\ntechnical expert third class with provisional appointment, held a lecture in the\nconference room of the Hotel Storchen in Bern before the Naturforschende\nGesellschaft Bern. In the same lecture Einstein remarked, 'It is never easy to talk\nabout how I got to the theory of relativity because there would be various con-\ncealed complexities to motivate human thinking and because they worked with\ndifferent weights' [Ol]. Even with this admonition in mind, it would seem that\nthe following is a fair summary of Einstein's work and thoughts on electrody-\nnamics prior to 1905. He knew the 1895 paper of Lorentz in which the\nMichelson-Morley experiment is discussed at length.\nIt is virtually certain, however, that prior to 1905 Einstein was aware of the\n1900 Paris address by Poincare and that he had also read Poincare's remark of\n1898 concerning the lack of intuition about the equality of two time intervals.\nBefore 1905 Einstein, together with his friends of the Akademie Olympia, did\nindeed read some of Poincare's general essays on science: 'In Bern I had regular\nphilosophical reading and discussion evenings, together with K. This last book, the only one of the four to\nappear before 1905, is the one Einstein and his friends read in Bern. I therefore\nbelieve that, prior to his own first paper on relativity, Einstein knew the Paris\naddress in which Poincare suggested that the lack of any evidence for motion rel-\native to the aether should hold generally to all orders in v/c and that 'the cancel-\nlation of the [velocity-dependent] terms will be rigorous and absolute. Of these, he singles out one and only\n134 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\none, La Science et I'Hypothese, for the following comment: '[This] book pro-\nfoundly impressed us and kept us breathless for weeks on end' [E15].\nI must say more about Einstein and Poincare and shall do so in Chapter 8 after\nhaving discussed Einstein's creation of special relativity in the next chapter.), A Debate on the Theory of Relativity.

June 1905: Special Relativity Defined,\nLorentz Transformations Derived\n7. Relativity's Aesthetic Origins. Such was the sensible prejudice of nineteenth cen-\ntury physics.\nThe special theory of relativity divested the aether of its principal mechanical\nproperty, absolute rest, and thereby made the aether redundant. As Einstein put\nit in the introduction to his June 1905 paper (referred to in this chapter as the\nJune paper), 'the introduction of a \"light-aether\" will prove to be superfluous\nsince, according to the view to be developed [here], neither will a \"space in abso-\nlute rest\" endowed with special properties be introduced nor will a velocity vector\nbe associated with a point of empty space in which electromagnetic processes take\nplace' [El].* Special relativity represents the abandonment of mechanical pictures\nas an aid to the interpretation of electromagnetism. The preference for uniformity of relative\nmotion makes this version of relativity a special one.\nIn the spring of 1905, even before the completion of the relativity paper, Ein-\nstein had written to his friend Conrad Habicht, 'The fourth work [i., El, the\nfourth paper Einstein published in 1905] is available only in draft form and is an\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies in which use is made of a modification of the\ntenets about space and time; the purely kinematic part of this work will surely\ninterest you' [E2]. In its entirety, the June paper consists of an introduction,\nfive sections on kinematics followed by five sections on electrodynamics, no refer-\nences, and one acknowledgment. The kinematic part contains the complete first\nprinciples of the special relativity theory.\n138\nTHE NEW KINEMATICS 139\nAs indicated in Chapter 6, special relativity was born after a decade of gestation. At any rate, at that time I felt certain of the\ntruth of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations in electrodynamics. All the more, it\nshowed to us the relations of the so-called invariance of the velocity of light that\nthose equations should hold also in the moving frame of reference. This invariance\nof the velocity of light was, however, in conflict with the rule of addition of veloc-\nities we knew of well in mechanics. I had wasted time almost a year in fruitless considerations, with\na hope of some modification of Lorentz's idea, and at the same time I could not\nbut realize that it was a puzzle not easy to solve at all.\" My solution was really for the very concept of time, that is, that\ntime is not absolutely defined but there is an inseparable connection between time\nand the signal velocity. Five weeks after my recognition of this, the present\ntheory of special relativity was completed. As to the completion of the work\nin five weeks, since the paper was received by the Annalen der Physik on June\n30, Einstein's total concentration on relativity followed immediately upon the\nrelief of his having finished three major projects in statistical physics: the paper\non the light-quantum, his thesis, and the paper on Brownian motion, completed\non March 17, April 30, and around May 10, respectively.\nIn 1905 Einstein's belief in 'the truth of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations' was\nnot unqualified, as we shall see later. It was strong enough, however, for him to\nperceive the conflict between the constancy of the velocity of light (in the vacuum)\n140 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nand the relativity principle of classical mechanics.**\n(Recall that in 1905 there existed as yet no evidence against the general validity\nof Galilean invariance in pure mechanics.f Einstein opted for the alter-\nnative: 'The phenomena of electrodynamics and mechanics possess no properties\ncorresponding to the idea of absolute rest' [El].\nI argued in Chapter 6 that Einstein rejected the nineteenth century explanations\nof the first-order aether drift effects as unconvincing and artificial and that the\nsecond-order Michelson-Morley paradox was to some extent secondary to him.\nAdd to this his remark that 'Maxwell's electrodynamics\u2014as usually understood\nat the present time\u2014when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which\nare not inherent in the phenomena' and one has the motivation for the June paper:\nEinstein was driven to the special theory of relativity mostly by aesthetic argu-\nments, that is, arguments of simplicity. The term inertial frame gained currency only some time later, as\ndid the terms Galilean invariance and Lorentz invariance, which I freely use from now on.\nFitzGerald and Lorentz had already seen that the explanation of the Michel-\nson-Morley experiment demanded the introduction of a new postulate, the con-\ntraction hypothesis.\nWhat is so captivating about the Einstein of 1905 is the apparent ease and the\nfraicheur with which he introduces new ideas.\nThe big question was, of course, the compatibility of the two postulates, about\nwhich Einstein had the following to say in his review article of 1907 [E3]: 'Sur-\nprisingly, it turned out that it was only necessary to formulate the concept of time\nsufficiently precisely to overcome the first-mentioned difficulty [i., the Michel-\nson-Morley result, which Einstein did mention for the first time in this 1907\npaper]. If only for enjoyment, these sections ought\nto be read by all scientists, whether or not they are familiar with relativity.** In a given inertial\nframe an observer A measures his position xk relative to the origin by means of\nrigid rods, using (as Einstein states explicitly) 'the methods of Euclidean geome-\ntry.\n142 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nB's, and B's with that of a third observer C, then A's is synchronous with C's. In an unpublished manuscript,f written in 1921, Einstein spells out\nthree additional assumptions which are made in this reasoning: (1) Homogeneity:\nthe properties of rods and clocks depend neither on their position nor on the time\nat which they move, but only on the way in which they move. Einstein's example: two identical rods R, and R2\nare coincident in a given inertial frame in which two observers O, and O2 have\nsynchronized their respective clocks. Observer O, also measures\nthe duration t\\ for light to move from one end of R2 to the other and back.'\nThe two postulates of special relativity have physical content only if the exper-\nimental prescriptions for measuring position and time (and, therefore, for velocity)\nare added. The postulates together with these prescriptions fully specify Einstein's\ntheory of special relativity. From the Postulates to the Lorentz Transformations.\nEinstein obtained this relation by deriving the Lorentz transformation from his\npostulates.\nTHE NEW KINEMATICS 143\nThe relations between the two sets of coordinates implied by these two equations\nare assumed to be linear, in accordance with the homogeneity of space and time.8 in the discussion of papers by Lorentz\nand Poincare.8) from first\nprinciples occurs for the first time in Einstein's paper, however.8 with a velocity v given by\nTwenty years later, Einstein heard something about the Lorentz group that\ngreatly surprised him.

The honor of the first derivation (in 1907) goes\nto Max von Laue, who pointed out that 'according to the relativity principle,\nlight is completely dragged along by the body [i.13 by means of\na dynamic calculation that does not explicitly involve relativity [P5].\ng) Einstein rather casually mentioned that if two synchronous clocks G, and C2\nare at the same initial position and if C2 leaves A and moves along a closed\norbit, then upon return to A, C2 will run slow relative to C,, as often observed\nsince in the laboratory.

Also, he rightly regarded his own quantum\nhypotheses of 1905 more of a new phenomenological description than a new the-\nory, in sharp contrast to his relativity theory, which he rightly regarded as a true\ntheory with clearly defined first principles.\nNot just in 1905 but throughout his life Einstein considered quantum theory as\na preliminary to a true theory and relativity as the royal road toward such a the-\nory.\n148 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\n7b.

'Like the quantum of\naction in the quantum theory, so the velocity of light is the absolute, central point\nof the theory of relativity.' During the winter semester of 1905-6, Planck pre-\nsented Einstein's theory in the physics colloquium in Berlin. As a result von Laue became another early\nconvert to relativity, published in 1907 the pretty note [LI] on the Fizeau exper-\niment, did more good work on the special theory, and became the author of the\nfirst monograph on special relativity [L4]. The\nfirst PhD thesis on relativity was completed under his direction [M3].\nThe first paper bearing on relativity but published by someone other than Ein-\nstein was by Planck [P6], as best I know. Among his new results I mention the\nfirst occasion on which the momentum-velocity relation\nof relativistic point mechanics were written down.\nthe trandformation laws\nand the varational principleTHE NEW KINEMATICS 151\n7.23 via\nthe energy-momentum conservation laws of mechanics was not found until 1909\n[L5].\nAmong other early papers on relativity, I mention one by Ehrenfest in 1907\n[El7], in which is asked for the first time the important question: How does one\napply Lorentz transformations to a rigid body.\nNot only the theoreticians took early note of the relativity theory.\nThe publication of the 1905 papers on special relativity marked the beginning\nof the end of Einstein's splendid isolation at the patent office. 'The young man who met me made such\nan unexpected impression on me that I could not believe he could be the father of\nthe relativity theory,' von Laue later recalled [S2]. Yet in these early years the relativists were few in\nnumber. In July 1907 Planck wrote to Einstein, 'As long as the advocates of the\nrelativity principle form such a modest-sized crowd, it is doubly important for\nthem to agree with one another' [P10].\nThen, in 1908, came the 'space and time' lecture of Herman Minkowski. In\n1902, Minkowski, at one time Einstein's teacher in Zurich, had moved to the\nUniversity of Goettingen. There, on November 5, 1907, he gave a colloquium\nabout relativity in which he identified Lorentz transformations with pseudorota-\ntions for which\n152 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nwhere xl} x2, x3 denote the spatial variables. Soon thereafter Minkowski published a detailed paper [M5] in\nwhich for the first time the Maxwell-Lorentz equations are presented in their\nmodern tensor form, the equations of point mechanics are given a similar treat-\nment, and the inadequacy of the Newtonian gravitation theory from the relativistic\npoint of view is discussed. Terms such as spacelike vector, timelike vector, light\ncone, and world line stem from this paper.\nThus began the enormous formal simplification of special relativity.* However, in\n1912 he adopted tensor methods and in 1916 acknowledged his indebtedness to\nMinkowski for having greatly facilitated the transition from special to general\nrelativity [E20].\nMinkowski's semitechnical report on these matters, the 'space and time' lecture\ngiven in Cologne in 1908, began with these words:** 'The views of space and time\nwhich I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics,\nand therein lies their strength., the relativity postulates], I\nlike to think, is the true nucleus of an electromagnetic image of the world, which,\ndiscovered by Lorentz, and further revealed by Einstein, now lies open in the full\nlight of day' [M6].\nThe rapid growth of Einstein's reputation in scientific circles dates from about\n1908. Einstein in\nPrague. The principle of relativity has eliminated the difficulties which\nexisted in electrodynamics and has made it possible to predict for a moving system\nall electromagnetic phenomena which are known for a system at rest.' After enu-\nmerating some features of the theory he continued, 'From a purely logical point\nof view, the relativity principle must be considered as one of the most significant\naccomplishments ever achieved in theoretical physics. [Relativity] was discovered in\nan inductive way, after all attempts to detect absolute motion had failed. While\nLorentz must be considered as the first to have found the mathematical content of\nthe relativity principle, Einstein succeeded in reducing it to a simple principle. How-\never, Wien's excellent account shows that it had taken the real pros a reasonably\nshort time to realize that the special theory of relativity constituted a major\nadvance. Einstein and the Special Theory After 1905\nThe fifth section of Einstein's review paper on relativity, completed in 1907, deals\nwith gravitation and contains this statement: 'The principle of the constancy of\nthe light velocity can be used also here [i. In addition, from\n1908 until some time in 1911 the quantum theory rather than relativity was\nuppermost in his mind (see Chapter 10).\nApart from review articles and general lectures, Einstein's work on the conse-\nquences of the special theory was over by 1909.

In 1910, Einstein\npublished a brief note on the nonrelativistic definition of the ponderomotive force\nin a magnetic field [E26]. Special relativity is, of course, discussed in his book The Mean-\ning of Relativity [E33].\nTHE NEW KINEMATICS 155\nWe have now discussed special relativity from its nineteenth century antece-\ndents to Einstein's motivation, his paper of 1905 and its sequels, and the early\nreactions to the new theory. I shall not discuss the further developments in classical\nspecial relativity.\nRemaining unfinished business, mainly related to the roles of Einstein, Lorentz,\nand Poincare, will be discussed in Chapter 8.\n'A close analogy to this question of electromagnetic mass is furnished by a sim-\nple hydrodynamic problem,' Lorentz told his listeners at Columbia University\nearly in 1906 [L8]. The analogy to which Lorentz referred\nwas first noted by J.\nSuch was the situation when in 1904 Lorentz proposed a new model: the elec-\ntron at rest is again a little sphere, but it is subject to the FitzGerald-Lorentz\ncontraction [L9]. 'If\none wishes to retain [the Lorentz theory] and avoid intolerable contradictions, one\nmust assume a special force which explains both the contraction [in the direction\nof motion] and the constancy of the two [other] axes' [PI5].31 in the form158 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nwhere V = 4va^/3y is the (contracted) volume of the electron and P = 3/uc2/\n16ira3 is a scalar pressure.

Lorentz vacillated: The experiments 'are decidedly unfavorable to the idea\nof a contraction, such as I attempted to work out.' The final experimental verdict\nin favor of relativity came in the years 1914-16.**\nSpecial relativity killed the classical dream of using the ener-\ngy-momentum-velocity relations of a particle as a means of probing the dynamic\norigins of its mass. In 1908 Bucherer informed Einstein that his, Bucherer's,\nexperiments had led him to abandon his own model in favor of the relativity prediction [B6].\n160 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nReferences\nAl.

In physics the great novelties were, first, that the\nrecording of measurements of space intervals and time durations demanded more\ndetailed specifications than were held necessary theretofore and, second, that the\nlessons of classical mechanics are correct only in the limit v/c <K. In later years all three men, Einstein, Lorentz, and\nPoincare, reacted to the special theory of relativity in ways which arouse curiosity.\n163\n164 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nWhy, on the whole, was Einstein so reticent to acknowledge the influence of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment on his thinking. Why did Poincare never understand special relativity. Though their concerns may not have been as profound\nas relativity, I often found it baffling to answer such questions as those just raised. Return-\ning to Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare, the questions I raised about them are the\nresult of patient reading of their papers. Einstein and the Literature. In agreeing to review relativity theory, Ein-\nstein wrote to Stark, 'I should note that unfortunately I am not in a position to\norient myself about everything that has been published on this subject, because\nthe library is closed in my free time. Apart from my own papers, I know of a\npaper by Lorentz (1904), one by Cohn, one by Mosengeil, and two by Planck. Thus neither Einstein nor Stark\nwas aware of Poincare's long paper bearing on relativity, completed in July 1905\nand published in the 1906 volume of Rendiconti del Circolo matematico di\nPalermo [PI]. Nevertheless, especially in view of\nthe exchange between Einstein and Stark, I see no grounds for thinking that in\n1907 Einstein knew of Poincare's paper and chose to ignore it.\nHowever, in view of the fact that the questions under consideration are treated\nhere from a new point of view, I believed I could dispense with a literature search\nwhich would be very troublesome for me, especially since it is to be hoped that\nother authors will fill this gap, as was commendably done by Herr Planck and\nHerr Kaufmann on the occasion of my first paper on the principle of relativity'\n[E5].**\nThe period during which Einstein was unaware of Poincare's technical writing\non relativity now stretches into 1908. I noted in Section 6b that by 1905 Einstein\nhad already read Poincare's La Science et I'Hypothese, in which it is conjectured\nthat the undetectability of the earth's motion relative to the aether should hold to\nfSee Section 7c.\"\n** Einstein was evidently able to get to the literature if he set his mind to it. I would not be surprised if Einstein had copied\nthat reference from one of Lorentz's papers. Also, in 1906 Einstein mentioned [E6] a paper by\nPoincare [P2] which came to his attention because it appeared in a Festschrift for Lorentz.\nl66 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nall orders in v/c and also in which critical comments are made on the naive use\nof simultaneity. It cannot be said, however, that the content of Einstein's June\n1905 paper depends in any technical sense on these important remarks by Poin-\ncare. Others in Einstein's position might perhaps have chosen to mention Poincare\nat the earliest opportunity. However, it does not seem to me that Einstein had\ncompelling reasons to do so in 1905. I shall return soon to what Einstein had to\nsay about Poincare in later years. Here I note that Poincare's name appears only\nonce in a paper by Einstein on relativity, to wit, in 'Geometric und Erfahrung,'\nthe text of a lecture he gave in 1921 on general relativity [E7] in which he praises\n'der tiefe und scharfsinnige Poincare,' the deep and sharp-witted P. Lorentz and the Aether.\nLorentz's words about Kaufmann are found in his 1906 Columbia lectures, the\npublication of which was held up for three years 'on account of my wish to give\nsome further development to the subject' [L2]. Despite this considerable delay,\n'Einstein's principle of relativity [has not] received an adequate treatment' [L2].\n'It is certainly remarkable that these relativity concepts, also those concerning\ntime, have found such a rapid acceptance.\n'Finally, it should be noted that the daring assertion that one can never observe\nvelocities larger than the velocity of light contains a hypothetical restriction of\nwhat is accessible to us, [a restriction] which cannot be accepted without some\nreservation. Light moves with a velocity c km/s. The classical mind asserts, the relativistic mind\ndenies, that a velocity which can be imagined mathematically can necessarily be\nreached physically.\nAs I understand Lorentz, he was a leader in theoretical physics who fully\ngrasped all the physical and mathematical aspects of the special theory of relativity\nbut who nevertheless could not quite take leave of a beloved classical past. In a draft* of a\nletter to Einstein, written in January 1915 [L5], Lorentz wrote the following\nabout the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction: 'I added the remark that one arrives\nat this hypothesis if one extends to other forces what one can already say about\nthe influence of a translation on electrostatic forces.' Lorentz never fully made the transition from the old dynamics\nto the new kinematics. Poincare does not describe Einstein's theory.

It is evident that as late as 1909 Poincare did not\nknow that the contraction of rods is a consequence of the two Einstein postulates.\nPoincare therefore did not understand one of the most basic traits of special\nrelativity. It is likewise the case in a\nsemipopular account of relativity which Poincare wrote in 1908 [P5].\nMy own assessment of Poincare's contributions to relativity coincides with what\nwas said about him during the opening remarks of the meeting in Paris of the\nSociete Francaise de Philosophic, referred to earlier: 'The solution anticipated by\nPoincare was given by Einstein in his memoir of 1905 on special relativity. Whittaker and the History of Relativity. His treatment of the special theory of relativity in the latter volume\nshows how well the author's lack of physical insight matches his ignorance of the\nliterature. I would have refrained from commenting on his treatment of special\nrelativity were it not for the fact that his book has raised questions in many minds\nabout the priorities in the discovery of this theory. Whittaker's opinion on this\npoint is best conveyed by the title of his chapter on this subject: 'The Relativity\nTheory of Poincare and Lorentz.\nEinstein's reaction was, 'I do not have to read the thing.

Regarding\nPoincare's contributions to the principles of relativity, Lorentz's view is balanced,\nas always. In a letter to Einstein, Lorentz rem-\ninisced about the origins of the special theory: 'I felt the need for a more general\ntheory, which I tried to develop later [i. Lorentz and Einstein. Einstein's thoughts and feelings about Lorentz were a blend of respect, love,\nand awe. In a memorial service held at the Univer-\nsity of Leiden shortly after Lorentz's death, Einstein was one of the speakers: 'The\nenormous significance of his work consisted therein, that it forms the basis for the\ntheory of atoms and for the general and special theories of relativity. The special\ntheory was a more detailed expose of those concepts which are found in Lorentz's\nresearch of 1895'[Ell].

He does not remain attached to the classical principles and,\nfaced with a physics problem, promptly envisages all possibilities. Twice, having met Einstein and written this letter, did he comment on\nrelativity [P7, P8].\nIn 1919, the mathematician Mittag-Leffler wrote to Einstein, asking him to\ncontribute an article to the Ada Mathematica volume in honor of Poincare [M3]. In reply to a question about the\norigins of relativity theory, Einstein said, 'It was found that [Galilean invariance]\nwould not conform to the rapid motions in electrodynamics. This led the Dutch\nprofessor Lorentz and myself to develop the theory of special relativity . In this\nletter Einstein mentions for the first time (as far as I know) Poincare's role in\nregard to the special theory: 'Hoffentlich wird dafiir gesorgt dasz die Verdienste\nvon H.

Coda: The Michelson-Morley Experiment. In concluding this account of\nthe history of special relativity, I return to its origins. I even do not remember if I knew of\nit at all when I wrote my first paper on the subject (1905).\nJust over twenty years before Einstein wrote this late letter, just under twenty\nyears after his creation of the special theory, he gave a lecture at Oxford entitled\n'On the Method of Theoretical Physics' [E20], in the course of which he said, 'It\nis my conviction that pure mathematical construction enables us to discover the\nconcepts and the laws connecting them, which give us the key to the understanding\nof the phenomena of Nature.\nStepping beyond the edge of history, I offer the thought that, just barely visible,\nthe origins of Einstein's later attitude toward the discovery of concepts by purely\nmathematical thinking may go back to 1905.

Both effects had been calculated by Einstein in 1915. There follow papers by Dyson and Crommelin, the astronomers, by Jeans,\nLorentz, Lodge, and Eddington, the physicists, and by Hermann Weyl, the math-\nematician.7\n178 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\noriginal manuscript is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City\nand in what follows is referred to as the Morgan manuscript. At one point he explains how in 1907 the\npreparation of a review article led him to ask in what way the Newtonian theory\nof gravitation would have to be modified in order that its laws would fit special\nrelativity. 'When, in 1907,1 was working on a comprehensive paper on the special\ntheory of relativity for the Jahrbuch der Radioaktivitdt und Elektronik, I had also\nto attempt to modify the Newtonian theory of gravitation in such a way that its\nlaws would fit in the [special relativity] theory.\nThe experimentally known matter independence of the acceleration of fall is\ntherefore a powerful argument for the fact that the relativity postulate has to\nbe extended to coordinate systems which, relative to each other, are in non-\nuniform motion.\nLet us now turn to Section V of Einstein's 1907 review article [E3], received\nby the editor on December 4 of that year. It is here that he begins the long road\nfrom the special theory to the general theory of relativity. Let us follow him on\nthat road, marked by trials, by errors, and by long pauses, until finally, on Novem-\nber 25, 1915, the structure of the general theory as we now know it lay before\nhim.\n*At this point, the original text contains a few words which Einstein clearly had forgotten to delete.\nTHE HAPPIEST THOUGHT OF MY LIFE' 179\nI mentioned in Chapter 7 the contributions Einstein made to special relativity\nafter the completion of his September 1905 paper on that subject.\nHis first important paper on relativity theory after 1905 is the 1907 review. On\nSeptember 25, 1907, Einstein had accepted this invitation [E4]. Since this second part contains the remarks on\ngravitation, it seems most probable that Einstein's 'happiest thought' came to him\nsometime in November 1907. It impelled\nme toward a theory of gravitation. [II]\nWas Einstein first drawn to gravitation because he wanted to include it in spe-\ncial relativity or because he saw that he could extend special relativity with its\nhelp. That is also Einstein's own recollection, again found in\nthe Kyoto lecture: 'In 1907, while I was writing a review of the consequences of\nspecial relativity . I realized that all the natural phenomena could be discussed\nin terms of special relativity except for the law of gravitation. I suspected that\nthis relationship was inexplicable by means of special relativity' [II]. The absence\nof the equation for the static Newtonian gravitational potential $:\n(where p is the matter density and G the Newtonian gravitational constant) in the\n1907 review indicates that the generalization of this equation to special relativity\nwas not his ultimate purpose. 'Is it conceivable that the principle of relativity\nalso holds for systems which are accelerated relative to each other.' That is Ein-\nl8o RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nstein's starting question, 'which must occur to everyone who has followed the\napplications of the relativity principle. A\nreference frame E, is accelerated in the x direction with a constant acceleration\n7. A second frame E2 is at rest in a homogeneous gravitational field which imparts\nan acceleration \u20147 in the x direction to all objects. This assumption extends the principle of relativity to the case\nof uniformly accelerated motion of the reference frame. He did not raise the question\nof the further extension to nonuniform acceleration until 1912, the year he first\nreferred to his hypothesis as the 'equivalence principle' [E7],\n2. Many textbooks on relativity ascribe to Ein-\nstein the method of calculating the red shift by means of the Doppler effect of light\nfalling from the top to the bottom of an upwardly accelerating elevator. It deserves particular mention\nbecause it contains the germ of two ideas that were to become cornerstones of his\nfinal theory: the existence of local Lorentz frames and the constancy of the velocity\nof light for infinitesimally small paths.\nOne easily sees that, given all the assumptions, the influence of relative displace-\nment, relative velocity, and acceleration on the relative rates of the clocks in E and\nS' are all of second or higher order. Therefore, 'the principle of the constancy of the light velocity can\nbe . But then (by special relativity)\nthey are not synchronous relative to S' and thus, by (I), not synchronous relative\nto each other.]\nEinstein at once turned to the physics of Eq.\nIndomitably Einstein goes on. The other is the galley proof of Appendix II, 'Generalized Theory of Grav-\nitation,' which appeared first in the 1950 edition of his The Meaning of Relativity.\nThis review does not have the perfection of the 1905 paper on special relativity. The conclusion about the bending of light is\nqualitatively correct, quantitatively wrong\u2014though, in 1907, not yet logically\nwrong. Einstein was the first to realize this, in 1915. On\nDecember 24, Einstein wrote to Conrad Habicht:\nAt this time I am [again] busy with considerations on relativity theory in con-\nnection with the law of gravitation.

Only two years later, he realized that the extension of the principle of\nspecial relativity demanded a reevaluation of the validity of this most precious tool. Not so Einstein.

It was there that on December 21,\n1908, the next main academic event in the Einstein family took place.\nThe topic of Einstein's second course, the theory of radiation, was also the sub-\nject of his Habilitationsschrift: 'Consequences for the Constitution of Radiation of\nthe Energy Distribution Law of Blackbody Radiation' [F3]. Suffice it\nto say here that they are Einstein's most important contributions in the period\nfrom 1908 to 1911.\nMeanwhile Einstein had obtained his first faculty post, associate professor of the-\noretical physics at the University of Zurich. The proposal to the faculty written by Alfred\nKleiner clearly shows Einstein's rapidly growing renown: 'Today Einstein ranks\namong the most important theoretical physicists and has been recognized rather\ngenerally as such since his work on the relativity principle .\nEinstein must have been aware of this appreciation.'\nl86 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\ntherefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to be a Jew.\nThe secret faculty vote of March 1909 on the Einstein appointment was ten in\nfavor, one abstention.

On December 11, 1909, he gave, for the first but not the last time in his\nlife, an inaugural address, this one entitled 'On the Role of Atomic Theory in the\nNew Physics.\nIn his Zurich period, from October 1909 to March 1911, Einstein published\neleven papers on theoretical physics, including the one on critical opalescence. Einstein acted as the referee for this thesis, which was accepted by the faculty on December\n21, 1909 [Dl]. Einstein' [HI]. Einstein followed the further development with\nlively interest [E6].)\nEinstein and his family moved to Prague in March 1911. Three and a Half Years of SUence\nEinstein first stated the equivalence principle in 1907. In 1915 he presented the\ngeneral theory of relativity as we now know it. This much I learned long ago from\nPauli's encyclopedia article, and also that Einstein arrived at his final version\n'nach langen Irrwegen,' after having followed wrong tracks for a long time [P2].\nI therefore imagined an Einstein engrossed in his new ideas of 1907 and laboring\nunremittingly from 1907 until 1915 to incorporate into a full-fledged theory the\ngeneralization from invariance under uniform motion to invariance under general\nmotion.\nl88 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nhis first contacts with larger segments of the physics community. Yet, I think, all this has little if anything to do with Einstein's\nsilence on gravitation. There were the papers with\nLaub on special relativity, the papers with Hopf on classical radiation theory, and\nthe difficult paper on critical opalescence.\nThere is, of course, nothing unusual about the fact that Einstein did not publish\nanything new about gravitation between 1908 and 1911.\nMore curious is the fact that he twice gave surveys of relativity theory without\nmentioning gravitation or the equivalence principle and its remarkable implica-\ntions: the red shift and the bending of light. The first of these surveys was his\nreport at the Salzburg conference, which included a survey of relativity theory, 'of\nthe consequences of which I would like to mention only a single one' [E3] (namely,\nE = me2), but quantum theory rather than relativity theory was the main issue. Even the special theory was still so new that it may have\nseemed advisable to confine the explications to the case of uniform relative motion. It would\nnot in the least have been out of style for Einstein to write to one of his friends:\nI am preoccupied with the gravitation problem, it mystifies me and I am not get-\nting anywhere. Yet, as far as I\nknow, in his scientific correspondence during this period, mention is made only\nonce of gravitation and the related new issues. These same letters also made clear\nto me the reason for Einstein's silence on the equivalence principle and its con-\nsequences: it was not gravitation that was uppermost in his mind.\nSome examples may show the intensity of Einstein's concern with quantum\nphysics during that period. To Stark,\nJuly 1909: 'You can hardly imagine how much trouble I have taken to invent a\nsatisfactory mathematical treatment of the quantum theory' [E10]. To Besso,\nNovember 1909: 'Reflected little and unsuccessfully about light-quanta' [Ell].\nIn the summer of 1910 Einstein wrote to Laub about his long review article\n[E8]: '[This paper] contains only a rather broad expose of the epistemological\nfoundations of the relativity theory' [El5]. This would have been as good an\noccasion as any to reflect on the new epistemology of the equivalence principle,\nbut Einstein does not do so.\nOne month later, in June 1911, he was back to gravitation theory. my paper [of 1907]. [E20]**\nThat isolated remark, important as it is, does not change my opinion that Einstein\nwas concentrating in other directions during this period. In later years, Einstein\nhimself tended to be uncommunicative about his thoughts on gravitation during\n*Ich will sehen ob ich dieses Lieblingsei doch nicht ausbriiten kann.\n**See also [S5], I shall return in the next chapter to the influence of the problem of rotating bodies\non Einstein's thinking.\n190 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat time. In the Gibson lecture on the origins of the general theory of relativity,\ngiven in Glasgow in June 1933, he says,\n'If [the equivalence principle] was true for all processes, it indicated that the\nprinciple of relativity must be extended to include nonuniform motions of the\ncoordinate systems if one desired to obtain an unforced and natural theory of\nthe gravitational field. His final autobiographical sketch, written a few\nmonths before his death, contains the following statement: 'From 1909 to 1912,\nwhile I had to teach theoretical physics at the universities of Zurich and Prague,\nI puzzled incessantly about the problem [of gravitation]' [E23].\nIn sharp contrast, from then until 1916 there are only a few minor papers on the\nquantum theory while his correspondence shows clearly that now the theory of\ngravitation is steadily on his mind.

Its later editions contain contribu-\ntions to relativity theory by Lorentz, Minkowski, Einstein, and Weyl. However, a frag-\nment could easily have been included, especially since one of Lorentz's papers does\nappear in abridged form. A second shortcoming of the book is the absence of the\nbrief Section V of Einstein's 1907 article [E9]. Either this piece should have been\nincluded along with his 1911 article or else both should have been omitted, since\nthe finer points of the 1911 paper cannot be understood without the approxima-\ntions he had used in 1907.\nIn the 1911 paper Einstein cautioned his readers, 'Even if the theoretical foun-\ndation is correct, the relations derived here are valid only in first approximation,'\nbut did not add an explicit statement about the nature of this approximation. Prior to Einstein's involvement with gravitation, each\none of his papers is transparent and self-contained (with the possible exception of\nhis earliest writing on the foundations of statistical mechanics) though his readers\nmay occasionally have to go to some effort to realize that.\nTurning to the first of the Prague papers, I should evidently begin with the\napproximations to which Einstein referred. Thus in\n1911 the three coordinate systems S, Z, and S' discussed in Chapter 9 reappear.*\nRecall that Z is in constant acceleration relative to S and that the inertial frame\nS' is at one, and only one, time coincident with Z.\nIn 1911 the four main issues were the same as in 1907: the equivalence prin-\nciple, the gravity of energy, the red shift, and the bending of light. Einstein first reminds the reader of the\nequivalence of Newton's mechanical laws in both frames. Thus in 1911 we discern the first glimpses of the new Einstein\nprogram: to derive the equivalence principle from a new theory of gravitation.\nThis cannot be achieved within the framework of what he called the ordinary\nrelativity theory, the special theory. Therefore one must look for a new theory not\nonly of gravitation but also of relativity. 'Of course, one cannot replace an arbitrary gravita-\n*In the 1911 paper, Einstein denotes the frames S, E, and S' by K, K', and K0, respectively.\n196 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\ntional field by a state of motion without gravitational field, as little as one can\ntransform to rest by means of a relativity transformation all points of an arbitrarily\nmoving medium.' This statement would continue to be true in the ultimate general\ntheory of relativity.\nTHE GRAVITY OF ENERGY; THE RED SHIFT\nIn 1907 Einstein had noted that an electromagnetic field is the source not only of\ninertial energy but also of an equal amount of gravitational energy (Chapter 9). Einstein could therefore use\na result of his 1905 paper on special relativity [E10]: the energy \u00a3, arriving at S,\nis larger than E2:\nTHE PRAGUE PAPERS 197\nNow go to the frame S with its gravitational field.\nNext Einstein treated the red shift in a similar way. First, Einstein derives Eq. However, it was Einstein's style forever\nto avoid the quantum theory if he could help it\u2014as in the present case of the\nenergy and the frequency shift.\nSecond, in good texts on general relativity the red shift is taught twice. In a first\ngo-around, it is noted that the red shift follows from special relativity and the\n198 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nequivalence principle only. All this should be remembered in order to grasp better\nEinstein's plight in 1911. He knows that special relativity is to be incorporated\ninto a more profound theory, but he does not know yet how to do that. Taken in that sense, Einstein's remarks on the red shift and the deflection\nof light had given direction to the phenomenology of general relativity even before\nthat theory existed. Also in that sense Einstein had con-\ntributed by his re-analysis of simultaneity in 1905. In 1907 the study of the Max-\nwell equations in accelerated frames had taught him that the velocity of light is\nno longer a universal constant in the presence of gravitational fields.' The\napparent trouble lay not with the number of periods but with the second: one must\nexamine with the greatest care what one means by the rate of clocks in an inho-\nmogeneous gravitational field. This demands an understanding of the following\nthree facts of time. One must first construct 'gleich beschaffene Uhren,' iden-\ntically functioning clocks, to use Einstein's language. One will find (Einstein asserts) that i\u00bb(l,l) = v(2,2), 'the fre-\nquency is independent of where the light source and the [local] clock are placed. In other words, as a result of the transport to places of\ndifferent gravitational field strength, clocks become 'verschieden beschaffen,' dif-\nferently functioning. 'In this theory the\nprinciple of the constancy of light velocity does not apply in the same way as in\n. the usual relativity theory. From a simple application of Huyghens' principle,\nEinstein finds that this ray when going to 'infinity' has suffered a deflection a\ntoward the source given (in radians) by\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M the mass of the source, A the distance\nof closest approach, and c the (vacuum) light velocity.\n200 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nA as 7 X 10'\u00b0 cm, M \u00ab 2 X 1033 g, and a = 0.87 (Einstein found (K'83). Shortly after\nhe completed the paper discussed above, he wrote to Laub:\nThe relativistic treatment of gravitation creates serious difficulties.\nIn 1911 Einstein did not know of Soldner's work. The latter's paper was in fact\nentirely unknown in the physics community until 1921. In that turbulent year,\nLenard, in one of his attempts to discredit Einstein, reproduced part of Soldner's\npaper in the Annalen der Physik [L2], together with a lengthy introduction in\nwhich he also claimed priority for Hasenohrl in connection with the mass-energy\nequivalence. Einstein in No Man's Land\nAnother eight months passed before Einstein made his next move in the theory of\ngravitation. As to Einstein's contribution, drivel it was not.\nThen, in rapid succession, Einstein readied two papers on gravitation, one in\nFebruary 1912 [E16] and one in March 1912 [E17] (referred to in this section as\nI and II, respectively). In 1907 and 1911 Einstein had stretched the kine-\nmatic approach to gravitation to its limits.\nThese are also the last papers in which time is warped but space is flat.\n2O2 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nAll the same, Einstein continued to adhere to flat space.' The sequence\nof these remarks may lead one to surmise that the celebrated problem of the rigid\nbody in the special theory of relativity stimulated Einstein's step to curved space,\nlater in 1912.\nEinstein begins by reminding the reader of his past result that the velocity of\nlight is not generally constant in the presence of gravitational fields:\nA. this result excludes the general applicability of the Lorentz\ntransformation. Earlier he had said (I paraphrase), 'Let us see\nhow far we can come with Lorentz transformations.\nLet us next unveil Einstein's first dynamic Ansatz for a theory of gravitation,\nto which he was led by Eq. He begins by again comparing a homogeneous\nfield in the frame S(x,y,z,t) with the accelerated frame E(\u00a3,77,fVr). In the frame S, the\nlight velocity is taken equal to unity. This motion (Einstein finds) is given by\nwhere v2 = ~x2.12 to special relativistic point mechanics [P3],\nwhere, of course, c in Eq.13 is the usual constant light velocity in vacuum.\nEinstein was stirred by the fact that Eqs. 'Also, here it is seen\u2014as was shown for the usual relativity theory by\nPlanck\u2014that the equations of analytical mechanics have a significance which far\nexceeds that of the Newtonian mechanics.'\nIt is hard to doubt that this insight guided Einstein to the ultimate form of the\nmechanical equations of general relativity, in which Eq.

I\ndecided against that, however, because I already knew that gravitation would have\nto lead me beyond the Lorentz transformations. I had not lost my faith\nin the special theory of relativity either, but I believed that that theory was likewise\nincomplete. I knew I had to start\nall over again, as it were, in constructing a theory of gravitation. That, too, seens to me to be a naive theory, and I think people should\ntry to start all over again, first reconsidering the nonrelativistic theory, just as I\ndid for gravitation in Prague.\nThe inclusion of electromagnetism forced Einstein to generalize the meaning of\np in Eq.\nIt had been a grave decision to make this last modification of the c-field equa-\ntion, Einstein wrote, 'since [as a result] I depart from the foundation of the uncon-\nditional equivalence principle.\n206 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nLet us summarize the Prague papers.* By the spring of 1912, Einstein knew\nof the red shift and the deflection of light.

He mentioned the Nordstrom and the Einstein-Grossmann\ntheories, remarked that the former is simpler and more plausible but does not shed\nany light on the relativity of nonuniform motion, and expressed the hope that the\nbending of light (present in the Einstein-Grossmann theory, absent in the Nord-\nstrom theory) would soon lead to an experimental choice between these two\npossibilities.\nThe Einsteins left Zurich in late March 1914. Einstein accepted. On April 26,\n1914, his first newspaper article appeared, entitled 'Vom Relativitatsprinzip,'\nAbout the relativity principle [E10]. Its last paragraph begins with the question, 'Is the\n[special] relativity theory sketched above essentially complete or does it represent\nonly a first step of a farther-reaching development.' Einstein remarked that the\nsecond alternative appeared to him to be the correct one but added that 'on this\npoint, the views even of those physicists who understand relativity theory are still\ndivided.'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].' Then he went on to relativity\ntheory and observed that the special theory 'is not fully satisfactory from the the-\noretical point of view because it gives a preferred position to uniform motion.'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article.\n242 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe personality can unfold itself in the freest possible way.' Then he, too, addressed\nthe question of the preferred uniform motions in the special theory. 'In my opin-\nion, one could just as well take the opposite view [of Einstein's] and look upon the\npreferred position of uniform motion as precisely a very important and valuable\ncharacteristic of the theory'.' Planck ended by expressing the hope that the expedition planned to\nobserve the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, would provide information about the\nbending of light predicted (not yet correctly) by Einstein. During\nthis period, he completed the general theory of relativity, found the correct values\nfor the bending of light and the displacement of the perihelion of Mercury, did\npioneering work on cosmology and on gravitational waves, introduced his A and\nB coefficients for radiative transitions, found a new derivation of Planck's radia-\ntion law\u2014and ran into his first troubles with causality in quantum physics.\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity. We are in the fall of 1914, at which time Einstein wrote a long\npaper for the proceedings of the Prussian Academy [El6]. He\nalso shows that his earlier results about the red shift and the bending of light (still\nthe old value, off by a factor of 2) are contained in the tensor theory [E20]. As a\nfinal positive result, an important comment about the character of space-time\nshould be mentioned, which (to my knowledge) he makes here for the first time:\n'According to our theory, there do not exist independent (selbstandige) qualities\nof space' [E21].\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. Now, late in 1914, Einstein reproduced this same argument in his\nlong paper. In the 1914\npaper he returned to the division of space-time into two domains L, and L2, as\ndescribed in Section 12d. In 1914 not only did he have some wrong physical ideas\nabout causality but in addition he did not yet understand some elementary math-\nematical notions about tensors [HI]. In the course of 1915 he realized, however, that this\n'argument for the determination of the Lagrange function of the gravitational field\nwas entirely illusory, since it could easily be modified in such a way that [this\nLagrangian] .\nThe mathematical details of the October 1914 paper are of no interest for the\nunderstanding of the evolution of the general theory and will be omitted. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. 'It is remarkable\nhow little my colleagues are susceptible to the inner need for a real relativity the-\nory.\nIn summary, toward the end of 1914 Einstein could look back on a year which\nhad brought major changes to his personal life and his professional career. He\nwas still essentially alone in his convictions about the future of relativity theory\nand confused about some of its crucial features. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. Toward the\nautumn of 1915 he finally realized* that his theory up until then was seriously\nwrong in several respects.\nMeanwhile, early in 1915 he did not publish anything substantially new on\nrelativity.** He did write two review articles, one on relativity theory [Ell] and\none on the atomic theory of matter [E29], and a short paper on the statistical\nproperties of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium [E30].f In\nAugust 1913, when Lorentz sent congratulations to Einstein on his forthcoming\nappointment in Berlin, he must have added (the letter is lost) a query concerning\nde Haas, as is seen from Einstein's reply: 'At present, I do not know what to do\nin the matter of your son-in-law, since in Berlin I will have neither an institute\nnor an assistant.\nEinstein was now in a position to do something for de Haas\u2014and for Lorentz.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5].\n246 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof the existence of Ampere's molecular currents* (explanation of para- and fer-\nromagnetism) . However, in the pre-spin days of 1915, any dynamic theory of ferromag-\nnetism had necessarily to be incorrect.\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned.ff The\ntheoretical derivation by Einstein in 1915 had already been given in 1907 by\nOwen Willans Richardson, who had also tried in vain to observe the rotation by\nmagnetization, at Palmer Laboratory in Princeton [R1J-H In 1909 Samuel Jack-\nson Barnett, then at Tulane University, began the study of the inverse effect, mag-\nnetization by rotation, now known as the Barnett effect. I shall next outline the\nEdH work of 1915 and then state the interesting results obtained by Barnett at\nabout the same time [B2]. All three papers appeared\nin 1915.\n1[For some years after 1915, the effect was called the Einstein-Richardson effect.\n248 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof a wire.\nLet us now return to our main topic, Einstein's final formulation of his theory\nof general relativity.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. A week later, he wrote to Sommerfeld about a tentative plan to write a\nshort treatise on relativity which was to be oriented toward a general theory of\nrelativity [E39]. But on November 7 he wrote to Hilbert, 'I realized about four\nweeks ago that my methods of proof used until then were deceptive' [E40], and\non October 12, to Lorentz, 'In my paper [of October 1914, [E16]], I carelessly\n(leichtsinnig) introduced the assumption that [the gravitational Lagrangian] is an\ninvariant for linear transformations' [E41]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. All\nthese statements taken together convince me that Einstein still believed in the 'old'\ntheory as late as July 1915, that between July and October he found objections\nto that theory, and that his final version was conceived and worked out between\nlate October and November 25. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44].' (It should be said that in matters of science a heavy heart never lasted\nvery long for Einstein.\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations. Einstein did not say all this explic-\nitly in his paper. Einstein still subscribes to the demands of\nunimodular invariance and \\/g = 1 \u2022 On the basis of this 'most radical relativity\ntheory,' he presents two of his greatest discoveries [E48].\nEinstein's discovery resolved a difficulty that was known for more than sixty\nyears.\nOn September 12, 1859, he submitted to the Academy of Sciences in Paris the text\n254 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof a letter to Herve Faye in which he recorded his findings [L2]. The experimental number quoted\nby Einsteintf on November 18, 1915, was 45\" \u00b1 5 [E48]. Two\nkinds of modifications from Newton's law were considered: a slightly different,\npurely static law [O3] or a 1/r2 law corrected with velocity-dependent terms [Zl]\n(Lorentz's theory of gravitation mentioned in Chapter 13 belongs to this last cat-\negory).\na) Einstein started from his field equations\nr^ = 0 (14. And so, one\nweek before the general theory of relativity was complete, Einstein obtained for\nthe precession per revolution: 247T3a2/7\"V(l \u2014 e2), which yields 43\"/century (a\n= semimajor axis, T = period of revolution, e = eccentricity; see [W6] for the\nrelation between this result and modern experiment).\nd) Two months later, on January 16, 1916, Einstein read a paper [S4] before\nthe Prussian Academy on behalf of Karl Schwarzschild, who was in the German\narmy at the Russian front at that time. On February 24, 1916,\nEinstein read another paper by Schwarzschild [S5], this one giving the solution\nfor a mass point in the gravitational field of an incompressible fluid sphere. The calculations of the week before remain\nunaffected:\nAny physical theory that obeys special relativity can be incorporated into the\ngeneral theory of relativity; the general theory does not provide any criterion\nfor the admissibility of that physical theory. Finally the general theory of\nrelativity is closed as a logical structure.9 arose because in the November 4 paper Einstein had redefined his\n*Einstein inserted those gf, into gf,dx\"dx' = 0 and then applied Huyghens\" principle.3) in such a way that the conservation laws read\nOn November 28, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld that three years earlier he and\nGrossmann had considered Eq.*\nOn June 20, 1933, Einstein, exiled from Germany, gave a lecture at the Uni-\nversity of Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of relativity. I believe that [my paper] contains simultaneously the solution\nof the problems of Einstein and of Mie. It was\nmeant to be a theory of everything but gravitation.\nf Mie's ideas on gravitation were referred to in Chapter 13.\n258 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nlends an exalted quality to his paper, from the title, 'Die Grundlagen der Physik,'\nThe Foundations of Physics, to the concluding paragraph, in which he expressed\nhis conviction that his fundamental equations would eventually solve the riddles\nof atomic structure. In December 1915, Einstein remarked that Hilbert's com-\nmitment to Mie's theory was unnecessary from the point of view of general rela-\ntivity [E53]. Justified though these criticisms are, Hilbert's paper nevertheless\ncontains a very important and independent contribution to general relativity: the\nderivation of Eq.16) if /= R,\nbut in 1915 that was not yet clear. In this observation I see the simple and\nvery surprising solution of the problem of Riemann, who was the first to seek\ntheoretically for the connection between gravitation and light.\nI must return to Einstein and Hilbert, however.* The subject was general relativity. From\nthe period in which Einstein lectured, it is clear that his subject was the imperfect\ntheory described in his paper of October 1914. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915. Between November\n7 and 25, Einstein, otherwise a prolific letter writer, did not correspond with any-\none\u2014except Hilbert (if the Einstein archive in Princeton is complete in regard to\nthat period).\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E. Apparently Einstein has received a copy of Hilbert's\nwork.\nLet us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. In May 1916\nEinstein gave a colloquium on Hilbert's work in Berlin [E61].** In May\n1917 he told a student from Goettingen, 'It is too great an audacity to draw\nalready now a picture of the world, since there are still so many things which we\ncannot yet remotely anticipate' [S6], an obvious reference to Hilbert's hopes for a\nunification of gravitation and electromagnetism. Einstein, PAW, 1915, p.

In the previous chapter, Einstein's role\nin the further development of this theory and its impact on later generations of\nphysicists were discussed. In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin. To begin with, I retur\nto the days just after November 1915, when Einstein completed his work on the\nfoundations of general relativity. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect. He also completed his first semipopular book\non relativity.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI]. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN. Lorentz' [L2].\nLet us briefly recapitulate Einstein's progress in understanding the bending of\nlight. He\nis still too close to Newton, who believed that space is flat and who could have\nhimself computed the 0*87 (now called the Newton value) from his law of grav-\nitation and his corpuscular theory of light. Several years pass before he understands that the curvature\nof space modifies the bending of light. 1915. The member of the Prussian Acad-\nemy discovers that general relativity implies a bending of light by the sun equal\nto 1 \"74, the Einstein value, twice the Newton value. This factor of 2 sets the stag\nfor a confrontation between Newton and Einstein. Frustration continued also after\nNovember 18, 1915, the day on which Einstein announced the right bending of\n1''74 [E30]. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].\nEnglish interest in the bending of light developed soon after copies of Einstein's\ngeneral relativity papers were sent from Holland by de Sitter to Arthur Stanley\nEddington at Cambridge (presumably these were the first papers on the theory to\nreach England). So did a subsequent\nreport by Eddington [E33], who in a communication to the Royal Astronomical\nSociety in February 1917 stressed the importance of the deflection of light [E34].\nIn March 1917 the Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Watson Dyson, drew attention\nto the excellence of the star configuration on May 29, 1919, (another eclipse date)\nfor measuring the alleged deflection, adding that 'Mr Hinks has kindly under-\ntaken to obtain for the Society information of the stations which may be occupied'\n[Dl]., the Newton value]; or they may confirm Einstein's weird theory of non-\nEuclidean space; or they may lead to a result of yet more far-reaching conse-\nquences\u2014no deflection' [E35].

Then\ncame November 6, 1919, the day on which Einstein was canonized.\nA very definite result has been obtained, that light is deflected in accordance with\nEinstein's law of gravitation.' A few weeks later he added, 'The deflection of light by matter,\nsuggested by Newton in the first of his Queries, would itself be a result of first-\nrate scientific importance; it is of still greater importance when its magnitude sup-\nports the law of gravity put forward by Einstein' [Tl].\n*Silberstein, a native of Poland who moved to England and later settled in the United States, was\nthe author of three books on relativity. On several occasions, he was in dogged but intelligent oppo-\nsition to relativity theory.\n306 THE LATER JOURNEY\nOn October 22, Carl Stumpf, a psychologist and fellow member of the Prussian\nAcademy, wrote to Einstein, 'I feel compelled to send you most cordial congratu-\nlations on the occasion of the grandiose new success of your gravitation theory. On November 7, 1919, the Einstein legend\nbegan. The next day, the\nsame paper published a further article on the same subject headlined 'The revo-\nlution in science/Einstein v. In his lucid way, Lorentz explained general relativity\nto the readers of the Niewe Rotterdamsche Courant of November 19, remarking\nthat 'I cannot refrain from expressing my surprise that according to the report in\nthe [London] Times there should be so much complaint about the difficulty of\nunderstanding the new theory. It is evident that Einstein's little book \"About the\nSpecial and General Theory of Relativity in Plain Terms\" did not find its way\ninto England during wartime. An article by Alexander Moszkowski entitled 'Die Sonne bracht' es an den Tag' in\nthe Berliner Tageblatt of October 8, 1919, must presumably have been based on information from\nEinstein himself.IN\nNEW THEORY OF THE\nUNIVERSE.\nNEWTONIAN IDEAS\nOVERTHROWN.\nThe greatest possible interest had been\naroused in scientific circles by the hope that\nrival theories of a fundamental physical\nproblem would bo put to the test, and there was\na very large attendance of astronomers and\nphysicists.

However, the weekly\nBerliner Illustrierte Zeitung of December 14 carried a picture of Einstein on its\ncover with the caption 'A new great in world history: Albert Einstein, whose\nresearches, signifying a complete revolution in our concepts of nature, are on a\npar with the insights of a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton.' As far as I know,\nthe first news in the Swiss papers is found in the Neue Zuricher Zeitung of\nDecember 10, where it is reported that the astronomer Henri Deslandres gave an\naccount of the May 29 observations before the December 8 session of the French\nAcademy of Sciences in which he summarized Einstein's theory by saying that\nenergy attracts energy.' Referring to an earlier\ndescription of him in the London Times, he concluded his article as follows: 'By\nan application of the theory of relativity to the tastes of readers, today in Germany\nI am called a German man of science and in England I am represented as a Swiss\nJew. The best description I know of Einstein in 1919 is the\nphotograph on the cover of the Berliner Illustrirte, a picture of an intelligent,\nsensitive, and sensuous man who is deeply weary\u2014from the strains of intense\nthinking during the past years, from illnesses from which he has barely recovered,\nfrom the pain of watching his dying mother, and, I would think, from the com-\nmotion of which he was the center (See Plate II).\nNovember 1919 was not the first time Einstein and relativity appeared in the\nnews. Frank recalls having seen in 1912 a Viennese newspaper with the headlines\n'The minute in danger, a sensation of mathematical science' [F2], obviously a\nreference to the time dilation of special relativity. In 1914 Einstein himself had\nwritten a newspaper article on relativity for Die Vossische Zeitung [E38]. For\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 309\nexample, The New York Times Index contains no mention of him until November\n9, 1919. Thus the birth of the Einstein legend can be pinpointed at Novem-\nber 7, 1919, when the London Times broke the news. more probable, however, that this often-quoted statement indeed origi-\nnated with Einstein himself and was made sometime in 1916, when he published\na pamphlet (with Earth in Leipzig) and a 'popular' book on relativity (with\nVieweg in Braunschweig).'

On\nAugust 24, 1920, a newly founded organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft\ndeutscher Naturforscher, organized a meeting in Berlin's largest concert hall for\nthe purpose of criticizing the content of relativity theory and the alleged tasteless\npropaganda made for it by its author.* Einstein attended. Einstein and Lenard were present.\nInvited by the College de France, Einstein went to Paris in March 1922 to\ndiscuss his work with physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 317\nindividual [E48].*\nEvidently Einstein's life and moods were strongly affected by the strife and\nviolence in Germany in the early 1920s. There came a time when Einstein had to pay.\n*In 1927, Einstein, Curie, and Lorentz prepared a report for the committee, dealing with an inter-\nnational bureau of meteorology [E52]. All the papers Einstein published before finishing his\nwork on the formulation of general relativity deal either directly with research or\nwith reviews of research, with minor exceptions: a note in honor of Planck written\nin 1913 [E53] and reviews of booklets on relativity by Brill and by Lorentz\n[E53a]. From 1916 to 1920\nwe find the early eulogies\u2014to Mach, Schwarzschild, Smoluchowski, Leo Arons\u2014\nand a few more reviews of others' work\u2014of Lorentz's Paris lectures [E54], of\nHelmholtz's lectures on Goethe [E55], of Weyl's book on relativity [E56]. The more important of these contributions have been\nreprinted in various collections of Einstein essays.\nAfter 1920 Einstein wrote fairly often on scientific personalities.\nEinstein had a lifelong interest in philosophy. His philosophical interests are also manifest in his\nreview of Emile Meyerson's La Deduction Relativiste [E76] and his introductions\nto books by Planck [E77] and Frank [E78].' Elsewhere Einstein wrote of Maxwell, 'Imagine his feelings when the dif-\nferential equations he had formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields\nspread in the form of polarized waves and with the speed of light. With the formulation of the field equations of grav-\n32O THE LATER JOURNEY\nitation in November 1915, classical physics (that is, nonquantum physics) reached\nits perfection and Einstein's scientific career its high point. Despite much illness, his years\nfrom 1916 to 1920 were productive and fruitful, both in relativity and in quantum\ntheory. It is my\nimpression that, after 1916, Einstein finally had some energy to spare for the\nworld in which he lived. That line was written only\nmonths before the discovery of quantum mechanics, the time at which a younger\ngeneration of physicists took over the lead while Einstein went his own way.\nI return to Einstein's physics. I deal with Einstein's work on unified field\ntheory first, since it is a direct outgrowth of general relativity, the last scientific\ntopic treated before the present long digression on the suddenly famous Doctor\nEinstein. Then I turn to Einstein and the quantum theory, begining once again\nwith events in the year 1905 and continuing from there until his final days.

Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. Laub published on special relativity as early as 1907\n[LI].* In 1910, Laub wrote the first major\nreview article on the experimental basis of special relativity [L3].

The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-\neral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21].

In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.* Einstein acknowledged Miintz's work in two papers on distant\nparallelism [E31, E33]. In Feb-\nruary 1930 they published their first joint paper, on static solutions of the distant\nparallelism theory [E34]. In October\nEinstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which\na new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-\ntime continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point\n[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. It deals with semi-vectors and spinors\n[E38] and was the last paper published by Einstein in the Sitzungsberichte of the\nPreussische Akademie. The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922.

During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. In\n1936 they published a note on the general relativistic two-body problem [E51] and\nin 1937 a paper on cylindrical gravitational waves [E52].\nIn the course of working on this last problem, Einstein believed for some time\nthat he had shown that the rigorous relativistic field equations do not allow for the\nexistence of gravitational waves [II, S2].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. In 1929 Hoffmann\nstarted work on projective relativity with Veblen. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. Einstein wrote an introduction\nto Bergmann's textbook on relativity [E65]. Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]\non relativity theory. 1922, Munich.

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al]. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. Theoretical physics. Theoretical physics. Lorentz, Nernst, Planck; (Kamerlingh Onnes). Work of a more speculative nature, theoretical physics. Theoretical physics. Mathematical physics. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize. In all three instances, his sole motivation was relativity (until further\nnotice, relativity shall refer to the special theory). In 1910 he wrote that relativity\nwas the most far-reaching new concept since the discovery of the energy principle\n[Ol]. On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3].\nAt issue was the verification of Einstein's relation between the rest mass, the\nenergy, and the velocity of a free electron. As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation. Thus, one important confirmation of relativity became noncontro-\nversial only after the 1912 nominations had been made. Sommerfeld's theory of\nthe fine structure of spectral lines, in which essentially the same Einstein relation\nis used, also came later, in 1916. By then, the momentous new development of\ngeneral relativity had drastically changed the situation. In the Report for 1910, it was suggested that\none should wait for further experimental verification 'before one can accept the\n[relativity] principle and in particular award it a Nobel prize. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. Einstein was deeply\nimmersed in the struggle with general relativity and was confusing everybody,\nincluding himself, with his hybrid theory in which everything was covariant\nexcept the gravitational field equations. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special\nand general relativity. Haas proposed\nEinstein for the new theory of gravitation, quoting the explanation of the peri-\nhelion precession of Mercury. Warburg nominated him for his work in quan-\ntum theory, relativity theory, and gravitation. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\n1919.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2].\n1920. Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation.' Lorentz was deeply impressed by the results\nof the 1919 eclipse expeditions.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. As early as 1917 Einstein had pointed out that Gehrcke's\ntheory is based on contradictory assumptions [E4]. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics.\nAt this point, the Committee requests that its member Allvar Gullstrand pre-\npare an account of the theory of relativity and that its member Arrhenius do the\nsame for the photoeffect.\nGullstrand's report, highly critical of relativity, was not a good piece of work.' Also beside\nthe mark is his finding about the general theory: 'As Gullstrand has shown, the\nsituation is that it remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein\ntheory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion experiment [. He also expressed the opinion (more reasonable though not very\nweighty) that other, long-known deviations from the pure two-body Newtonian\nlaw should be re-evaluated with general relativistic methods before there could be\neven an attempt to identify the residual effect to be explained.\nThe Committee asks Gullstrand for an additional report on relativity and\nOseen for a report on the photoeffect.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein.\n'Gullstrand had never published on relativity before that time. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. It is understandable that the Academy was in no\nhurry to award relativity before experimental issues were clarified, first in special\nrelativity, later in general relativity.

Progress\nwas slow in the next forty years, as demonstrated by a question raised by Samuel\nPierpont Langley in a lecture given in 1885 before the AAAS meeting in Ann\nArbor: 'Does [the] ultimate wavelength of 2.

The next candidate was\nPlanck, to whom the offer of extraordinarius (associate professor) was made.\nPlanck accepted and was soon promoted to full professor.\nPlanck most probably* discovered his law in the early evening of Sunday,\nOctober 7. Rubens and his wife had called on the Plancks on the afternoon of that\nday. In the course of the conversation, Rubens mentioned to Planck that he had\nfound p(v, 7) to be proportional to T for small v. Planck went to work after the\nvisitors left and found an interpolation between this result and Wien's law, Eq. Expressed in notations introduced by Planck\ntwo months later, he proposed that\nwhich is indeed correct in the quantum regime hv/kT 3> 1, a condition that is\nwell satisfied in Paschen's experiment mentioned earlier (hv/kT ~ 15 for T =\n1000 K and X = 1 /urn).\nIt would do grave injustice to Planck if I left the reader with the impression\nthat Planck's discovery was exclusively the result of interpolating experimental\ndata. I must refrain from discussing Planck's\nearlier research (cf. However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life.\n*Here I rely on the obituary of Rubens by Gerhard Hettner [HI], himself an experimental expert\non blackbody radiation. Hettner's account differs slightly from the recollections that Planck himself\nwrote in his late eighties [P2].6 contains Wien's law of 1896:\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 369\nEven if Planck had stopped after October 19, he would forever be remembered\nas the discoverer of the radiation law. This concerns a result Planck had obtained some\ntime earlier [P5]. This\nyields\nThis equation for the joint equilibrium of matter and radiation, one of Planck's\nimportant contributions to classical physics, was the starting point for his discovery\nof the quantum theory. As we soon shall see, this same equation was also the point\nof departure for Einstein's critique in 1905 of Planck's reasoning and for his quan-\ntum theory of specific heats. Planck concluded from Eq. I should rather say, what Planck held to be a statistical\nstep.\nFrom the point of view of physics in 1900 the logic of Planck's electromagnetic\nand thermodynamic steps was impeccable, but his statistical step was wild.\nIn 1931 Planck referred to it as 'an act of desperation. In Planck's opin-\nion, 'the electromagnetic theory of radiation does not provide us with any starting\npoint whatever to speak of such a probability [ WN] in a definite sense' [PI].\nHowever, let us leave aside for the moment what Planck did not do or what he\nmight have done and return to his unorthodox handling of Boltzmann's principle.\nIn his papers, Planck alluded to the inspiration he had received from Boltzmann's\nstatistical methods. The corresponding\ncounting problem, discussed previously in Section 4b, has nothing to do with\nPlanck's counting of partitions of indistinguishable objects, the energy elements. Planck himself knew that and said so.\n[P7]**\nThus the only justification for Planck's two desperate acts was that they gave him\nwhat he wanted. It cast Planck, con-\nservative by inclination, into the role of a reluctant revolutionary. Although there have been other major innovations in\nphysics since December 1900, the world has not seen since a figure like Planck.\nFrom 1859 to 1926, blackbody radiation remained a problem at the frontier of\ntheoretical physics, first in thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the\nold quantum theory, and finally in quantum statistics. As Pringsheim put it in\na lecture given in 1903, 'Planck's equation is in such good agreement with exper-\niment that it can be considered, at least to high approximation, as the mathemat-\nical expression of Kirchhoff's function' [P8]. In 1901 Planck obtained from the available data the value\nh = 6. At the time of Planck's\n*In January 1905 and again in January 1906, Planck proposed Boltzmann for the Nobel prize.\n**The interesting suggestion has been made that Planck may have been led to Eq.3 X 10~10 [R3] was it realized how good Planck's value\nfor e was.\nFrom the very start, Planck's results were a source of inspiration and bewil-\nderment to Einstein. Addressing Planck in 1929, he said 'It is twenty-nine years\nago that I was inspired by his ingenious derivation of the radiation formula which\n. In 1913,\nEinstein wrote that Planck's work 'invigorates and at the same time makes so\ndifficult the physicist's existence.\nFrom my discussions with Einstein, I know that he venerated Planck as the\ndiscoverer of the quantum theory, that he deeply respected him as a human being\nwho stood firm under the inordinate sufferings of his personal life and of his coun-\ntry, and that he was grateful to him: 'You were the first to advocate the theory of\nrelativity' [El]. In 1918 he proposed Planck for the Nobel prize.* In 1948, after\nPlanck's death, Einstein wrote, 'This discovery [i. Nothing further\nhappened in quantum physics after 1901 until Einstein proposed the light-quan-\ntum hypothesis. Einstein on Planck: 1905.\nThe Rayleigh-Einstein-Jeans Law\nThe first sentence on the quantum theory published by Einstein was written in\nthe month of March, in the year 1905.

But what was the meaning of Planck's\nderivation of that equation. The first of these was the Planck equation (Eq.16)\nwhere R is the gas constant, N Avogadro's number, and R/N (= k) the Boltz-\nmann constant (for a number of years, Einstein did not use the symbol k in his\npapers).\n'If Planck had drawn this conclusion, he would probably not have made his\ngreat discovery,' Einstein said later [E3]. Planck had obtained Eq. Dur-\ning the 1890s, Planck had made several errors in reasoning before he arrived at\nhis radiation law, but none as astounding and of as great an historical significance\nas his fortunate failure to be the first to derive Eq. This omission is no\ndoubt related to Planck's decidedly negative attitude (before 1900) towards Boltz-\nmann's ideas on statistical mechanics. It contains for the\nfirst time the suggestion to apply to radiation 'the Maxwell -Boltzmann doctrine\nof the partition of energy' (i.\nThus the experimentalists close to Planck were well aware of Rayleigh's work.\nOne wonders whether or not Planck himself knew of this important paper, which\nappeared half a year before he proposed his own law. Whichever may be the case,\nin 1900 Planck did not refer to Rayleigh's contribution. From 1900 to 1905, Planck's radiation formula\nwas generally considered to be neither more nor less than a successful represen-\ntation of the data (see [Bl]). Only in 1905 did it begin to dawn, and then only on\n* Planck derived his radiation law in a circuitous way via the equilibrium properties of his material\noscillators.

The physicist of 1905 could take or leave the\nlight-quantum hypothesis as nothing more than a curious property of pure radia-\ntion in thermal equilibrium, without any physical consequence.\nI shall leave Einstein's applications of the heuristic principle to Section 19e and\nshall describe next how, in 1906, Einstein ceased assiduously avoiding Planck's\nequation (Eq. Einstein on Planck: 1906\nIn 1906 Einstein returned once more to Planck's theory of 1900. Now he had\nmuch more positive things to say about Planck's radiation law. This change in\nattitude was due to his realization that 'Planck's theory makes implicit use of the\n. Einstein's reconsideration of Planck's reason-\ning and of its relation to his own work can be summarized in the following way:\n1. Planck had used the p- U relation, Eq. Planck had introduced a quantization related to U, namely, the prescription\nU = Phv/N(sce Eqs. Einstein had introduced a quantization related to p: the light-quantum hypoth-\nesis. The question arises of whether a connection can be established between\nPlanck's quantization related to U and Einstein's quantization related to p. He then re-examined the derivation of\nPlanck's law with the help of this new assumption. 'We must consider the following theorem to be the basis of\nPlanck's radiation theory: the energy of a [Planck oscillator] can take on only those\nvalues that are integral multiples of hv; in emission and absorption the energy of\na [Planck oscillator] changes by jumps which are multiples of hv.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions. We shall see in Section\n19f that Planck was not at all prepared to accept at once Einstein's reasoning,\ndespite the fact that it lent support to his own endeavors. As to Einstein himself,\nhis acceptance of Planck's Eq.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves.\n1905: Einstein.

Working with an X-ray tube operated at a constant potential V, they\nfound that the X-ray frequencies produced have a sharp upper limit v given by\neV = hv, as had been predicted by Einstein in 1906. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. He could formulate it clearly\nonly in the domain hv/kT^>\\, where Wien's blackbody radiation law holds.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Yet the resistance to Planck's ideas\u2014while cer-\ntainly not absent\u2014was much less pronounced and vehement than in the case of\nEinstein. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nThis difference in assessment of the two theoretical issues, one raised by Planck,\none by Einstein, is quite evident in the writings of the leading theorists of the day.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9]. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Yet the resistance to the\nideas of Planck and Bohr\u2014while certainly not absent\u2014was much less pro-\nnounced and vehement than in the case of Einstein. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. In the first instance, experi-\nment also set the pace for the acceptance of the Planck formula. At\nthe same time, however, neither Einstein nor any one else denied the fact that\nPlanck's highly nontrivial universal curve admirably fitted the data. When told of the helium/hydrogen ratio, Einstein is\nreported to have said of Bohr's work, 'Then it is one of the greatest discoveries'\n[H6]. Unlike Bohr and Planck, Einstein had to wait a\ndecade before he saw one of his predictions, the linear E-v relation, vindicated,\nas was discussed in the previous section. In\n386 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n1918, Rutherford commented on the Duane-Hunt results, 'There is at present no\nphysical explanation possible of this remarkable connection between energy and\nfrequency' [R7].

It is remarkable that the old quantum theory would orig-\ninate from the analysis of a problem as complex as blackbody radiation.\nConsider a body in thermal equilibrium with radiation. Let the radiation\nenergy which the body absorbs be converted to thermal energy only, not to any\nother energy form. Thus J(v, T) is the emissive\npower of a blackbody. He also gave an operational definition for a system, the\n'Hohlraumstrahlung,' which acts as a perfect blackbody: 'Given a space enclosed\nby bodies of equal temperature, through which no radiation can penetrate, then\nevery bundle of radiation within this space is constituted, with respect to quality\nand intensity, as if it came from a completely black body of the same temperature. Experimentalists had to cope with three\nmain problems: (1) to construct manageable bodies with perfectly black properties,\n(2) to devise radiation detectors with adequate sensitivity, and (3) to find ways of\nextending the measurements over large frequency domains. A quarter of a century passed\nbefore the next theoretical advance in blackbody radiation came about.\nIn 1879 Josef Stefan conjectured on experimental grounds that the total energy\nradiated by a hot body varies with the fourth power of the absolute temperature\n[SI].4)This law was the very first thermodynamic consequence derived from Maxwell's\ntheorem, according to which the numerical value of the radiation pressure equals\none third of the energy per unit volume.

This is one of the arguments which led Einstein in\n1909 to summarize his view on the status of the radiation theory in the following\nway.*\nI already attempted earlier to show that our current foundations of the radiation\ntheory have to be abandoned. Spontaneous and Induced Radiative Transitions\nAfter 1909 Einstein continued brooding about the light-quantum for almost\nanother two years.\nIn 1916, he returned once again to blackbody radiation and made his next\nadvance. In November 1916 he wrote to Besso, 'A splended light has dawned on\nme about the absorption and emission of radiation' [E8]. His\nmethod is based on general hypotheses about the interaction between radiation\nand matter. No special assumptions are made about intrinsic properties of the\nobjects which interact with the radiation.)\nEinstein considered a system consisting of a gas of his molecules interacting\nwith electromagnetic radiation.\nThe B terms refer to induced emission and absorption. By this\nremarkable reasoning, Einstein therefore established a bridge between blackbody\nradiation and Bohr's theory of spectra. It was via the analysis of statistical fluctuations of blackbody radiation\nthat Einstein eventually came to associate a definite momentum with a light-quan-\ntum.17 would lead Einstein to\nstate, in 1909, the 'momentum quantum postulate': monochromatic radiation of\nlow density behaves in regard to pressure fluctuations as if it consists of mutually\nindependent momentum quanta of magnitude hv/' c.\nWhat he did say was, 'If the radiation were to consist of very few extended\ncomplexes with energy hv which move independently through space and which\nare independently reflected\u2014a picture that represents the roughest visualization\nof the light-quantum hypothesis\u2014then as a consequence of fluctuations in the\nradiation pressure there would act on our plate only such momenta as are repre-\nsented by the first term of our formula [Eq.\nThe photon momentum made its explicit appearance in that same year, 1909. In other\nwords, what is the Brownian motion of molecules in the presence of radiation.16, he\nhad to invoke a condition of directedness: 'if a bundle of radiation causes a mole-\ncule to emit or absorb an energy amount hv, then a momentum hv/c is transferred\nto the molecule, directed along the bundle for absorption and opposite the bundle\nfor [induced] emission' [El 1].8) requires that the radiation be fully directed (this is often called\nNadelstrahlung).\nTHE PHOTON 411\nBesso about the needle rays, he wrote, 'Damit sind die Lichtquanten so gut wie\ngesichert' [E13]. That is, in a spontaneous radiative transition, the molecule suf-\nfers a recoil hv/c. A spontaneous emission coefficient was in\nfact first introduced by Rutherford in 1900 when he derived** the equation dN\n= \u2014\\Ndt for the decrease of the number N of radioactive thorium emanation\natoms in the time interval dt [R2].* The quality of the experiment is well demonstrated by the value\nhe obtained for the Compton wavelength: h/mc \u00ab 0. A year after Compton's experiments, Einstein\nwrote a popular article for Berliner Tageblatt, which ends as follows: 'The posi-\ntive result of the Compton experiment proves that radiation behaves as if it con-\nsisted of discrete energy projectiles, not only in regard to energy transfer but also\nin regard to Stosswirkung (momentum transfer)' [E24]. Compton, Phys.), Compton Scattering.", "Theoretical_Physics_1905": " Orderly Transitions and Revolutionary Periods\nIn all the history of physics, there has never been a period of transition as abrupt,\nas unanticipated, and over as wide a front as the decade 1895 to 1905. The birth of quan-\ntum theory (1900) and relativity theory (1905) marked the beginning of an era in\nwhich the very foundations of physical theory were found to be in need of revision.\nTwo men led the way toward the new theoretical concepts: Max Karl Ernst Lud-\nwig Planck, professor at the University of Berlin, possessed\u2014perhaps obsessed\u2014\nby the search for the universal function of frequency and temperature, known to\nexist since 1859, when Gustav Robert Kirchhoff formulated his fundamental law\nof blackbody radiation (19a)*; and Albert Einstein, technical expert at the Swiss\npatent office in Bern, working in an isolation which deserves to be called splendid\n(3).\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 27\nand discipline; I believe entirely wrongly so. To this end, it will be\nhelpful to recall a distinction which he liked to make between two kinds of physical\ntheories [E2].' Then Einstein went on to say,\n'The theory of relativity is a theory of principle.)\nThus, toward the end of the decade 1895-1905 a new theory of principle had\nemerged: special relativity. What was the status of quantum theory at that time.\nThe discovery of the quantum theory in 1900 (19a) and of special relativity in\n1905 (7) have in common that neither was celebrated by press releases, dancing\nin the streets, or immediate proclamations of the dawn of a new era. All the rest was application of these theoretical principles.\nBy contrast, the 'old' quantum theory, developed in the years from 1900 to\n1925, progressed by unprincipled\u2014but tasteful\u2014invention and application of ad\nhoc rules rather than by a systematic investigation of the implications of a set of\naxioms. It is remarkable that the old quantum theory would orig-\ninate from the analysis of a problem as complex as blackbody radiation. From\n1859 until 1926, this problem remained at the frontier of theoretical physics, first\nin thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the old quantum theory,\nand finally in quantum statistics;\nEinstein's 1905 equation for the energy E of photoelectrons liberated from a\nmetallic surface irradiated by light of frequency v (19e), the oldest equation in the\nquantum theory of the interaction between radiation and matter;\nEinstein's 1906 equation for the specific heat c, of one gram-atom of an idealized\ncrystalline solid, in which all lattice points vibrate harmonically with a unique\nfrequency v around their equilibrium positions (R is the gas constant) (20), the\noldest equation in the quantum theory of the solid state; and\nthe equation given in 1913 by Niels Bohr, the oldest equation in the quantum\ntheory of atomic structure. Long before anyone knew what the principles of the\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 2Q\nquantum theory were, the successes of equations like these made it evident that\nsuch a theory had to exist.\nThe old quantum theory spans a twenty-five-year period of revolution in phys-\nics, a revolution in the sense that existing order kept being overthrown.

By then the revolutionary period of\nthe old quantum theory\u2014which coincided exactly with the years of Einstein's\nhighest creativity.\u2014had made way for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (and\nthe beginning of its relativistic extension), a theory which by 1929 was recognized\nby nearly everyone as a new theory of principle.\nIn the same speech in 1929, he also said, 'I admire to the highest degree the\nachievements of the younger generation of physicists which goes by the name\nquantum mechanics and believe in the deep level of truth of that theory; but I\nbelieve that the restriction to statistical laws will be a passing one. As I shall discuss in (27), the answer has to do with a grand\ndesign which Einstein conceived early, before the discovery of quantum mechanics,\nfor a synthetic physical theory. It was to be a theory of particles and fields in\nwhich general relativity and quantum theory would be synthesized.\nThe phenomena to be explained by a theory of principle have become enor-\nmously richer since the days when Einstein made the first beginnings with his\nprogram. I have often wondered what might have been his\nreactions to these discoveries, given his 'conviction that pure mathematical con-\nstruction enables us to discover the concepts and the laws connecting them' [E7].

In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. In Feb-\nruary 1930 they published their first joint paper, on static solutions of the distant\nparallelism theory [E34].

The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen. In\n1936 they published a note on the general relativistic two-body problem [E51] and\nin 1937 a paper on cylindrical gravitational waves [E52]. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15.

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].

In 1910 he wrote that relativity\nwas the most far-reaching new concept since the discovery of the energy principle\n[Ol]. As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation. In the Report for 1910, it was suggested that\none should wait for further experimental verification 'before one can accept the\n[relativity] principle and in particular award it a Nobel prize. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C.\n1919. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] .\n1920. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity. As early as 1917 Einstein had pointed out that Gehrcke's\ntheory is based on contradictory assumptions [E4]. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Gullstrand was a member of the Committee for physics from 1911 to 1929,\nits chairman from 1923\"to 1929.*\nThe main points of Arrhenius's report were first, that a prize for quantum\ntheory had just been given (Planck, 1918) and second, that it would be preferable\nto give an award to experimentalists if the photoeffect were to be honored.\nNo prize for physics was given that year.\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nOseen, the theoretical physicist, gives an excellent analysis of Einstein's paper\nof 1905 on the light-quantum as well as of his work in 1909 on energy fluctuations\nin blackbody radiation.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.\nThat is how Einstein got the Nobel prize 'for his services to theoretical physics\nand especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was. Einstein's paper\non that subject was the first application of quantum theory to systems other than\npure radiation.

Orderly Transitions and Revolutionary Periods\nIn all the history of physics, there has never been a period of transition as abrupt,\nas unanticipated, and over as wide a front as the decade 1895 to 1905. The birth of quan-\ntum theory (1900) and relativity theory (1905) marked the beginning of an era in\nwhich the very foundations of physical theory were found to be in need of revision.\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 27\nand discipline; I believe entirely wrongly so. What was the status of quantum theory at that time.\nThe discovery of the quantum theory in 1900 (19a) and of special relativity in\n1905 (7) have in common that neither was celebrated by press releases, dancing\nin the streets, or immediate proclamations of the dawn of a new era.\nBy contrast, the 'old' quantum theory, developed in the years from 1900 to\n1925, progressed by unprincipled\u2014but tasteful\u2014invention and application of ad\nhoc rules rather than by a systematic investigation of the implications of a set of\naxioms. Nor should one underestimate the tremendous, highly\nconcrete, and lasting contributions of the conquistadores, Einstein among them,\nwho created the old quantum theory. It is remarkable that the old quantum theory would orig-\ninate from the analysis of a problem as complex as blackbody radiation. From\n1859 until 1926, this problem remained at the frontier of theoretical physics, first\nin thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the old quantum theory,\nand finally in quantum statistics;\nEinstein's 1905 equation for the energy E of photoelectrons liberated from a\nmetallic surface irradiated by light of frequency v (19e), the oldest equation in the\nquantum theory of the interaction between radiation and matter;\nEinstein's 1906 equation for the specific heat c, of one gram-atom of an idealized\ncrystalline solid, in which all lattice points vibrate harmonically with a unique\nfrequency v around their equilibrium positions (R is the gas constant) (20), the\noldest equation in the quantum theory of the solid state; and\nthe equation given in 1913 by Niels Bohr, the oldest equation in the quantum\ntheory of atomic structure. Long before anyone knew what the principles of the\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 2Q\nquantum theory were, the successes of equations like these made it evident that\nsuch a theory had to exist.\nThe old quantum theory spans a twenty-five-year period of revolution in phys-\nics, a revolution in the sense that existing order kept being overthrown.\nIt was quite otherwise with quantum theory. Nor did\nit take long (only five years) before the connection between Planck's quantum\nformula (Eq. Only after the discov-\neries of quantum mechanics, quantum statistics, and quantum field theory did\nEqs. Thus the births of the relativities were\norderly transitions, the days of the old quantum theory were a revolutionary\nperiod.)\nNo one appreciated the marked differences between the evolution of relativity\nand quantum theory earlier and better than Einstein, the only man who had been\ninstrumental in creating both.\nEarly in 1905 he wrote a letter to a friend in which he announced his forth-\ncoming papers on the quantum theory and on special relativity.\nRegarding Einstein's judgment of his own role in quantum physics, there is\nfirst of all his description of his 1905 paper 'On a heuristic point of view concern-\ning the generation and transformation of light' as very revolutionary (19c). Next\nwe have his own summary: 'What I found in the quantum domain are only occa-\nsional insights or fragments which were produced in the course of fruitless strug-\ngles with the grand problem.\nRELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY 31\nthe Planck medal from Planck's own hands. By then the revolutionary period of\nthe old quantum theory\u2014which coincided exactly with the years of Einstein's\nhighest creativity.\u2014had made way for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (and\nthe beginning of its relativistic extension), a theory which by 1929 was recognized\nby nearly everyone as a new theory of principle.\nIn the same speech in 1929, he also said, 'I admire to the highest degree the\nachievements of the younger generation of physicists which goes by the name\nquantum mechanics and believe in the deep level of truth of that theory; but I\nbelieve that the restriction to statistical laws will be a passing one.\nFar more fascinating to me than the substance of Einstein's critique of quantum\nmechanics\u2014to be discussed in detail in (26)\u2014is the question of motivation. As I shall discuss in (27), the answer has to do with a grand\ndesign which Einstein conceived early, before the discovery of quantum mechanics,\nfor a synthetic physical theory.

He was likewise prepared\nfor the survival of the practical successes of quantum mechanics, with perhaps\nonly small modifications. [E2]\n(2) One should not try to find the new theory by beginning with quantum\nmechanics and trying to refine or reinterpret it:\nI do not believe that quantum mechanics will be the starting point in the search\nfor this basis, just as one cannot arrive at the foundations of mechanics from\nthermodynamics or statistical mechanics. [E2]\n(3) Instead\u2014and this was Einstein's main point\u2014one should start all over\nagain, as it were, and endeavor to obtain the quantum theory as a by-product of\na general relativistic theory or a generalization thereof. He was going to\ndo that again for the quantum theory, and never mind the time it might take.\n462 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIt was a solitary position.\nEinstein's apartness in regard to the foundations of quantum physics predates\nthe discovery of quantum mechanics.\nSo it was in the days of the old quantum theory. So it remained after quantum\nmechanics came along. I should now be more precise and add\nthat this opinion of his applied exclusively to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nI know from experience how difficult it was to discuss quantum field theory with\nhim. Valentin Bargmann has told me that at one time Einstein asked him for a\nprivate survey of quantum field theory, beginning with second quantization. In the time capsule of Section 2b, I inserted the comment that\nto this day the synthesis of quantum theory and general relativity is beset with\nconceptual difficulties. the constructions of his\n464 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nimagination appear so necessary and so natural that he is apt to treat them not as\nthe creations of his thoughts but as given realities' [E4]. However, Einstein continued,\nthis method cannot be applied to quantum problems without further ado.\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 465\nOverdetermination was and remained Einstein's hope for an answer to the\nquantum problem. Here I add a\nfew remarks on the quantum aspects. statistical\n[quantum] theory .\n466 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nForever and in vain, Einstein kept looking for hints that would help him realize\nhis vision of a quantum theory derived from a unified field theory. This urge\nexplains his reference to the quantum theory at unexpected places. the quantum\ntheory' [E28]. In 1930\nhe gave a lecture on unified field theory, a report of which contains the statement,\n'He emphasized that he is in no way taking notice of the results of quantum cal-\nculations because he believes that by dealing with microscopic phenomena these\nwill come out by themselves' [E30]. A report in 1931 by Einstein on a five-dimen-\nsional theory which should unify gravitation and electromagnetism ends, 'This\ntheory does not yet contain the conclusions of the quantum theory' [E31]. One phrase in this paper, 'one does not see\na priori whether the theory contains the quantum phenomena' illustrates once\nagain the scope of the program that was on Einstein's mind. Gravitation and electromagnetism were not synthesized,\nquantum physics was not integrated, satisfactory particle-like solutions were not\nfound.\n'The theory of relativity and the quantum theory .\n468 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEinstein kept thinking about quantum theory until the very end.

Ulm, March 15,1879. Today, the merchant Her-\nmann Einstein, residing in Ulm, Bahnhofstrasse 135, of the Israelitic faith, per-\nsonally known, appeared before the undersigned registrar, and stated that a child\nof the male sex, who has received the name Albert, was born in Ulm, in his res-\nidence, to his wife Pauline Einstein, nee Koch, of the Israelitic faith, on March\n14 of the year 1879, at 11:30 a. There may never have been a human\nbeing to whom Einstein felt closer than his sister Maja (as she was always called).\nHermann Einstein, an unruffled, kind-hearted, and rather passive man, loved\nby all acquaintances [R3], was fond of literature and in the evenings would read\nSchiller and Heine aloud to his family [R4]. Einstein und Co.\nThus Einstein spent his earliest years in a warm and stable milieu that was\nalso stimulating. This episode came\nto an abrupt end when Einstein had a tantrum and threw a chair at the woman\nwho taught him. He gave Einstein popular books on science to\nread and, later, the writings of Kant. A book he wrote con-\ntains recollections of his early acquaintance with Einstein [Tl]. Einstein also continued to study mathematics on his own. Einstein was\ntaught the elements of Judaism at home by a distant relative [M5]. As a result of\nthis inculcation, Einstein went through an intense religious phase when he was\nabout eleven years old.\nThere is another story of the Munich days that Einstein himself would occa-\nsionally tell with some glee. Einstein\nreplied that he had done nothing wrong.\nThe preceding collection of stories about Einstein the young boy demonstrates\nthe remarkable extent to which his most characteristic personal traits were native\nrather than acquired. However, in his personal and scientific conduct, he was not a\nrebel, one who resists authority, nor\u2014except once*\u2014a revolutionary, one who\n'Einstein's one truly revolutionary contribution is his light-quantum paper of 1905.\nAnother and most important characteristic of Einstein is already evident in the\nchild quietly at play by itself: his 'apartness.\nIn October 1895 Einstein went to Zurich to take the ETH examination. For\nJost Winteler, one of his teachers and a scholar in his own right, Einstein devel-\noped great respect, for Frau Winteler a deep affection.

Throughout his student years, from 1896 to 1900, Einstein lived on\nan allowance of one hundred Swiss francs per month, of which he saved twenty\neach month to pay for his Swiss naturalization papers. The Einsteins moved back to Milan and\nbegan anew.\nEinstein's student days did have their pleasant moments.\n42 INTRODUCTORY\nEinstein's essay written in Aarau, for which he received the grade 3 to 4 (out of 6).\nPORTRAIT OF THE PHYSICIST AS A YOUNG MAN 43\n44 INTRODUCTORY\n'Most of the time I worked in the physical laboratory, fascinated by the direct\ncontact with observation,' Einstein later wrote about his years at the ETH [E7]. In particular, Einstein was not allowed to con-\nduct an experiment on the earth's movement against the aether [R8].* At one\npoint Weber is supposed to have said to Einstein: 'You are a smart boy, Einstein,\na very smart boy. Einstein's fascination with experiment must have been dampened.\nEinstein, in turn, was not impressed with Weber's physics courses. These few-month periods were made easy for Einstein\nbecause Marcel Grossmann made available his lecture notes, beautifully written,\nmeticulously organized.\n**For a complete list of Einstein's four-year curriculum, see [S7].\nfit is of interest for Einstein's later work on general relativity that he also attended some of Geiser's\nlectures on differential geometry [Kl, RIO).\n$1 have not found any evidence for the correspondence between Boltzmann and Einstein referred to\nin [M9] and [S9]. And so,\nin August 1900, Einstein became qualified as a Fachlehrer, together with three\nother students, who each immediately obtained positions as assistants at the ETH\n[S5].* Einstein himself was jobless.\nEarly in 1901 Einstein again tried to find a university position. I would have found one long ago if Weber had not played\na dishonest game with me' [E14]4 In March 1901 he sent a reprint of his first\npaper to Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig, along with a letter in which he\ninquired 'whether you perhaps might have use for a mathematical physicist who\nis familiar with absolute measurements' [El5]. The\nyear after that Ostwald would be the first to propose Einstein for the Nobel\nprize.\n**After Weber's death in 1912, Einstein wrote to a friend, in a way quite uncommon for him,\n'Weber's death is good for the ETH' [E10].'\n\u00a7The letters from the Einsteins to Ostwald have been reproduced in [K2].\n46 INTRODUCTORY\nFinally Einstein found a temporary job. Here is Einstein writing in Decem-\nber 1901: 'Since September 15, 1901, I am a teacher at a private school in\nSchaffhausen. This work was not\naccepted as a thesis, however, f This setback was the last one in Einstein's career. Einstein was deeply grate-\nful for this recommendation4 There the matter rested until December 11, 1901,\nwhen a vacancy at the patent office was advertised in the Schweizerisches Bundes-\nblatt. Einstein at once sent a letter of application [E20]. One of his students described him as follows: 'about five feet ten,\nbroad-shouldered, slightly stooped, a pale brown skin, a sensuous mouth, black\nmoustache, nose slightly aquiline, radiant brown eyes, a pleasant voice, speaking\n*In this same letter, Einstein also reported that he had met one of the leading German physicists.\nfl have been unable to find a response from Zurich concerning Einstein's proposed thesis. Earlier in the year, Einstein had contemplated sub-\nmitting an extended version of his first paper, on intermolecular forces, as a PhD thesis [E14]. Einstein, Solovine, and another friend, Konrad Habicht, met regularly to\ndiscuss philosophy, physics, and literature, from Plato to Dickens.*\nMeanwhile, Einstein's appointment by the Swiss federal council came through. In 1902 there was tem-\nporary friction between Einstein and his mother, who neither then nor later liked\nMileva [E23]. Hermann Einstein died on October 10,\n1902, and was buried in Milan.\nEinstein did well at the patent office. There was always enough time and energy left for his own\nphysics.\nNo one before or since has widened the horizons of physics in so short a time\nas Einstein did in 1905. His work of that year will of course be discussed at length\n*In his late sixties, Einstein remembered the days 'when we ran our happy \"Academy,\" which after\nall was less childish than those respectable ones which I got to know later from close in' [E22].\nOn April 1, 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical expert second class with\na salary raise to SF 4500. At the end of 1907 Einstein made\nthe first important strides toward the general theory of relativity (see Chapter 9). Einstein's days in Bern are not\nyet over, but a new phase is about to begin: his academic career (see further Sec-\ntion lOa).\nAt the end of his life, Einstein wrote that the greatest thing Marcel Grossman\ndid for him was to recommend him to the patent office with the help of the elder\nGrossman [E26]. Einstein's funds may have been limited,\nhis marriage may not have been perfect.\nAn Addendum on Einstein Biographies\nIn preparing this chapter, I have striven to rely as much as possible on original\ndocuments.

'Planck had asked him what he was working on,\nand Einstein described general relativity as it was then.\nEinstein reacted rapidly and positively to the approach from Berlin.\n239\n240 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe ETH shows that he had acted as Korreferent* for four theses, all in experi-\nmental physics, but had not taken on PhD students in theoretical physics.\nEncouraged by Einstein's response, Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg\njoined in signing a formal laudatio, the statement supporting a proposal for mem-\nbership, which was presented to the academy on June 12, 1913 [Kl]. A number of arrangements remained to be worked out,\nbut already in July 1913 Einstein wrote to a friend that he was going to be in\nBerlin by the spring of 1914 [E2].\nIn a letter [K3] sent to the academy on December 7, 1913, Einstein formally\naccepted membership and declared that he wished to begin his new position in\nApril 1914. On February 9, 1914, he gave a farewell talk before the Physical\nSociety of Zurich, in which he noted that 'we have progressed as little in the theory\nof gravitation as the physicists of the eighteenth century when they knew only\nCoulomb's law' [E6]. He mentioned the Nordstrom and the Einstein-Grossmann\ntheories, remarked that the former is simpler and more plausible but does not shed\nany light on the relativity of nonuniform motion, and expressed the hope that the\nbending of light (present in the Einstein-Grossmann theory, absent in the Nord-\nstrom theory) would soon lead to an experimental choice between these two\npossibilities.\nThe Einsteins left Zurich in late March 1914. Soon after Mileva's arrival, the Einsteins separated. Einstein never put all the blame for\nthat on Mileva. Einstein saw them off at the station. In later\ntimes, after Einstein's remarriage, the sons would visit and stay with their father\nin Berlin.\nBy the time Einstein arrived in Berlin, he was already a man of great renown,\nthough not yet the stellar figure he was to become five years later. Einstein accepted. On April 26,\n1914, his first newspaper article appeared, entitled 'Vom Relativitatsprinzip,'\nAbout the relativity principle [E10].' Einstein remarked that the\nsecond alternative appeared to him to be the correct one but added that 'on this\npoint, the views even of those physicists who understand relativity theory are still\ndivided.'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].' Then he went on to relativity\ntheory and observed that the special theory 'is not fully satisfactory from the the-\noretical point of view because it gives a preferred position to uniform motion.'\nPlanck replied [PI], welcoming Einstein and remarking, 'I know you well\nenough to dare say that your real love belongs to that direction of work in which\n*' .'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article.\n242 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe personality can unfold itself in the freest possible way. 'In my opin-\nion, one could just as well take the opposite view [of Einstein's] and look upon the\npreferred position of uniform motion as precisely a very important and valuable\ncharacteristic of the theory'. However, one must side with Planck when he courteously\nand justly chided Einstein, noting that in the latter's general theory not all coor-\ndinate systems are on an equal footing anyway, 'as you yourself have proved only\nrecently.' Planck ended by expressing the hope that the expedition planned to\nobserve the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, would provide information about the\nbending of light predicted (not yet correctly) by Einstein.\nEinstein's productivity was not affected by the deep troubles of the war years,\nwhich, in fact, rank among the most productive and creative in his career. During\nthis period, he completed the general theory of relativity, found the correct values\nfor the bending of light and the displacement of the perihelion of Mercury, did\npioneering work on cosmology and on gravitational waves, introduced his A and\nB coefficients for radiative transitions, found a new derivation of Planck's radia-\ntion law\u2014and ran into his first troubles with causality in quantum physics.\nThis intense scientific activity did not banish from Einstein's mind a genuine\nand intense concern for the tragic events unfolding in the world around him. On\nthe contrary, the period of 1914-18 marks the public emergence of Einstein the\nradical pacifist, the man of strong moral convictions who would never shy away\nfrom expressing his opinions publicly, whether they were popular or not. This appears to be the first political\ndocument to which Einstein lent his name.* It gave him joy to find colleagues\nwho 'stand above the situation and do not let themselves be driven by the murky\n* Einstein on Peace by Otto Nathan and Heinz Norden describes in detail Einstein's political activ-\nities during the First World War [Nl].\nEinstein's initial hopes that the voices of reason might prevail yielded to increas-\ning pessimism as the war dragged on. These feelings of dejection may have been enhanced, I think, by\nEinstein's own illness at that time.\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity. We are in the fall of 1914, at which time Einstein wrote a long\npaper for the proceedings of the Prussian Academy [El6]. Einstein clearly\nfelt the need to explain these techniques in his own way; they were as new to him\nas to most other physicists. First of all, Einstein takes a stand against Newton's argument for the\nabsolute character of rotation (as demonstrated, for example, by Newton's often\nreproduced discussion of the rotating bucket filled with water [Wl]).\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. Now, late in 1914, Einstein reproduced this same argument in his\nlong paper. In 1914 not only did he have some wrong physical ideas\nabout causality but in addition he did not yet understand some elementary math-\nematical notions about tensors [HI].\nThe mathematical details of the October 1914 paper are of no interest for the\nunderstanding of the evolution of the general theory and will be omitted. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. Einstein was grateful for hav-\ning these brought to his attention. 'It is remarkable\nhow little my colleagues are susceptible to the inner need for a real relativity the-\nory.\nIn summary, toward the end of 1914 Einstein could look back on a year which\nhad brought major changes to his personal life and his professional career. He\nwas still essentially alone in his convictions about the future of relativity theory\nand confused about some of its crucial features.\n\"The slight extension of the set of allowed transformations given in the second Einstein-Grossmann\npaper [E23] (Section 12d) must have been found shortly afterward. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. It would be fulfilled before the year was out, but not until Einstein\nhad passed through a crisis followed by an exhausting struggle.\nMeanwhile, early in 1915 he did not publish anything substantially new on\nrelativity.** He did write two review articles, one on relativity theory [Ell] and\none on the atomic theory of matter [E29], and a short paper on the statistical\nproperties of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium [E30]. At that time Einstein made good\nuse of a temporary guest appointment at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsan-\nstalt in Charlottenburg [K4].\nWander Johannes de Haas was a Dutch physicist of Einstein's age.f In\nAugust 1913, when Lorentz sent congratulations to Einstein on his forthcoming\nappointment in Berlin, he must have added (the letter is lost) a query concerning\nde Haas, as is seen from Einstein's reply: 'At present, I do not know what to do\nin the matter of your son-in-law, since in Berlin I will have neither an institute\nnor an assistant.\nEinstein was now in a position to do something for de Haas\u2014and for Lorentz.^\nI do not know when de Haas joined Einstein at the Reichsanstalt.\nSoon after the conclusion of their collaboration, Einstein wrote enthusiastically\nabout the results obtained.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5].\nHOn one occasion, Einstein referred in print to de Haas as Herr de Haas-Lorentz [E32]. Einstein could not know that his theoretical\nprediction was wrong by a factor of about 2. Since Einstein and de Haas claimed\nto have found agreement between theory and experiment, their experiment had\nalso to be wrong by a factor of 2.\nCharacteristically, Einstein was unaware of earlier efforts to measure gyro-\nmagnetic effects until some time after his own work had been completed [E33].\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned.ff The\ntheoretical derivation by Einstein in 1915 had already been given in 1907 by\nOwen Willans Richardson, who had also tried in vain to observe the rotation by\nmagnetization, at Palmer Laboratory in Princeton [R1J-H In 1909 Samuel Jack-\nson Barnett, then at Tulane University, began the study of the inverse effect, mag-\nnetization by rotation, now known as the Barnett effect. I shall next outline the\nEdH work of 1915 and then state the interesting results obtained by Barnett at\nabout the same time [B2]. All three papers appeared\nin 1915.\n1[For some years after 1915, the effect was called the Einstein-Richardson effect.\nIn the model of Richardson and Einstein, the value\nwas obtained by the following reasoning.\nEinstein and de Haas knew well that objections could be raised against this\nderivation. Clearly the proof that\npermanently circulating electrons indeed exist meant far more to Einstein than\nonly the verification of a century-old hypothesis. Later in 1915\nhe wrote, 'As pointed out by Einstein and de Haas, [their] experiments indicate\nvery strongly that electrons can rotate in atoms without emission of energy radia-\ntion' [B3].**\nThe EdH technique for measuring g consisted in analyzing the motion of an\niron cylinder hung vertically (in the z direction; 'up' counted as positive) by means\n'There was still another reason why Einstein attached great significance to the EdH effect, as is\nseen especially clearly in a paper he wrote in May 1915 (E32J: he believed (incorrectly) that the\npersistence of ferromagnetism at zero absolute temperature indicated the existence of a zero point\nenergy of rotation.\n248 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof a wire.*\nEinstein and de Haas took two sets of measurements. I am not aware of a similar confession by Einstein.\nAs to Einstein, his interest in gyromagnetism continued after de Haas's depar-\nture.\nLet us now return to our main topic, Einstein's final formulation of his theory\nof general relativity.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. All\nthese statements taken together convince me that Einstein still believed in the 'old'\ntheory as late as July 1915, that between July and October he found objections\nto that theory, and that his final version was conceived and worked out between\nlate October and November 25. 'That fellow Einstein suits his convenience\n(Es ist bequem mil dem E.\nWhat made Einstein change his mind between July and October. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect. Einstein got rid of all these shortcomings\nin a series of four brief articles. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44].' (It should be said that in matters of science a heavy heart never lasted\nvery long for Einstein.)\nFor the last time, I recall that Einstein and Grossmann had concluded [El7]\nthat the gravitational equations could be invariant under linear transformations\nonly and that Einstein's justification for this restriction was based on the belief\nthat the gravitational equations ought to determine the g^ uniquely, a point he\ncontinued to stress in October 1914 [E16].'\nThe remaining flaw was, of course, Einstein's unnecessary restriction to uni-\nmodular transformations.\u2022\u201e\u201e, $\u201e\u201e correspond to Einstein's G^, Rf,, Sf, in [E44].\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations. Einstein's proof of this last statement is by far the most important\npart of this paper.\nThe phrase italicized in the above quotation shows that Einstein's understand-\ning of general covariance had vastly improved. Einstein did not say all this explic-\nitly in his paper.\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 253\nHe writes the gravitational equations in the form\nwhere R^ is the full Ricci tensor.\nThus there seems to be a contradiction, which Einstein proposed to resolve by\nmeans of 'the hypothesis that molecular gravitational fields constitute an essential\npart of matter.'\nDuring the next two weeks, Einstein believed that his new equation (Eq. Einstein still subscribes to the demands of\nunimodular invariance and \\/g = 1 \u2022 On the basis of this 'most radical relativity\ntheory,' he presents two of his greatest discoveries [E48].' This discovery was, I believe, by far the strongest emo-\ntional experience in Einstein's scientific life, perhaps in all his life.\nEinstein's discovery resolved a difficulty that was known for more than sixty\nyears. The experimental number quoted\nby Einsteintf on November 18, 1915, was 45\" \u00b1 5 [E48].5H\nAgainst this background, Einstein's joy in being able to give an explanation\n'without any special hypothesis' becomes all the more understandable.\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 255\nnicalities of his calculation need not be described in detail since they largely coin-\ncide with standard textbook treatments.\na) Einstein started from his field equations\nr^ = 0 (14. Either way, the answers for the effect are, of course, the same, a fact\nEinstein became aware of in the course of preparing his paper [E50]. Einstein asked for a static isotropic solution\nof the metric (as it is now called [W5]). And so, one\nweek before the general theory of relativity was complete, Einstein obtained for\nthe precession per revolution: 247T3a2/7\"V(l \u2014 e2), which yields 43\"/century (a\n= semimajor axis, T = period of revolution, e = eccentricity; see [W6] for the\nrelation between this result and modern experiment).\nd) Two months later, on January 16, 1916, Einstein read a paper [S4] before\nthe Prussian Academy on behalf of Karl Schwarzschild, who was in the German\narmy at the Russian front at that time. The paper contained the exact solution of\nthe static isotropic gravitational field of a mass point, the first instance of a rigorous\nsolution of Einstein's full gravitational field equations. On February 24, 1916,\nEinstein read another paper by Schwarzschild [S5], this one giving the solution\nfor a mass point in the gravitational field of an incompressible fluid sphere. On June 29,\n1916, Einstein addressed the Prussian Academy [E51] to commemorate\nSchwarzschild, who had died on May 11 after a short illness contracted at the\nRussian front. Einstein devoted only half a page to his\nsecond discovery: the bending of light is twice as large as he had found earlier. The calculations of the week before remain\nunaffected:\nAny physical theory that obeys special relativity can be incorporated into the\ngeneral theory of relativity; the general theory does not provide any criterion\nfor the admissibility of that physical theory.\nIn Section 12d, I mentioned that Einstein did not know the Bianchi identities\n[W8]\nwhen he did his work with Grossmann.\nEinstein's brief belief in Eq.9 arose because in the November 4 paper Einstein had redefined his\n*Einstein inserted those gf, into gf,dx\"dx' = 0 and then applied Huyghens\" principle.3) in such a way that the conservation laws read\nOn November 28, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld that three years earlier he and\nGrossmann had considered Eq.*\nOn June 20, 1933, Einstein, exiled from Germany, gave a lecture at the Uni-\nversity of Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of relativity. Einstein and Hilbert**\nTo repeat, on November 25 Einstein presented his final version (Eq.15) of the\ngravitational equations to the Prussian Academy. Einstein, having\nlearned the hard way from his mistakes a few weeks earlier, left the structure of\nT1\" entirely free, except for its transformation and conservation properties. I believe that [my paper] contains simultaneously the solution\nof the problems of Einstein and of Mie. It was\nmeant to be a theory of everything but gravitation. For a comment by Einstein on Mie's\nelectromagnetic theory, see [E52b].\n258 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nlends an exalted quality to his paper, from the title, 'Die Grundlagen der Physik,'\nThe Foundations of Physics, to the concluding paragraph, in which he expressed\nhis conviction that his fundamental equations would eventually solve the riddles\nof atomic structure. In December 1915, Einstein remarked that Hilbert's com-\nmitment to Mie's theory was unnecessary from the point of view of general rela-\ntivity [E53]. So had Einstein, a few weeks earlier [E44]. In this observation I see the simple and\nvery surprising solution of the problem of Riemann, who was the first to seek\ntheoretically for the connection between gravitation and light.\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 259\ncredited Amalie Emmy Noether (who was in Goettingen in 1915) with the proof\nof the theorem about the four identities; Noether's theorem had meanwhile been\npublished, in 1918 [N4]. By 1924 Lorentz [L4], Felix Klein [K7], Einstein [E55],\nand Weyl [Wll] had also written about the variational methods and the identities\nto which they give rise (see further Section 15c).\nI must return to Einstein and Hilbert, however.* The subject was general relativity. From\nthe period in which Einstein lectured, it is clear that his subject was the imperfect\ntheory described in his paper of October 1914. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915. However, we have Felix Klein's word that, as with Einstein,\nHilbert's decisive thoughts came to him also in the fall of 1915\u2014not in Goettingen\nbut on the island of Rugen in the Baltic [K8].\nThe most revealing source about the crucial month of November is the corre-\nspondence during that period between Einstein and Hilbert. Between November\n7 and 25, Einstein, otherwise a prolific letter writer, did not correspond with any-\none\u2014except Hilbert (if the Einstein archive in Princeton is complete in regard to\nthat period). The whole November correspondence may well have been triggered, it\nseems to me, by Einstein's knowledge that he was not the only one to have found\nflaws in this earlier work of his.\n*Einstein and Hilbert began corresponding at least as early as October 1912, when Einstein was\nstill in Zurich.\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E. Apparently Einstein has received a copy of Hilbert's\nwork.\nLet us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. It is true that Hilbert's paper contains the trace term which Einstein\nhad yet to introduce.* But Einstein's method for doing so was, as mentioned ear-\nlier, the adaptation of a trick he had already used in his paper of November 4.\nThus it seems that one should not attach much significance either to Einstein's\nagreeing with Hilbert 'as far as I can see' or to Hilbert's agreeing with Einstein\n'as it seems to me' [H4]. (I leave aside the characterization of Einstein as a mathema-\ntician, which he never was nor pretended to be. I do believe that Einstein was the sole creator of the\nphysical theory of general relativity and that both he and Hilbert should be cred-\nited for the discovery of the fundamental equation (Eq.\nSomething happened between these two men between November 20 and\nDecember 20, when Einstein wrote to Hilbert, 'There has been a certain pique\nbetween us, the causes of which I do not wish to analyze. I find it hard to believe\nthat Einstein went as far as thinking that Hilbert's Triad to vanish [E59]. Straus wrote to me,\n'Einstein felt that Hilbert had, perhaps unwittingly, plagiarized Einstein's\n[largely wrong. Whatever happened, Einstein and Hilbert\nsurvived. In May 1916\nEinstein gave a colloquium on Hilbert's work in Berlin [E61].** In May\n1917 he told a student from Goettingen, 'It is too great an audacity to draw\nalready now a picture of the world, since there are still so many things which we\ncannot yet remotely anticipate' [S6], an obvious reference to Hilbert's hopes for a\nunification of gravitation and electromagnetism. Einstein was thirty-eight when\nhe said that. Einstein, PAW, 1915, p. Lorentz, August 14, 1913.

In the present chapter, I shall describe how Einstein's position concerning\nquantum mechanics evolved in the course of time. 1925-31: The Debate Begins\nSchroedinger was not the only one who had profited from the study of Einstein's\nthree papers on the new gas theory.\nAlso Einstein himself continued thinking about the meaning of wavefields, old\n440\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 441\nand new. Eugene Wigner, who was in Berlin in 1925, told me that Einstein had\nat that time the idea of wavefields serving as 'Fiihrungsfelder,' guiding fields, for\nlight-quanta or other particles, one field for each particle.\nAs was mentioned earlier, Einstein considered his work on the quantum gas\nonly a temporary digression. During the very early days of quantum mechanics,*\nwe find him 'working strenuously on the further development of a theory on the\nconnection between gravitation and electricity' [E3]. Bose, who visited\nBerlin in November 1925, recalled that 'Einstein was very excited about the ne\nquantum mechanics. It was not Bose but Dirac who answered that question by giving the\ndynamic derivation of expressions for Einstein's A and B coefficients in a paper\nin which he laid the foundations of quantum electrodynamics [Dl]. Einstein's deep interest in quantum mechanics\nmust have led him to write to Heisenberg soon after the publication of the latter's\npaper [H2].** All the letters from Einstein to Heisenberg have been lost. How-\never, a number of letters from Heisenberg to Einstein are extant. (dated November 30, 1925) is clearly in response to an earlier letter from Einstein\nto Heisenberg in which Einstein appears to have commented on the new quantum\nmechanics. I\nfind it remarkable that Einstein apparently sensed that there was some connection\nbetween the BKS theory and quantum mechanics.\n**The two men met for the first time in the spring of 1926. Could Einstein have surmised as early as 1925 that some statistical element\nis inherent in the quantum mechanical description.\nDuring the following months, Einstein vacillated in his reaction to the Heisen-\nberg theory. In view of the scientific links between Einstein's and Schroe-\ndinger's work, it is not surprising that Einstein would express real enthusiasm\nabout wave mechanics: 'Schroedinger has come out with a pair of wonderful\npapers on the quantum rules', he wrote in May 1926 [E10]. [Bl]\nOne month later, Born wrote a more elaborate sequel to this paper, in which he\npointed out that the starting point of his considerations was 'a remark by Einstein\non the relation between [a] wavefield and light-quanta; he [E.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 443\nand spoke in this sense of a \"Gespensterfeld\"', ghost field [B2], clearly a reference\nto Einstein's idea of a Tuhrungsfeld.' Shortly thereafter, Born wrote to Einstein:\nMy idea to consider Schroedinger's wavefield as a 'Gespensterfeld' in your sense\nof the word proves to be more useful all the time. [B3]*\nOnce more, but now for the last time, we encounter Einstein as a transitional\nfigure in the period of the birth of quantum mechanics.** Einstein's position in the\nyears to follow can be summarized succinctly by saying that he took exception to\nevery single statement in Bern's papers and in the letter Born subsequently wrote\nto him.\n'Einstein's verdict . There are other\ninstances as well in which Einstein's reactions were experienced with a sense of\nloss, of being abandoned in battle by a venerated leader. Needless to say, Einstein's reactions affected the older generation more\nintensely than the younger.\nFebruary 1927. In a lecture given in Berlin, Einstein is reported to have said\nthat 'what nature demands from us is not a quantum theory or a wave theory;\nrather, nature demands from us a synthesis of these two views which thus far has\nexceeded the mental powers of physicists' [El2]. At this point in the developments,\nas others are about to take over, it should be recalled one more time that as early\n\"This important letter is not included in the published Born-Einstein correspondence. (In this paper,\nHeisenberg, too, referred to 'Einstein's discussions of the relation between waves\nand light-quanta.') In June 1927 Heisenberg writes a letter to Einstein which\nbegins, 'Many cordial thanks for your kind letter; although I really do not know\nanything new, I would nevertheless like to write once more why I believe that\nindeterminism, that is, the nonvalidity of rigorous causality, is necessary [his ital-\nics] and not just consistently possible' [H7]. This letter is apparently in response\nto another lost letter by Einstein, triggered, most probably, by Heisenberg's work\nin March.1 mention\nits existence at this point only in order to emphasize once again that Einstein did\nnot react to these new developments as a passive bystander. In fact, at just about\nthat time, he was doing his own research on quantum mechanics (his first, I\nbelieve). Heisenberg had heard\nindirectly that Einstein 'had written a paper in which you . Einstein eventually withdrew his paper.\nOctober 1927. As was mentioned in\nChapter 23, Einstein had declined an invitation to give a paper on quantum sta-\ntistics at that conference. All par-\nticipants were housed in the same hotel, and there, in the dining room, Einstein\nwas much livelier. Otto Stern has given this first-hand account**:\n\"This is the title of a paper Einstein submitted for the May 5, 1927, meeting of the Prussian Acad-\nemy in Berlin. The records show that the paper was in print when Einstein requested by telephone\nthat it be withdrawn. The unpublished manuscript is in the Einstein archive.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 445\nEinstein came down to breakfast and expressed his misgivings about the new\nquantum theory, every time [he] had invented some beautiful experiment from\nwhich one saw that [the theory] did not work.\nThus began the great debate between Bohr and Einstein. Between 1925 and 1931, the only objection by Einstein that\nappeared in print in the scientific literature is the one at the 1927 Solvay confer-\nence [E13]. However, there exists a masterful account of the Bohr-Einstein dia-\nlogue during these years, published by Bohr in 1949 [B6]. I have written else-\nwhere about the profound role that the\" discussions with Einstein played in Bohr's\nlife [PI].\nThe record of the Solvay meeting contains only minor reactions to Einstein's\ncomments. Let us consider next the\nsubstance of Einstein's remarks.\nEinstein's opening phrase tells more about him than does many a book: 'Je dois\nm'excuser de n'avoir pas approfondi la mecanique des quanta,' I must apologize\nfor not having penetrated quantum mechanics deeply enough [El3]*.\nQuantum mechanics provides the following answer to Einstein's query. As we shall see, what was and is an\naccepted renunciation to others was an intolerable abdication in Einstein's eyes.\nI have dwelt at some length on this simple problem since it contains the germ\nof Einstein's position, which he stated more explicitly in later years. Meanwhile,\nthe debate in the corridors between Bohr and Einstein continued during the sixth\nSolvay Conference (on magnetism) in 1930. This time Einstein thought he had\nfound a counterexample to the uncertainty principle. During\nthe whole evening he was extremely unhappy, going from one to the other and\ntrying to persuade them that it couldn't be true, that it would be the end of physics\nif Einstein were right; but he couldn't produce any refutation.\nAfter this refutation by Bohr, Einstein ceased his search for inconsistencies. This paper, a forerunner of\nthe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article to be discussed below, need not be remem-\nbered for its conclusions.\nA far more important expression of Einstein's opinions is found in a letter he\nwrote the following September.' Einstein had\nalready proposed Heisenberg and Schroedinger in 1928, and proposed Schroedinger again in 1932\n(see Chapter 31).\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 449\nNot that from then on he desisted from criticizing quantum mechanics.\nDuring the last twenty-five years of life, Einstein maintained that quantum\nmechanics was incomplete.\nIn November 1931 Einstein gave a colloquium in Berlin 'on the uncertainty\nrelation' [El6]. The report of this talk does not state that Einstein objected to\nHeisenberg's relations. My friend Gasimir has written to me about a colloquium Einstein gave\nin Leiden, with Ehrenfest in the chair [Cl] (this must have been in November\n1930). In his talk, Einstein discussed several aspects of the clock-in-the-box exper-\niments. Einstein reacted to this statement as follows: 'Ich weiss es,\nwiderspruchsfrei ist die Sache schon, aber sie enthalt meines Erachtens doch eine\ngewisse Harte' (I know, this business is free of contradictions, yet in my view it\ncontains a certain unreasonableness).\nIt was in 1935 that Einstein stated his own desiderata for the first time in a\nprecise form. By 1935 Einstein was settled in Princeton. At this point, I\ninterrupt the account of the quantum theory in order to describe what happened\nto Einstein and his family from 1932 to 1945. Einstein at Princeton\nEinstein settled permanently in the United States in October 1933.\nEinstein's decision to move to Princeton was the result of three meetings with\nAbraham Flexner [Fl]. On that occasion, he\nwas introduced to Einstein. When they met again in Oxford, in the spring of 1932, Flexner asked if\nEinstein himself might be interested in joining the Institute. At their third meeting,\nin Caputh in June 1932, Einstein said he was enthusiastic about coming, provided\nhe could bring his assistant, Walther Mayer; for himself he requested an annual\nsalary of $3000.\nEinstein originally intended to spend five months of the year in Princeton and\nthe rest of the time in Berlin [K2]. The situation deteriorated rapidly, however, and in a letter dated\nMarch 28, 1933, Einstein sent his resignation to the Akademie in Berlin [K4].\nMarch 28 was also the day on which the Einsteins arrived in Antwerp, return-\ning from California. They had to return to Europe because Einstein had obliga-\ntions and because arrangements had to be made for the move to Princeton, which\nnow, of course, was to be their only home. Rumors were rife of planned attempts on\nEinstein's life. Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser saw\n*On April 21 he also resigned from the Bavarian Academy.\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 451\nto it that Einstein's papers in Berlin were saved and sent to the Quai d'Orsay by\nFrench diplomatic pouch. Einstein\ntraveled.\nIn the midst of these happenings, Einstein and Mayer managed to do a little\nphysics and complete two papers on semivectors, which they sent from Le Goq to\nHolland for publication in the Royal Dutch Academy proceedings [E21, E22].\nThese were sequels to a joint paper they had finished a few days before Einstein\nhad set off for Pasadena [E23]. They went on to relate semi-\n*A report in The New York Times [N2] that Einstein was present at a Zionist Congress in Prague\nin August is incorrect.*\nOn September 9 Einstein left the Continent for good. On October 7 Einstein joined them in Southampton.\nOn October 17 they arrived in New York and were met at quarantine by Edgar\nBamberger and Herbert Maass, trustees of the Institute, who handed Einstein a\nletter from Flexner, the Institute's first director. It was to be Einstein's last home. This was Einstein's last trip outside the United States.\n**One biographer's story [C2] that Mayer had joined Einstein in England is incorrect.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 453\nIn 1938 Einstein's son Hans Albert came to the United States. In 1930\ntheir son Bernhard Caesar was born, Einstein's first grandchild.\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Einstein gave the Queen of Belgium\nhis early impressions of Princeton: 'A quaint ceremonious village of puny demi-\ngods on stilts' [E24]. Even a man with a strong inner life like Einstein had to\nadjust himself to a new environment.\nEinstein went on with his physics.\n454 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nDuring the years 1933-45 Einstein spoke out less on political issues than he\nhad done before or would do again after the war.\nMuch has been written about Einstein's letters to President Roosevelt on the\nimportance of the development of atomic weapons [E26].\nThe story of Einstein in Princeton will be continued and concluded in Chapter\n27. Before returning to objective reality, I mention one anecdote of Einstein's early\nyears in the United States, a story I owe to Helen Dukas.\nDuring a speech by a high official at a major reception for Einstein, the honored\nguest took out his pen and started scribbling equations on the back of his program,\noblivious to everything. Everybody stood\nup, clapping hands and turning to Einstein. 'We find ourselves here on the very path taken by Einstein of adapt-\ning our modes of perception borrowed from the sensations to the gradually deep-\nening knowledge of the laws of Nature' [B5]. 'The hindrances met with on\nthis path originate above all in the fact that, so to say, every word in the language\n*See [N5] for some of Einstein's opinions during the period 1933-45.\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 455\nrefers to our ordinary perception.\nIn contrast to the view that the concept of phenomenon irrevocably includes the\nspecifics of the experimental conditions of observation, Einstein held that one\nshould seek for a deeper-lying theoretical framework which permits the descrip-\ntion of phenomena independently of these conditions.\nIn an article written in 1935 with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen [E27],\nEinstein gave reasons for his position by discussing an example, simple as always. On May 4, 1935, The New York Times carried an article under the\nheading 'Einstein attacks quantum theory,' which also includes an interview with another physicist.\nIts May 7 issue contains a statement by Einstein in which he deprecated this release, which did not\nhave his authorization.\nThe only part of this article that will ultimately survive, I believe, is this last\nphrase, which so poignantly summarizes Einstein's views on quantum mechanics\nin his later years. The content of this paper has been referred to on occasion as\nthe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.\nThis concludes an account of Einstein's position.* I\nhave chosen to confine myself to the exchanges between Einstein and Bohr because\nI believe that Einstein's views come out most clearly in juxtaposing them with\nBohr's. Bohr was in Princeton when he put the\n*In 1950 Einstein mentioned Schroedinger and von Laue as the only ones who shared his views\n[E32].\nNote also that the term hidden variable does not occur in any of Einstein's papers or letters, as far\nas I know.\nEINSTEIN S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 457\nfinishing touches to his 1949 article [B6], and we discussed these matters often at\nthat time. (It was during one of these discussions that Einstein sneaked in to steal\nsome tobacco [PI].\nIt has been stressed many times that, in order to follow Einstein's thinking, it\nis necessary to see him both as a critic and as a visionary.

On\nthe following day Hermann went to register the birth of his son. Ulm, March 15,1879. Today, the merchant Her-\nmann Einstein, residing in Ulm, Bahnhofstrasse 135, of the Israelitic faith, per-\nsonally known, appeared before the undersigned registrar, and stated that a child\nof the male sex, who has received the name Albert, was born in Ulm, in his res-\nidence, to his wife Pauline Einstein, nee Koch, of the Israelitic faith, on March\n14 of the year 1879, at 11:30 a. Read, confirmed, and signed: Hermann Ein-\nstein.\nAlbert was the first of Hermann and Pauline's two children. There may never have been a human\nbeing to whom Einstein felt closer than his sister Maja (as she was always called).\nThe choice of nonancestral names for both children illustrates the assimilationist\ndisposition in the Einstein family, a trend widespread among German Jews in the\nnineteenth century.\nHermann Einstein, an unruffled, kind-hearted, and rather passive man, loved\nby all acquaintances [R3], was fond of literature and in the evenings would read\nSchiller and Heine aloud to his family [R4]. Shortly\nafter Albert's birth, Hermann's enterprising and energetic younger brother Jakob,\nan engineer, proposed that together they start a small gas and water installation\nbusiness in Munich.

Einstein also continued to study mathematics on his own.\nThere is another story of the Munich days that Einstein himself would occa-\nsionally tell with some glee. Einstein\nreplied that he had done nothing wrong.\nThe preceding collection of stories about Einstein the young boy demonstrates\nthe remarkable extent to which his most characteristic personal traits were native\nrather than acquired.

Einstein's fascination with experiment must have been dampened.\nEinstein, in turn, was not impressed with Weber's physics courses.** On several later occasions, he singled out Adolf Hurwitz and Hermann\nMinkowski as excellent mathematics teachers [R9, E6]. These few-month periods were made easy for Einstein\nbecause Marcel Grossmann made available his lecture notes, beautifully written,\nmeticulously organized.\n**For a complete list of Einstein's four-year curriculum, see [S7].\nfit is of interest for Einstein's later work on general relativity that he also attended some of Geiser's\nlectures on differential geometry [Kl, RIO). And so,\nin August 1900, Einstein became qualified as a Fachlehrer, together with three\nother students, who each immediately obtained positions as assistants at the ETH\n[S5].* Einstein himself was jobless.\nEarly in 1901 Einstein again tried to find a university position. I would have found one long ago if Weber had not played\na dishonest game with me' [E14]4 In March 1901 he sent a reprint of his first\npaper to Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig, along with a letter in which he\ninquired 'whether you perhaps might have use for a mathematical physicist who\nis familiar with absolute measurements' [El5]. The\nyear after that Ostwald would be the first to propose Einstein for the Nobel\nprize.\n**After Weber's death in 1912, Einstein wrote to a friend, in a way quite uncommon for him,\n'Weber's death is good for the ETH' [E10].'\n\u00a7The letters from the Einsteins to Ostwald have been reproduced in [K2].\n46 INTRODUCTORY\nFinally Einstein found a temporary job. Here is Einstein writing in Decem-\nber 1901: 'Since September 15, 1901, I am a teacher at a private school in\nSchaffhausen. This work was not\naccepted as a thesis, however, f This setback was the last one in Einstein's career.\nThe first initiative for the move to Bern had already been taken some time in\n1900, when Marcel Grossmann had spoken to his family about Einstein's employ-\nment difficulties. Einstein was deeply grate-\nful for this recommendation4 There the matter rested until December 11, 1901,\nwhen a vacancy at the patent office was advertised in the Schweizerisches Bundes-\nblatt. Einstein at once sent a letter of application [E20]. One of his students described him as follows: 'about five feet ten,\nbroad-shouldered, slightly stooped, a pale brown skin, a sensuous mouth, black\nmoustache, nose slightly aquiline, radiant brown eyes, a pleasant voice, speaking\n*In this same letter, Einstein also reported that he had met one of the leading German physicists.\nfl have been unable to find a response from Zurich concerning Einstein's proposed thesis. Earlier in the year, Einstein had contemplated sub-\nmitting an extended version of his first paper, on intermolecular forces, as a PhD thesis [E14]. Einstein, Solovine, and another friend, Konrad Habicht, met regularly to\ndiscuss philosophy, physics, and literature, from Plato to Dickens.*\nMeanwhile, Einstein's appointment by the Swiss federal council came through. In 1902 there was tem-\nporary friction between Einstein and his mother, who neither then nor later liked\nMileva [E23]. Hermann Einstein died on October 10,\n1902, and was buried in Milan.\nEinstein did well at the patent office. There was always enough time and energy left for his own\nphysics.\nNo one before or since has widened the horizons of physics in so short a time\nas Einstein did in 1905. His work of that year will of course be discussed at length\n*In his late sixties, Einstein remembered the days 'when we ran our happy \"Academy,\" which after\nall was less childish than those respectable ones which I got to know later from close in' [E22]. At the end of 1907 Einstein made\nthe first important strides toward the general theory of relativity (see Chapter 9). Einstein's days in Bern are not\nyet over, but a new phase is about to begin: his academic career (see further Sec-\ntion lOa).\nAt the end of his life, Einstein wrote that the greatest thing Marcel Grossman\ndid for him was to recommend him to the patent office with the help of the elder\nGrossman [E26].\nAn Addendum on Einstein Biographies\nIn preparing this chapter, I have striven to rely as much as possible on original\ndocuments. The Einstein Archives in Princeton and Helen Dukas's guidance\nwere, of course, of prime importance. In addition, I have made grateful use of the following\nbiographies.

A second shortcoming of the book is the absence of the\nbrief Section V of Einstein's 1907 article [E9].\nIn the 1911 paper Einstein cautioned his readers, 'Even if the theoretical foun-\ndation is correct, the relations derived here are valid only in first approximation,'\nbut did not add an explicit statement about the nature of this approximation.\nTurning to the first of the Prague papers, I should evidently begin with the\napproximations to which Einstein referred. Thus in 1911 we discern the first glimpses of the new Einstein\nprogram: to derive the equivalence principle from a new theory of gravitation.

The reader interested in a more complete picture of his actions and\nbeliefs is referred once again to the book Einstein on Peace [Nl], in which the\ndocumentation of this period, covering hundreds of pages, illustrates how much\neffort Einstein devoted in his last years to issues dealing with the world's future.\nTwo further issues, bearing on Einstein's political views but going much\ndeeper, must be mentioned.' It appears to me that Einstein's Jewish identity emerged ever more\nstrongly as he grew older.\nDuring the last years of his life, Einstein was not well. He sug-\ngested an experimental laparotomy, to which Einstein consented. Einstein stayed in the hospital until the incision had sufficiently healed.\nOn March 18, 1950, Einstein put his signature to his last will and testament. Eduard\ndied in Burgholzli in 1965, Hans Albert in Berkeley in 1973. What happened\nnext has been described by a friend who was with Einstein that evening.\nIn March of that year, Einstein had occasion to remember three old friends. In this note, he mentioned 'the need\nto express at least once in my life my gratitude to Marcel Grossmann,' the friend\nwhose notebooks he had used as a student, who had helped him to get a job at the\npatent office, to whom he had dedicated his doctoral thesis, and with whom he\nhad written his first paper on the tensor theory of general relativity.\nOn the morning of Wednesday, April 13, the Israeli consul called on Einstein\nat his home in order to discuss the draft of a statement Einstein intended to make\non television and radio on the occasion of the forthcoming anniversary of Israel's\nindependence.'\nThese may well be the last phrases Einstein committed to paper.\nThat afternoon Einstein collapsed at home. That evening, two med-\nical friends of Einstein's were called to Princeton from New York: Rudolf Ehr-\nmann, who had been his physician in Berlin, and Gustav Bucky, a radiologist. On Saturday Einstein called the\nhouse to ask for his glasses.\nAlberta Rozsel, a night nurse at the hospital, was the last person to see Einstein\nalive. Einstein mumbled in German.

His critical\nattitude to Boltzmann's approach, implied by this statement, will be discussed in\nSection 4d.\nIn concluding this introduction, I note that the period of Einstein's activities\n60 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nconcerning the foundations of statistical mechanics preceded the appearance of the\nfirst papers in which it was noted that all was not well with Boltzmann's ergodic\nhypothesis. Maxwell and Boltzmann*\nBoltzmann's grave, in the Central Cemetery in Vienna, is marked by a monument\non which the formula\nis carved. 'It is immaterial that Boltzmann never wrote down the equation in this\nform. The constant k was also first introduced\nby Planck and not by Boltzmann' [S4]. Klein's studies of the work of Maxwell and Boltzmann have served me\nas an indispensable guide.\nBoltzmann had already begun his attempts to derive the second law when Max-\nwell wrote these lines, but he did not yet understand its statistical character. The\nstated purpose of Boltzmann's first paper on the subject (1866) was 'to give a\ncompletely general proof of the second law of the theory of heat, as well as to\ndiscover the theorem in mechanics that corresponds to it' [B2]. It contains the Boltzmann equation. (In that same period, Boltzmann also\ndid important work on the equipartition theorem and in 1876 gave the derivation\nof the 'law' of Dulong and Petit.)\nAt that time, Boltzmann still did not have it entirely straight, however. This led to a priority argument\nbetween Boltzmann and Clausius\u2014to the amusement of Maxwell [K2].\n$ For the influence of Loschmidt's ideas on Boltzmann, see especially [K3]. Boltzmann immediately recognized the importance of this\nobservation [B5] and in a major paper, published in 1877 [B6], finally arrived at\nthe modern view: in the approach to equilibrium the increase in entropy is not the\nactual but the most probable course of events. Just as Loschmidt's remark guided\nBoltzmann, so, twenty years later, did Boltzmann play a similar role for Planck,\nwho at that time was trying to derive the equilibrium distribution for blackbody\nradiation under the assumption that the increase in entropy is an absolute law. In\nthe course of a polemic between these two men, Boltzmann became the first to\nprove the property of time-reversal in electromagnetic theory: the Maxwell equa-\ntions are invariant under the joint inversion of the directions of time and of the\nmagnetic field, the electric field being left unaltered [B7].* Boltzmann was also the first to state explicitly that\nthis interpretation might need reconsideration in the presence of time-asymmetric\ndynamic forces.**\nI turn next to Boltzmann's definition of the concept of thermodynamic proba-\nbility. This we\nshall call Boltzmann's first definition of probability.\nI alluded earlier to Einstein's critical attitude toward some of Boltzmann's ideas.\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 63\nself in 1903 [Ell], evidently unaware of Boltzmann's paper of 1868.) Rather, Einstein had reservations about the second def-\ninition of probability, which Boltzmann gave in the paper of 1877 [B6]. In that\npaper, Boltzmann introduced for the first time a new tool, the so-called statistical\nmethod, in which there is no need to deal explicitly with collision mechanisms and\ncollision frequencies (as there is in the kinetic method). This assumption,\nBoltzmann stressed, 'gives us the sole possibility of recognizing the same material\npoint at different times' [B13]. As Erwin Schroedinger emphasized, 'Nobody\nbefore Boltzmann held it necessary to define what one means by [the term] the\nsame material point' [S5].\nConsider next (following Boltzmann) the specific case of an ideal gas model in\nwhich the energies of the individual particles can take on only discrete values\ne,,e2). Let there be rc, particles with energy e, so that\n*See Lorentz [L3] for the equivalence of this method with the microcanonical ensemble of Gibbs.\nAlso, the notion of ensemble has its roots in Boltzmann's work [B12], as was stressed by Gibbs in\nthe preface of his book on statistical mechanics [Gl].4 is given by\nBoltzmann took w to be proportional to the probability of the distribution speci-\nfied by (n^,n2, .\nFor later purposes I need to mention a further development, one not due to\nBoltzmann. Thus the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution follows** from the extremal conditions\n\"The names fine-grained and coarse-grained density (feine und grobe Dichte) were introduced by\nthe Ehrenfests [E45].\n**For the classical ideal gas, one can get the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution directly from Eqs.5; that is just what Boltzmann himself did.The entropy in equilibrium, \u00a3\u201e,, is given by (see Eq.3)\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 65\nEinstein's precursors have now been sufficiently introduced.* Boltzmann was well aware of the need to show this\nequivalence.\nSecond, why did Boltzmann himself not introduce the symbol k.** After all,\nhis 1877 paper [B6] contains a section entitled 'The Relation of the Entropy to\nthe Quantity Which I Have Called Partition Probability,' that quantity being\nessentially In W. I hope that this question will be discussed\nsome day by someone more at home with Boltzmann's work than I am. Boltzmann was aware\nof this: '[InH7] also has a meaning for an irreversible bodyf and also steadily\nincreases during [such a process]' [B6]. Preludes to 1905\nBoltzmann's qualities as an outstanding lecturer are not reflected in his scientific\npapers, which are sometimes unduly long, occasionally obscure, and often dense.\nAlso (and especially in regard to the theoretical interpretation of the second law),\nBoltzmann would change his point of view from one paper to the next without\n*For introductions to this problem, see, e.\n**As to what might have been, in 1860 Maxwell could have been the first to introduce k when he\nderived his velocity distribution, in which the Boltzmann factor makes its first appearance.\n66 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nadvance warning to the reader.* Maxwell said of his writings: 'By the study of\nBoltzmann I have been unable to understand him. Einstein once said to a student of his: 'Boltzmann's work is not easy\nto read.\nBy then he must have read Boltzmann's major memoir of 1877 on the statistical\nmechanical derivation of the second law, since he referred to that paper (for the\nfirst time. However, it is very doubtful whether in the years from\n1901 to 1904, when he did his own work on this subject, Einstein knew either this\npaper or the one of 1868, in which Boltzmann had introduced his first definition\nof probability.:):\nYet Einstein was acquainted with some of Maxwell's and Boltzmann's achieve-\nments. As he put it in his first paper on statistical physics [E10]: 'Maxwell's and\nBoltzmann's theories have already come close to the goal' of deriving the laws of\nthermal equilibrium and the second law from the equations of mechanics and the\ntheory of probability. This reference is to Boltzmann's lectures on gas theory [B15],\na two-volume work which contains much original research and which was cer-\ntainly not intended by Boltzmann to be a synopsis of his earlier work. The book\nis largely based on the kinetic method (the Boltzmann equation); by comparison,\nthe comments on the statistical method are quite brief. The counting formula of\ncomplexions is mentioned [B6]; however, said Boltzmann, 'I must content myself\nto indicate [this method] only in passing,' and he then concluded this topic with\na reference to his 1877 paper. Also, it seems possible to me that Einstein knew of\n*See especially Klein's memoir [K3] for a discussion of Boltzmann's style. investigations by Boltzmann seems to be .\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 67\nMaxwell's work on kinetic theory only to the extent that it was discussed by Boltz-\nmann in those same volumes. At this stage, he of course needed\nsome definition for the thermodynamic probability W, and it is here that he inde-\npendently introduced Boltzmann's first definition in terms of the time spent in the\nappropriate interval in F space. He had been studying Boltzmann's book since 1901 [E51]. The book\ndoes refer to the Loschmidt objection, but, in typical Boltzmann fashion, in a\nsomewhat tucked-away place [B16]. Here we have but one\nexample of the fact that, at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\nBoltzmann's ideas had not yet been assimilated by many of those who were active\nat the frontiers of statistical physics. A larger audience acquired some degree of\nfamiliarity with Boltzmann's work only after its exegesis by the Ehrenfests, pub-\nlished in 1911 [E3]. By that time, he had read Boltzmann's work of 1877 (as mentioned earlier),\nin which it was stated that the entropy does not always, but rather almost always,\nincrease. They led him to ask,\nin 1904, What is the meaning of the Boltzmann constant. which was found by\nBoltzmann for ideal gases and assumed by Planck in his theory of radiation.\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 69\nthe context of statistical considerations. Einstein turned to fluctuations for the first time in 1904,\nwhen he considered a system with variable energy E in thermal equilibrium with\na very large second system at temperature T.\nNext, Einstein introduced a criterion for fluctuations to be large:\nThis relation is not satisfied by a classical ideal gas under normal conditions, since\nthen (E) = nkT/2 (n is the number of particles) so that \u00a3 = 0(n~'), indepen-\ndent of the volume.\n70 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nif V is small.\nThe remainder of the present chapter is devoted to a discussion of Einstein's gen-\neral views on statistical physics, in 1905 and in the years following. Einstein and Boltzmann's Principle\nI have already stressed that all of Einstein's main contributions to the quantum\ntheory are statistical in origin. This paper, in which the term Boltzmann's\nprinciple appears in the literature for the first time, contains a critique of Boltz-\nmann's statistical method. More than that, he believed that one could dispense with\nsuch countings altogether: 'In this way, [I] hope to eliminate a logical difficulty\nwhich still hampers the implementation of Boltzmann's principle' [El3]. Boltzmann's principle (Eq.20 can of course also be derived from Boltzmann's formula Eq. The counting of complexions gives\nmore information, however, to wit, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Therefore it is dubious whether the Boltzmann principle has\nany meaning without a complete molecular-mechanical theory or some other the-\nory which describes the elementary processes. His subsequent views on this subject are best illustrated by his\ncomments on Boltzmann and Gibbs in later years. Of Boltzmann he wrote in72 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nFor the case of an ideal gas, the subsystems may be taken to be the individual\nmolecules. To begin\nwith, it needs to be stressed that Boltzmann's principle was as sacred to Einstein\nas the law of conservation of energy [E54]. That is to say, where Boltzmann made an Ansatz about probability in\norder to arrive at an expression for the entropy, Einstein suggested the use of\nphenomenological information about entropy in order to deduce what the proba-\nbility had to be. Once again complain-\ning about the complexions, he observed, 'Neither Herr Boltzmann nor Herr\nPlanck has given a definition of W [E24]. Boltzmann, the classical physicist, was\ngone when these words were written.74 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nwhere the expressions in brackets refer to equilibrium values. He reinvented\nBoltzmann's first definition of probability in terms of 'time spent.' His critical\nposition in regard to Boltzmann's second definition may have led him to replace\nthe 'Boltzmann logic,' W \u2014\u00bb S, by the 'Einstein logic,' S \u2014*\u2022 W.

After 1905, Ein-\nstein would occasionally mention in conversation that 'it is puzzling that Boltz-\nmann did not himself draw this most perspicuous consequence [i., the explana-\ntion of Brownian motion], since Boltzmann had laid the foundations for the whole\nsubject' [SI]. However, it is hard to imagine the embattled Boltzmann evincing\nthe serious yet playful spirit with which Einstein handled the problem of molec-\nular reality.\nEven more profoundly novel are Einstein's applications of statistical ideas to\nquantum physics. They include his work on specific heats, on particle-wave\nduality, on the particle nature of the light-quantum, on spontaneous and induced\nradiative processes, and on a new derivation of the blackbody radiation formula.\nSince Einstein's papers on statistical physics cover so much ground, it may be\nhelpful to preface a more detailed discussion of their main points with a brief\nchronology.

In 1915 he wrote a semipopular review\non kinetic problems [E43]. Sections 4c and 4d deal with the 1902-4 papers and\nwith Einstein's subsequent involvement with Boltzmann's principle. Chapter 5,\nwhich opens with introductory remarks on the highly complex subject of molec-\nular reality in the nineteenth century, is devoted mainly to Einstein's doctoral\nthesis, Brownian motion, and critical opalescence.\nEinstein's position regarding questions of principle in statistical mechanics is\nbest explained by first reviewing briefly the contributions of Maxwell and, espe-\ncially, of Boltzmann. His critical\nattitude to Boltzmann's approach, implied by this statement, will be discussed in\nSection 4d.\nIn concluding this introduction, I note that the period of Einstein's activities\n60 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nconcerning the foundations of statistical mechanics preceded the appearance of the\nfirst papers in which it was noted that all was not well with Boltzmann's ergodic\nhypothesis. Maxwell and Boltzmann*\nBoltzmann's grave, in the Central Cemetery in Vienna, is marked by a monument\non which the formula\nis carved. 'It is immaterial that Boltzmann never wrote down the equation in this\nform. This was first done by Planck. The constant k was also first introduced\nby Planck and not by Boltzmann' [S4]. Indeed, k is a twentieth century symbol\nwhich was used for the first time in the formula\nproposed on December 14, 1900, by Planck [PI] for the thermal equilibrium dis-\ntribution of blackbody radiation. Lorentz referred to k as Planck's constant as late as 1911 [L3].3, the insight that the second law of thermodynamics can\nbe understood only in terms of a connection between entropy and probability, is\none of the great advances of the nineteenth century. Klein's studies of the work of Maxwell and Boltzmann have served me\nas an indispensable guide.\n\"Planck's discovery will be treated in Chapter 19.2 but in which\nh and k do not yet occur explicitly had been proposed by Planck on the preceding October 19 [P2].\nBoltzmann had already begun his attempts to derive the second law when Max-\nwell wrote these lines, but he did not yet understand its statistical character. The\nstated purpose of Boltzmann's first paper on the subject (1866) was 'to give a\ncompletely general proof of the second law of the theory of heat, as well as to\ndiscover the theorem in mechanics that corresponds to it' [B2]. In the first of two\npapers, he dealt with the equilibrium relation between entropy, heat, and tem-\nperature [B4]. It contains the Boltzmann equation. (In that same period, Boltzmann also\ndid important work on the equipartition theorem and in 1876 gave the derivation\nof the 'law' of Dulong and Petit.)\nAt that time, Boltzmann still did not have it entirely straight, however. This led to a priority argument\nbetween Boltzmann and Clausius\u2014to the amusement of Maxwell [K2].\n$ For the influence of Loschmidt's ideas on Boltzmann, see especially [K3]. Boltzmann immediately recognized the importance of this\nobservation [B5] and in a major paper, published in 1877 [B6], finally arrived at\nthe modern view: in the approach to equilibrium the increase in entropy is not the\nactual but the most probable course of events. Just as Loschmidt's remark guided\nBoltzmann, so, twenty years later, did Boltzmann play a similar role for Planck,\nwho at that time was trying to derive the equilibrium distribution for blackbody\nradiation under the assumption that the increase in entropy is an absolute law. In\nthe course of a polemic between these two men, Boltzmann became the first to\nprove the property of time-reversal in electromagnetic theory: the Maxwell equa-\ntions are invariant under the joint inversion of the directions of time and of the\nmagnetic field, the electric field being left unaltered [B7].* Boltzmann was also the first to state explicitly that\nthis interpretation might need reconsideration in the presence of time-asymmetric\ndynamic forces.**\nI turn next to Boltzmann's definition of the concept of thermodynamic proba-\nbility. This we\nshall call Boltzmann's first definition of probability.\nI alluded earlier to Einstein's critical attitude toward some of Boltzmann's ideas.\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 63\nself in 1903 [Ell], evidently unaware of Boltzmann's paper of 1868.) Rather, Einstein had reservations about the second def-\ninition of probability, which Boltzmann gave in the paper of 1877 [B6]. In that\npaper, Boltzmann introduced for the first time a new tool, the so-called statistical\nmethod, in which there is no need to deal explicitly with collision mechanisms and\ncollision frequencies (as there is in the kinetic method). This assumption,\nBoltzmann stressed, 'gives us the sole possibility of recognizing the same material\npoint at different times' [B13]. As Erwin Schroedinger emphasized, 'Nobody\nbefore Boltzmann held it necessary to define what one means by [the term] the\nsame material point' [S5].\nConsider next (following Boltzmann) the specific case of an ideal gas model in\nwhich the energies of the individual particles can take on only discrete values\ne,,e2).\nAlso, the notion of ensemble has its roots in Boltzmann's work [B12], as was stressed by Gibbs in\nthe preface of his book on statistical mechanics [Gl].4 is given by\nBoltzmann took w to be proportional to the probability of the distribution speci-\nfied by (n^,n2, .\nFor later purposes I need to mention a further development, one not due to\nBoltzmann. Thus the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution follows** from the extremal conditions\n\"The names fine-grained and coarse-grained density (feine und grobe Dichte) were introduced by\nthe Ehrenfests [E45].\n**For the classical ideal gas, one can get the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution directly from Eqs.5; that is just what Boltzmann himself did.3)\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 65\nEinstein's precursors have now been sufficiently introduced.* Boltzmann was well aware of the need to show this\nequivalence.\nSecond, why did Boltzmann himself not introduce the symbol k.** After all,\nhis 1877 paper [B6] contains a section entitled 'The Relation of the Entropy to\nthe Quantity Which I Have Called Partition Probability,' that quantity being\nessentially In W. I hope that this question will be discussed\nsome day by someone more at home with Boltzmann's work than I am. Boltzmann was aware\nof this: '[InH7] also has a meaning for an irreversible bodyf and also steadily\nincreases during [such a process]' [B6]. It was also Einstein who, in 1905, in his paper on the\nlight-quantum hypothesis [E13], gave that equation its only fitting name: Boltz-\nmann's principle. Preludes to 1905\nBoltzmann's qualities as an outstanding lecturer are not reflected in his scientific\npapers, which are sometimes unduly long, occasionally obscure, and often dense.\nAlso (and especially in regard to the theoretical interpretation of the second law),\nBoltzmann would change his point of view from one paper to the next without\n*For introductions to this problem, see, e.\n**As to what might have been, in 1860 Maxwell could have been the first to introduce k when he\nderived his velocity distribution, in which the Boltzmann factor makes its first appearance.\n66 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nadvance warning to the reader.* Maxwell said of his writings: 'By the study of\nBoltzmann I have been unable to understand him. Einstein once said to a student of his: 'Boltzmann's work is not easy\nto read.\nBy then he must have read Boltzmann's major memoir of 1877 on the statistical\nmechanical derivation of the second law, since he referred to that paper (for the\nfirst time. However, it is very doubtful whether in the years from\n1901 to 1904, when he did his own work on this subject, Einstein knew either this\npaper or the one of 1868, in which Boltzmann had introduced his first definition\nof probability. Recall\nthat the first of his three papers on the foundations of statistical mechanics was\ncompleted while he was still a teacher at SchafFhausen. It is also\nunclear whether he had read Maxwell's papers on kinetic theory at that time.:):\nYet Einstein was acquainted with some of Maxwell's and Boltzmann's achieve-\nments. As he put it in his first paper on statistical physics [E10]: 'Maxwell's and\nBoltzmann's theories have already come close to the goal' of deriving the laws of\nthermal equilibrium and the second law from the equations of mechanics and the\ntheory of probability. This reference is to Boltzmann's lectures on gas theory [B15],\na two-volume work which contains much original research and which was cer-\ntainly not intended by Boltzmann to be a synopsis of his earlier work. The book\nis largely based on the kinetic method (the Boltzmann equation); by comparison,\nthe comments on the statistical method are quite brief. The counting formula of\ncomplexions is mentioned [B6]; however, said Boltzmann, 'I must content myself\nto indicate [this method] only in passing,' and he then concluded this topic with\na reference to his 1877 paper. Also, it seems possible to me that Einstein knew of\n*See especially Klein's memoir [K3] for a discussion of Boltzmann's style. investigations by Boltzmann seems to be .\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 67\nMaxwell's work on kinetic theory only to the extent that it was discussed by Boltz-\nmann in those same volumes. Thus Einstein did not know the true gaps in the\narguments of Maxwell and, especially, of Boltzmann; nor did he accidentally fill\nthem. The paper is competent and\nneither very interesting nor, by Einstein's own admission [E2], very well written. At this stage, he of course needed\nsome definition for the thermodynamic probability W, and it is here that he inde-\npendently introduced Boltzmann's first definition in terms of the time spent in the\nappropriate interval in F space. He had been studying Boltzmann's book since 1901 [E51]. The book\ndoes refer to the Loschmidt objection, but, in typical Boltzmann fashion, in a\nsomewhat tucked-away place [B16]. Here we have but one\nexample of the fact that, at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\nBoltzmann's ideas had not yet been assimilated by many of those who were active\nat the frontiers of statistical physics. A larger audience acquired some degree of\nfamiliarity with Boltzmann's work only after its exegesis by the Ehrenfests, pub-\nlished in 1911 [E3].\nEinstein's reply to Hertz, also written in 1910 [E2] is remarkable as well.' The latter\nis contained in the only paper Einstein completed in 1904 [El2].* It is indeed a\n*For other discussions of Einstein's 1902-4 papers, see [K4] and [K5]. However, the exchange between\nEinstein and Hertz took place in 1910, when Einstein was a professor at Zurich\n(and taught the kinetic theory of heat during the summer semester of that year\n[S8]). By that time, he had read Boltzmann's work of 1877 (as mentioned earlier),\nin which it was stated that the entropy does not always, but rather almost always,\nincrease.\nNothing indicates Einstein's flowering in 1905, which begins with his very next\npaper. However, there is one aspect (not yet mentioned) of his brief\n1904 paper which does give the first intimations of things to come. They led him to ask,\nin 1904, What is the meaning of the Boltzmann constant.\nIn the opening paragraphs of Einstein's paper of 1904 [E12], reference is made\nto Eq. which was found by\nBoltzmann for ideal gases and assumed by Planck in his theory of radiation. Einstein turned to fluctuations for the first time in 1904,\nwhen he considered a system with variable energy E in thermal equilibrium with\na very large second system at temperature T.\nNext, Einstein introduced a criterion for fluctuations to be large:\nThis relation is not satisfied by a classical ideal gas under normal conditions, since\nthen (E) = nkT/2 (n is the number of particles) so that \u00a3 = 0(n~'), indepen-\ndent of the volume. Second, the reasoning was most important for Einstein's work in 1905,\nsince it drew his attention to the volume dependence of thermodynamic quantities,\na dependence which played a crucial role in his formulation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis, which appeared in his very next paper.\nNevertheless, in 1904 Einstein had already taken a bold new step (of which he\nwas aware): he had applied statistical reasonings to radiation.\nIn May 1905, Einstein was again busy with fluctuations, though in a different\nstyle, when he did his work on Brownian motion, to be discussed in Chapter 5.\nThe remainder of the present chapter is devoted to a discussion of Einstein's gen-\neral views on statistical physics, in 1905 and in the years following. Einstein and Boltzmann's Principle\nI have already stressed that all of Einstein's main contributions to the quantum\ntheory are statistical in origin. Correspondingly, most of his more important com-\nments on the principles of statistical mechanics are found in his papers on quan-\ntum physics. His light-quantum paper of 1905 [E13] is a prime example. This paper, in which the term Boltzmann's\nprinciple appears in the literature for the first time, contains a critique of Boltz-\nmann's statistical method. Since Einstein had\nby then already reinvented Boltzmann's first definition, it appears safe to assume\nthat he was referring to the counting of complexions. More than that, he believed that one could dispense with\nsuch countings altogether: 'In this way, [I] hope to eliminate a logical difficulty\nwhich still hampers the implementation of Boltzmann's principle' [El3]. In order\nto illustrate what he had in mind, he gave a new derivation of a well-known for-\nmula for the change of entropy S of an ideal gas when, at constant temperature\nT, the volume changes reversibly from F0 to V:\nwhere n is the number of molecules in the gas, R is the gas constant, and TV is\nAvogadro's number.*) Einstein derived Eq. Boltzmann's principle (Eq.20 can of course also be derived from Boltzmann's formula Eq. The counting of complexions gives\nmore information, however, to wit, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Therefore it is dubious whether the Boltzmann principle has\nany meaning without a complete molecular-mechanical theory or some other the-\nory which describes the elementary processes. However, as a matter of principle the case of\na real gas can be dealt with by using Gibbs's coarse-grained microcanonical\nensemble, a procedure with which Einstein apparently was not yet familiar.\nAfter 1910, critical remarks on the statistical method are no longer found in\nEinstein's papers. His subsequent views on this subject are best illustrated by his\ncomments on Boltzmann and Gibbs in later years. Of Boltzmann he wrote in72 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nFor the case of an ideal gas, the subsystems may be taken to be the individual\nmolecules. To begin\nwith, it needs to be stressed that Boltzmann's principle was as sacred to Einstein\nas the law of conservation of energy [E54]. That is to say, where Boltzmann made an Ansatz about probability in\norder to arrive at an expression for the entropy, Einstein suggested the use of\nphenomenological information about entropy in order to deduce what the proba-\nbility had to be. Once again complain-\ning about the complexions, he observed, 'Neither Herr Boltzmann nor Herr\nPlanck has given a definition of W [E24]. Boltzmann, the classical physicist, was\ngone when these words were written.* Neither Einstein, deeply respectful and\nat the same time critical of both men, nor anyone else in 1909 could have foreseen\nhow odd it would appear, late in the twentieth century, to see the efforts of Boltz-\nmann and Planck lumped together in one phrase.\nIn summary, Einstein's work on statistical mechanics prior to 1905 is memo-\nrable first because of his derivation of the energy fluctuation formula and second\nbecause of his interest in the volume dependence of thermodynamic quantities,\n* Planck's counting is discussed in Section 19a.

His critical\nposition in regard to Boltzmann's second definition may have led him to replace\nthe 'Boltzmann logic,' W \u2014\u00bb S, by the 'Einstein logic,' S \u2014*\u2022 W.

Maxwell and Boltzmann*\nBoltzmann's grave, in the Central Cemetery in Vienna, is marked by a monument\non which the formula\nis carved. 'It is immaterial that Boltzmann never wrote down the equation in this\nform. The constant k was also first introduced\nby Planck and not by Boltzmann' [S4]. Klein's studies of the work of Maxwell and Boltzmann have served me\nas an indispensable guide.\n\"Planck's discovery will be treated in Chapter 19.2 but in which\nh and k do not yet occur explicitly had been proposed by Planck on the preceding October 19 [P2].\nBoltzmann had already begun his attempts to derive the second law when Max-\nwell wrote these lines, but he did not yet understand its statistical character. The\nstated purpose of Boltzmann's first paper on the subject (1866) was 'to give a\ncompletely general proof of the second law of the theory of heat, as well as to\ndiscover the theorem in mechanics that corresponds to it' [B2].f He made a fresh\nstart when he returned to the problem in 1871-2: 'The problems of the mechan-\nical theory of heat are . In the first of two\npapers, he dealt with the equilibrium relation between entropy, heat, and tem-\nperature [B4]. It contains the Boltzmann equation. (In that same period, Boltzmann also\ndid important work on the equipartition theorem and in 1876 gave the derivation\nof the 'law' of Dulong and Petit.)\nAt that time, Boltzmann still did not have it entirely straight, however. This led to a priority argument\nbetween Boltzmann and Clausius\u2014to the amusement of Maxwell [K2].\n$ For the influence of Loschmidt's ideas on Boltzmann, see especially [K3]. Boltzmann immediately recognized the importance of this\nobservation [B5] and in a major paper, published in 1877 [B6], finally arrived at\nthe modern view: in the approach to equilibrium the increase in entropy is not the\nactual but the most probable course of events. Just as Loschmidt's remark guided\nBoltzmann, so, twenty years later, did Boltzmann play a similar role for Planck,\nwho at that time was trying to derive the equilibrium distribution for blackbody\nradiation under the assumption that the increase in entropy is an absolute law.* Boltzmann was also the first to state explicitly that\nthis interpretation might need reconsideration in the presence of time-asymmetric\ndynamic forces.**\nI turn next to Boltzmann's definition of the concept of thermodynamic proba-\nbility.

This assumption,\nBoltzmann stressed, 'gives us the sole possibility of recognizing the same material\npoint at different times' [B13]. As Erwin Schroedinger emphasized, 'Nobody\nbefore Boltzmann held it necessary to define what one means by [the term] the\nsame material point' [S5].\nAlso, the notion of ensemble has its roots in Boltzmann's work [B12], as was stressed by Gibbs in\nthe preface of his book on statistical mechanics [Gl].4 is given by\nBoltzmann took w to be proportional to the probability of the distribution speci-\nfied by (n^,n2, .\nFor later purposes I need to mention a further development, one not due to\nBoltzmann.

It was also Einstein who, in 1905, in his paper on the\nlight-quantum hypothesis [E13], gave that equation its only fitting name: Boltz-\nmann's principle. Preludes to 1905\nBoltzmann's qualities as an outstanding lecturer are not reflected in his scientific\npapers, which are sometimes unduly long, occasionally obscure, and often dense.\nAlso (and especially in regard to the theoretical interpretation of the second law),\nBoltzmann would change his point of view from one paper to the next without\n*For introductions to this problem, see, e.\n**As to what might have been, in 1860 Maxwell could have been the first to introduce k when he\nderived his velocity distribution, in which the Boltzmann factor makes its first appearance.* Maxwell said of his writings: 'By the study of\nBoltzmann I have been unable to understand him.

Correspondingly, most of his more important com-\nments on the principles of statistical mechanics are found in his papers on quan-\ntum physics. His light-quantum paper of 1905 [E13] is a prime example. This paper, in which the term Boltzmann's\nprinciple appears in the literature for the first time, contains a critique of Boltz-\nmann's statistical method.

In 1911 Einstein summarized the status of the specific heat problem\nbefore the first Solvay conference [E42].\nThis concludes the introductory summary of Einstein's work on statistical phys-\nics and related subjects. Sections 4c and 4d deal with the 1902-4 papers and\nwith Einstein's subsequent involvement with Boltzmann's principle. Chapter 5,\nwhich opens with introductory remarks on the highly complex subject of molec-\nular reality in the nineteenth century, is devoted mainly to Einstein's doctoral\nthesis, Brownian motion, and critical opalescence.\nAt the beginning of this section, I remarked that Einstein devoted some but not\nmuch attention to his contributions to statistical physics when, at age seventy, he\nlooked back on his work. Einstein did not disagree. One of the aims of this chapter is to explain what Einstein had in\nmind with his phenomenological approach.\nIn concluding this introduction, I note that the period of Einstein's activities\n60 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nconcerning the foundations of statistical mechanics preceded the appearance of the\nfirst papers in which it was noted that all was not well with Boltzmann's ergodic\nhypothesis.\nI alluded earlier to Einstein's critical attitude toward some of Boltzmann's ideas.) Rather, Einstein had reservations about the second def-\ninition of probability, which Boltzmann gave in the paper of 1877 [B6].3)\nENTROPY AND PROBABILITY 65\nEinstein's precursors have now been sufficiently introduced.3 in its\nbroader sense was Einstein. It was also Einstein who, in 1905, in his paper on the\nlight-quantum hypothesis [E13], gave that equation its only fitting name: Boltz-\nmann's principle. Preludes to 1905\nBoltzmann's qualities as an outstanding lecturer are not reflected in his scientific\npapers, which are sometimes unduly long, occasionally obscure, and often dense. Einstein once said to a student of his: 'Boltzmann's work is not easy\nto read. However, it is very doubtful whether in the years from\n1901 to 1904, when he did his own work on this subject, Einstein knew either this\npaper or the one of 1868, in which Boltzmann had introduced his first definition\nof probability.\nIt must have been difficult for Einstein to get hold of scientific journals. It is also\nunclear whether he had read Maxwell's papers on kinetic theory at that time.:):\nYet Einstein was acquainted with some of Maxwell's and Boltzmann's achieve-\nments. From the\nsingle reference in Einstein's paper, it is clear how much he could have learned\nabout their work. Also, it seems possible to me that Einstein knew of\n*See especially Klein's memoir [K3] for a discussion of Boltzmann's style. The reading of Einstein's paper [E10] is not facilitated by the absence of\nan explicit statement as to what, in his opinion, the gaps actually were. The paper is competent and\nneither very interesting nor, by Einstein's own admission [E2], very well written.\nEinstein believed that in his next paper, completed in 1903 [Ell], he gave a\nproof of the second law for irreversible processes. Three\ndays after he sent this paper to the Annalen der Physik, he wrote to Besso, 'Now\n[this work] is completely clear and simple so that I am completely satisfied with\nit' [E50].\nIt was not until 1910 that, for the first time, Einstein's 'derivation' was criticized\nin the literature.\nEinstein's reply to Hertz, also written in 1910 [E2] is remarkable as well.' The latter\nis contained in the only paper Einstein completed in 1904 [El2].* It is indeed a\n*For other discussions of Einstein's 1902-4 papers, see [K4] and [K5].\nIt is interesting but not all that surprising that in 1903 and 1904 Einstein, in\nhis isolation, had missed the point about time reversal. However, the exchange between\nEinstein and Hertz took place in 1910, when Einstein was a professor at Zurich\n(and taught the kinetic theory of heat during the summer semester of that year\n[S8]).\nAs a postscript to the issue of the second law, it is fitting to recall the first\npersonal exchange between Einstein and Ehrenfest, which took place in Prague\nin February 1912. The Einsteins had come to the train to meet the Ehrenfests.\nWhat was the harvest of Einstein's scientific efforts up to this point.\nNothing indicates Einstein's flowering in 1905, which begins with his very next\npaper. However, there is one aspect (not yet mentioned) of his brief\n1904 paper which does give the first intimations of things to come. In the years\n1902 to 1904, Einstein may not have grasped the awesome problems\u2014still a sub-\nject of active research\u2014which have to be coped with in giving the second law a\nfoundation which stands the tests of requisite mathematical rigor.\nIn the opening paragraphs of Einstein's paper of 1904 [E12], reference is made\nto Eq. Einstein turned to fluctuations for the first time in 1904,\nwhen he considered a system with variable energy E in thermal equilibrium with\na very large second system at temperature T. In 1904 Einstein deduced a\nformula for the mean square energy fluctuation\nof the first system.,\n'Einstein used a symbol other than k. Second, the reasoning was most important for Einstein's work in 1905,\nsince it drew his attention to the volume dependence of thermodynamic quantities,\na dependence which played a crucial role in his formulation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis, which appeared in his very next paper.\nNevertheless, in 1904 Einstein had already taken a bold new step (of which he\nwas aware): he had applied statistical reasonings to radiation.\nIn May 1905, Einstein was again busy with fluctuations, though in a different\nstyle, when he did his work on Brownian motion, to be discussed in Chapter 5.\nThe remainder of the present chapter is devoted to a discussion of Einstein's gen-\neral views on statistical physics, in 1905 and in the years following. His light-quantum paper of 1905 [E13] is a prime example.\nDuring the years 1905 to 1920, Einstein stated_more than once his displeasure\nwith the handling of probability by others.\n**Rayleigh had done so before him (see Section 19b), but I do not believe that Einstein knew that\nin 1904.*) Einstein derived Eq.3), which he wrote in the form\n(it took until 1909 before Einstein would write k instead of R/N) implies that a\nreversible change from a state 'a' to a state 'b' satisfies\nLet the system consist of subsystems 1,2,. Einstein was therefore quite right in saying that Eq.\nAfter 1910, critical remarks on the statistical method are no longer found in\nEinstein's papers. To begin\nwith, it needs to be stressed that Boltzmann's principle was as sacred to Einstein\nas the law of conservation of energy [E54]. The difficulties encountered in separating the two questions are seen\nnowhere better than in a comment Einstein made in 1909.* Neither Einstein, deeply respectful and\nat the same time critical of both men, nor anyone else in 1909 could have foreseen\nhow odd it would appear, late in the twentieth century, to see the efforts of Boltz-\nmann and Planck lumped together in one phrase.' His critical\nposition in regard to Boltzmann's second definition may have led him to replace\nthe 'Boltzmann logic,' W \u2014\u00bb S, by the 'Einstein logic,' S \u2014*\u2022 W.

In 1844 he wrote, 'The atomic doctrine .\nTHE REALITY OF MOLECULES 83\none of them its life' [P3]. the atom must remain a tool .\n84 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nthe ten thousand millionth of an inch' [Yl].\nIn order to complete this survey of topics bearing on molecular reality prior to\nthe time Einstein got involved, it is necessary to add two further remarks. Until the very last years of the nineteenth cen-\ntury, most if not all physicists who believed in the reality of atoms shared Max-\nwell's view that these particles remain unbroken and unworn. the\nonly material things which still remain in the precise condition in which they first\nbegan to exist,' he wrote in his book Theory of Heat [M7], which contains the\nfinest expression of his atomic credo.* It is true that many of these same physicists\n(Maxwell among them) were convinced that something had to rattle inside the\natom in order to explain atomic spectra. However, in 1899, two years after his discovery of\nthe electron, Joseph John Thomson announced that the atom had been split:\n'Electrification [that is, ionization] essentially involves the splitting of the atom, a\npart of the mass of the atom getting free and becoming detached from the original\natom' [T3]. By that time it was becoming increasingly clear that radioactive phe-\nnomena (first discovered in 1896) also had to be explained in terms of a divisible\natom. 'Atoms [of radioactive elements], indivisible from the chemical point of view,\nare here divisible,' Marie Curie wrote in 1900 [C3]. She added that the expla-\nnation of radioactivity in terms of the expulsion of subatomic particles 'seriously\nundermines the principles of chemistry.' In 1902 Ernest Rutherford and Frederick\nSoddy proposed their transformation theory, according to which radioactive bodies\ncontain unstable atoms, a fixed fraction of which decay per unit time. Forty years\nlater, a witness to this event characterized the mood of those early times: 'It must\nbe difficult if not impossible for the young physicist or chemist to realize how\n*To Maxwell, electrolytic dissociation was not at variance with the indivisibility of atoms\u2014but that\nis another story.\n86 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nextremely bold [the transformation theory] was and how unacceptable to the\natomists of the time' [R3].\nThus, at the turn of the century, the classical atomists, those who believed both\nin atoms and in their indivisibility, were under fire from two sides. Thomson, the Curies, and Rutherford, all convinced of the\nreality of atoms and all\u2014though not always without trepidation, as in the case of\nMarie Curie\u2014aware of the fact that chemistry was not the last chapter in particle\nphysics. For them, the ancient speculations about atoms had become reality and\nthe old dream of transmutation had become inevitable. If there was one issue on which there was agree-\nment between physicists and chemists, atomists or not, it was that atoms, if they\nexist at all, are too small to be seen.\n88 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\n2.\nThe presentation speech delivered on that occasion illustrates vividly that, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, molecular reality had become widely accepted\namong chemists as well as physicists: 'He proved that gas pressure and osmotic\npressure are identical, and thereby that the molecules themselves in the gaseous\nphase and in solutions are also identical.

Until the very last years of the nineteenth cen-\ntury, most if not all physicists who believed in the reality of atoms shared Max-\nwell's view that these particles remain unbroken and unworn. the\nonly material things which still remain in the precise condition in which they first\nbegan to exist,' he wrote in his book Theory of Heat [M7], which contains the\nfinest expression of his atomic credo.* It is true that many of these same physicists\n(Maxwell among them) were convinced that something had to rattle inside the\natom in order to explain atomic spectra. Therefore, while there was a need for a\npicture of the atom as a body with structure, this did not mean (so it seemed) that\none could take the atom apart. However, in 1899, two years after his discovery of\nthe electron, Joseph John Thomson announced that the atom had been split:\n'Electrification [that is, ionization] essentially involves the splitting of the atom, a\npart of the mass of the atom getting free and becoming detached from the original\natom' [T3]. 'Atoms [of radioactive elements], indivisible from the chemical point of view,\nare here divisible,' Marie Curie wrote in 1900 [C3].' In 1902 Ernest Rutherford and Frederick\nSoddy proposed their transformation theory, according to which radioactive bodies\ncontain unstable atoms, a fixed fraction of which decay per unit time. Forty years\nlater, a witness to this event characterized the mood of those early times: 'It must\nbe difficult if not impossible for the young physicist or chemist to realize how\n*To Maxwell, electrolytic dissociation was not at variance with the indivisibility of atoms\u2014but that\nis another story.\n86 STATISTICAL PHYSICS\nextremely bold [the transformation theory] was and how unacceptable to the\natomists of the time' [R3].\nThus, at the turn of the century, the classical atomists, those who believed both\nin atoms and in their indivisibility, were under fire from two sides. Thomson, the Curies, and Rutherford, all convinced of the\nreality of atoms and all\u2014though not always without trepidation, as in the case of\nMarie Curie\u2014aware of the fact that chemistry was not the last chapter in particle\nphysics. If there was one issue on which there was agree-\nment between physicists and chemists, atomists or not, it was that atoms, if they\nexist at all, are too small to be seen.\nDirect images of atoms were at last produced in the 1950s with the field ion\nmicroscope [M8].

This event marks\nthe birth of modern chemistry, according to which all modes of matter are\nreducible to a finite number of atomic species (eighteen elements were known at\nthat time).\nFifty years later, at the first international scientific conference ever held, the 1860\nKarlsruhe congress of chemists,* the steering committee still considered it neces-\nsary to put at the top of the agenda of points to be discussed the question, 'Shall\na difference be made between the expressions molecule and atom, such that a\nmolecule be named the smallest particle of bodies which can enter into chemical\nreactions and which may be compared to each other in regard to physical prop-\nerties\u2014atoms being the smallest particles of those bodies which are contained in\nmolecules.\nEspecially illuminating for an understanding of science in the nineteenth cen-\ntury are the topics discussed by young August Kekule von Stradonitz (who by\nthen had already discovered that carbon atoms are tetravalent) in the course of his\nopening address to the Karlsruhe conference.

Both physics and chemistry could\nhave profited if more attention had been paid to the comment by Stanislao Can-\nnizzaro, in the discussion following Kekule's paper, that the distinction between\nphysical and chemical molecules has no experimental basis and is therefore unnec-\nessary. Indeed, perhaps the most remarkable fact about the nineteenth century\ndebates on atoms and molecules is the large extent to which chemists and physicists\nspoke at cross purposes when they did not actually ignore each other. This is not\nto say that there existed one common view among chemists, another among phys-\nicists. The principal\npoint of debate among chemists was whether atoms were real objects or only mne-\nmonic devices for coding chemical regularities and laws.\nAn early illustration of the dichotomies between the chemists and the physicists\nis provided by Dalton's opinion about the work of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. There were 127 chemists in attendance.** That conference did not at once succeed in bringing chemists closer\ntogether.

As regards the\nposition of Ernst Mach, it was anti-atomistic but of a far more sober variety than\nOstwald's: 'It would not become physical science [said Mach] to see in its self-\ncreated, changeable, economical tools, molecules and atoms, realities behind phe-\nnomena . However, it became increasingly difficult in chemical circles to deny the\nreality of molecules after 1874, the year in which Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff\nand Joseph Achille Le Bel independently explained the isomerism of certain\norganic substances in terms of stereochemical properties of carbon compounds. 'Atoms [of radioactive elements], indivisible from the chemical point of view,\nare here divisible,' Marie Curie wrote in 1900 [C3]. She added that the expla-\nnation of radioactivity in terms of the expulsion of subatomic particles 'seriously\nundermines the principles of chemistry.

In 1887 or 1888, the two men\ncorresponded\u2014about the Michelson-Morley experiment [V3]. (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether. already then [in 1887]\nsome results were found which later were obtained from the electromagnetic the-\nory' [V4]. Michelson and Morley's wonderfully\ndelicate experiment attempting to decide the important question as to how far\nthe ether is carried along by the earth. In a review of this book, FitzGerald wrote that in the\nanalysis of the Michelson-Morley experiment 'he [Larmor] has to assume that\nthe length of a body depends on whether it is moving lengthwise or sideways\nthrough the ether' [Lll], without referring, however, to his own suggestion made\nmore than ten years earlier. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3]. The main purpose of Lorentz's paper was to examine how well Fresnel's\nstationary aether fitted the facts. He therefore reexamined the aberration and\nFizeau effects and noted in particular another achievement (not yet mentioned) of\nMichelson and Morley: their repetition of the Fizeau experiment with much\ngreater accuracy, which bore out Fresnel's prediction for the drag coefficient in a\nmuch more quantitative way than was known before [M17]. The Michelson-Morley experiment has\nmeanwhile been performed, and Lorentz is now deeply concerned (as was noted\nbefore): 'This experiment has been puzzling me for a long time, and in the end I\nhave been able to think of only one means of reconciling it with Fresnel's theory. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned.' Note that it is, of\ncourse, not necessary for the interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment\nto know what e is.\n1904. In these works, the aether questions are central. He knew of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment which, however, was not as crucial to his formu-\nlation of special relativity as were the first-order effects, the aberration of light,\nand the Fresnel drag [S6, Ol]. He knew the 1895 paper of Lorentz in which the\nMichelson-Morley experiment is discussed at length. Lorentz, November 10, 1894. Morley, Am. Morley and D. Morley, Am.", "Morley_Experiments_1905": " The Michelson-Morley Experiment\nMaxwell's article Ether, written for the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britan-\nnica [Ml], begins with an enumeration of the 'high metaphysical . To mention but three, it shows us that, like his contemporaries, Maxwell\nwas deeply convinced of the reality of some sort of aether: 'There can be no doubt\nthat the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty but are occupied by\na material substance or body, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most\nuniform, body of which we have any knowledge'; it tells us of an unsuccessful\nattempt by Maxwell himself to perform a terrestrial optical experiment aimed at\ndetecting the influence of an aether drag on the earth's motion; and it informs us\nof his opinion that effects of the second order in v/c (v = velocity of the earth\nrelative to the aether, c = velocity of light) are too small to be detectable.\n*For a review of aether theories and aether models, see especially [LI] and [SI]. On March\n19, 1879, Maxwell sent a letter of thanks in which he referred Todd to his ency-\nclopedia article and in particular reiterated his remark on the second-order nature\nof terrestrial experiments. Being already an acknowledged expert on measurements\nof the velocity of light (he had by then published three papers on the subject [L2]),\nhe had concluded that Maxwell had underrated the accuracy with which terres-\ntrial experiments could be performed. The method\nhe used was to compare the times it takes for light to travel the same distance\neither parallel or transversely to the earth's motion relative to the aether. In his\narrangement a stationary aether would yield a time difference corresponding to\nabout an extra 1 /25 of a wavelength of yellow light traveling in the parallel direc-\ntion, an effect that can be detected by letting the transverse and parallel beams\ninterfere.

'The result of the hypothesis of a stationary aether is thus shown to be\nincorrect, and the necessary conclusion follows that the hypothesis is erroneous,'\n[M3]. So did Lorentz, who found\nan error in Michelson's theory of the experiment [L3] and who was dubious about\nthe interpretation of the results [ L4].

The paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment came out the\nfollowing November [M6].\nHowever, more important, the experimental result was accepted. In 1892 Lorentz queried Rayleigh: 'Can there be some\npoint in the theory of Mr Michelson's experiment which had as yet been over-\nlooked. In a lecture before the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, Kelvin\nreferred to the experiment as 'carried out with most searching care to secure a\ntrustworthy result' and characterized its outcome as a nineteenth century cloud\nover the dynamic theory of light [Kl].

You uncovered\nan insidious defect in the ether theory of light, as it then existed, and stimulated\nthe ideas of H. In Pasadena, Einstein had asked Michelson why he had\nspent so much effort on high-precision measurements of the light velocity. Ein-\nstein's main remark about the Michelson-Morley experiment was, 'Its negative\noutcome has much increased the faith in the validity of the general theory of rel-\nativity.\nNevertheless, the answers to both questions\u2014did Einstein know of Michelson's\nwork before 1905.

By Einstein's own account, he knew\nthis 1895 memoir in which Lorentz discussed, among other things, both the aber-\nration of light and the Fizeau experiment.\nFresnel derived this result from the assumption that light imparts elastic vibrations\nto the aether it traverses.* Throughout this paper\nof 1895, the Fresnel aether is postulated explicitly. Note, however,\nthat it was easy to take the Michelson-Morley experiments for granted (as Ein-\nstein repeatedly said he did) once a new look at the first-order effects had led to\nthe new logic of the special theory of relativity. Note also that this experiment was\ndiscussed at length in Lorentz's paper of 1895 and that Einstein was familiar with\nthis paper before 1905.Il8 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nThe concept of an aether at absolute rest, introduced in 1818 by Fresnel in his\ncelebrated letter to Dominique Francois Jean Arago [Fl], served the express pur-\npose of explaining this aberration effect (which would be zero if the aether moved\nalong with the earth). As to the Fizeau effect, Fresnel had predicted that if a liquid\nis moving through a tube with a velocity v relative to the aether and if a light\nbeam traverses the tube in the same direction, then the net light velocity c' in the\nlaboratory is given by\n'SUBTLE is THE LORD' 119\nto take account of the motion of the earth relative to the aether, if we recognized\nthe experimental result as a fact.\nIn his first paper on relativity, Einstein mentions 'the failed attempts to detect\na motion of the earth relative to the \"light-medium\" ' without specifying what\nattempts he had in mind. Einstein's discontent with earlier explanations of first-order effects\nmay have made the mystery of Michelson and Morley's second-order null effect\nless central to him. However, there still were many nineteenth century candidates for this\none aether, some but not all predating Maxwell's theory. There were the aethers\nof Fresnel, Gauchy, Stokes, Neumann, MacCulIagh, Kelvin, Planck, and proba-\nbly others, distinguished by such properties as degree of homogeneity and com-\n*In a thoughtful article on Einstein and the Michelson-Morley experiment, Holton [H2] raised the\npossibility that Einstein might have had in mind other null effects known by then, such as the absence\nof double refraction [B2, Rl] and the Trouton-Noble experiment [Tl].\n**See the second volume of Hertz's collected works [H3], which is also available in English trans-\nlation [H4],\n120 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\npressibility, and the extent to which the earth dragged the aether along.'\nThe most important question for all these authors of aethers and makers of\nMaxwell theories was to find a dynamic understanding of the aberration of light,\nof Fresnel drag, and, later, of the Michelson-Morley experiment. It follows\u2014as we shall\nsee\u2014that in 1905 Einstein did not know of Lorentz transformations. In 1887 or 1888, the two men\ncorresponded\u2014about the Michelson-Morley experiment [V3]. (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether. already then [in 1887]\nsome results were found which later were obtained from the electromagnetic the-\nory' [V4]. Michelson and Morley's wonderfully\ndelicate experiment attempting to decide the important question as to how far\nthe ether is carried along by the earth. Their result seems opposed to other\nexperiments showing that the ether in the air can be carried along only to an\ninappreciable extent. I would suggest that almost the only hypothesis that can\nreconcile this opposition is that the length of material bodies changes, according\nas they are moving through the ether or across it, by an amount depending on\nthe square of the ratio of their velocities to that of light. In a review of this book, FitzGerald wrote that in the\nanalysis of the Michelson-Morley experiment 'he [Larmor] has to assume that\nthe length of a body depends on whether it is moving lengthwise or sideways\nthrough the ether' [Lll], without referring, however, to his own suggestion made\nmore than ten years earlier. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3]. The main purpose of Lorentz's paper was to examine how well Fresnel's\nstationary aether fitted the facts. He therefore reexamined the aberration and\nFizeau effects and noted in particular another achievement (not yet mentioned) of\nMichelson and Morley: their repetition of the Fizeau experiment with much\ngreater accuracy, which bore out Fresnel's prediction for the drag coefficient in a\nmuch more quantitative way than was known before [M17]. Since at that time\nLorentz had a right to be dubious about the precision of the Potsdam experiment,\nhe concluded that there was no particular source for worry: 'It seems doubtful in\nmy opinion that the hypothesis of Fresnel has been refuted by experiment' [L3].\nWe move to 1892, the year in which Lorentz publishes his first paper on his\natomistic electromagnetic theory [L12]. The Michelson-Morley experiment has\nmeanwhile been performed, and Lorentz is now deeply concerned (as was noted\nbefore): 'This experiment has been puzzling me for a long time, and in the end I\nhave been able to think of only one means of reconciling it with Fresnel's theory. In order to interpret this result, Lorentz assumed that molecular forces, like\nelectromagnetic forces, 'act by means of an intervention of the aether' and that a\ncontraction effect O(v2/c2) cannot be excluded on any known experimental\ngrounds.10) only as a convenient mathematical tool for proving a physical theorem, in\nhis case that to O(v/c) terrestrial optical experiments are independent of the\nmotion of the earth, a result already mentioned in Section 6a. At this stage, Lorentz's explanation for the\nabsence of any evidence for a stationary aether was hybrid in character: to first\norder he had derived the null effects from electrodynamics; to second order he had\nto introduce his ad hoc hypothesis expressed by Eq.\nAs has been noted repeatedly, in 1905 Einstein knew of Lorentz's work only\nup to 1895. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.10, his proof of the first-order theorem\nfor optical phenomena, his need to supplement this proof with the contraction\nhypothesis, and, finally, his new postulate of the Lorentz force, Eq.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned.' Note that it is, of\ncourse, not necessary for the interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment\nto know what e is. In these works, the aether questions are central. The\nvelocity of light as a limiting velocity had been conjectured. But prior to 1905 there\nwas no relativity theory. He had published a book\non optics in 1889 [P10] and one on electromagnetic theory in 1901 [Pll].\nThe June paper begins with the remark that neither the aberration of light and\nrelated phenomena nor the work of Michelson reveals any evidence for an absolute\nmotion of the earth.\nI shall return later to the efforts by Lorentz in 1904 and by Poincare in 1905\nto give a theory of the electron.\nAs a last step preparatory to the account of Einstein's discovery of relativity, I\nshould like to mention what little we know about his thoughts on the subject prior\nto 1905.* In 1895 Einstein sent a manuscript entitled Uber die\nUntersuchung des Atherzustandes im magnetischen Felde (On the Examination\nof the State of the Aether in a Magnetic Field) to his uncle Caesar Koch in Bel-\ngium. Evidently Einstein believed in an\naether at that time. At any rate, it is evident that at\nthat time he already knew that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon but did\nnot yet know Maxwell's papers. 'He\nencountered at once, in his second year of college [1897-8], the problem of light,\nether and the earth's movement. A letter by Einstein to Grossmann, written in\n1901 from Winterthur, informs us that aether drift experiments were still on Ein-\nstein's mind: 'A new and considerably simpler method for investigating the motion\nof matter relative to the light-aether has occurred to me.\nThis letter also shows that Einstein still believed in an aether as late as 1901. On the evening of December 5, 1903, Albert Einstein,\ntechnical expert third class with provisional appointment, held a lecture in the\nconference room of the Hotel Storchen in Bern before the Naturforschende\nGesellschaft Bern.\n'I then thought I would want to prove experimentally to myself in any way the\nflow of the aether to the earth, that is to say, the motion of the earth. In those days\nwhen this problem arose in my mind, I had no doubt as to the existence of the\naether and the motion of the earth in it. Even with this admonition in mind, it would seem that\nthe following is a fair summary of Einstein's work and thoughts on electrody-\nnamics prior to 1905. At least twice he had an idea for a new experi-\nmental method to measure the aether drift. He knew of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment which, however, was not as crucial to his formu-\nlation of special relativity as were the first-order effects, the aberration of light,\nand the Fresnel drag [S6, Ol]. He knew the 1895 paper of Lorentz in which the\nMichelson-Morley experiment is discussed at length. Lorentz, November 10, 1894. Livingston, Science 63, 105 (1926). , Aether and Matter. Maxwell, Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th edn. Morley, Am. Morley and D. Morley, Am.", "Electromagnetic_Theory_1905": " The Michelson-Morley Experiment\nMaxwell's article Ether, written for the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britan-\nnica [Ml], begins with an enumeration of the 'high metaphysical .' This contribution by Maxwell is an important document for numerous\nreasons. To mention but three, it shows us that, like his contemporaries, Maxwell\nwas deeply convinced of the reality of some sort of aether: 'There can be no doubt\nthat the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty but are occupied by\na material substance or body, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most\nuniform, body of which we have any knowledge'; it tells us of an unsuccessful\nattempt by Maxwell himself to perform a terrestrial optical experiment aimed at\ndetecting the influence of an aether drag on the earth's motion; and it informs us\nof his opinion that effects of the second order in v/c (v = velocity of the earth\nrelative to the aether, c = velocity of light) are too small to be detectable. On March\n19, 1879, Maxwell sent a letter of thanks in which he referred Todd to his ency-\nclopedia article and in particular reiterated his remark on the second-order nature\nof terrestrial experiments. After Maxwell's death, the letter was forwarded to the secretary of the\nRoyal Society, who saw to its publication in the January 29,1880, issue of Nature\n[M2]. Michelson, then on leave from the Navy\nand doing post-graduate work in Helmholtz's laboratory in Berlin, had read\nMaxwell's 1879 letter. Being already an acknowledged expert on measurements\nof the velocity of light (he had by then published three papers on the subject [L2]),\nhe had concluded that Maxwell had underrated the accuracy with which terres-\ntrial experiments could be performed. In his\narrangement a stationary aether would yield a time difference corresponding to\nabout an extra 1 /25 of a wavelength of yellow light traveling in the parallel direc-\ntion, an effect that can be detected by letting the transverse and parallel beams\ninterfere. The paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment came out the\nfollowing November [M6]. In 1892 Lorentz queried Rayleigh: 'Can there be some\npoint in the theory of Mr Michelson's experiment which had as yet been over-\nlooked. In a lecture before the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, Kelvin\nreferred to the experiment as 'carried out with most searching care to secure a\ntrustworthy result' and characterized its outcome as a nineteenth century cloud\nover the dynamic theory of light [Kl]. In 1904 he wrote in the preface to his\nBaltimore lectures: 'Michelson and Morley have by their great experimental work\non the motion of the ether relatively to the earth raised the one and only serious\nobjection against our dynamical explanations.\nLet us now move back to the times when Einstein was still virtually unknown\nand ask how Michelson reacted to Einstein's special theory of relativity and what\ninfluence the Michelson-Morley experiment had on Einstein's formulation of\nthat theory in 1905. You uncovered\nan insidious defect in the ether theory of light, as it then existed, and stimulated\nthe ideas of H. Lorentz and FitzGerald out of which the special theory of\nrelativity developed' [E10]. Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S. Lorentz's decisive investigation of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (1895) with which I was acquainted before developing the spe-\ncial theory of relativity. It shows that the principal argument\nwhich ultimately led him to the special theory was not so much the need to resolve\nthe conflict between the Michelson-Morley result and the version of aether theory\nprevalent in the late nineteenth century but rather, independent of the Michelson-\nMorley experiment, the rejection of this nineteenth century edifice as inherently\nunconvincing and artificial.\nLorentz discussed both effects from the point of view of electromagnetic theory\nand gave a dynamic derivation of the Fresnel drag in terms of the polarization\ninduced in a medium by incident electromagnetic waves.* Throughout this paper\nof 1895, the Fresnel aether is postulated explicitly. In rejecting these explanations\nof aberration and the Fizeau experiment, Einstein therefore chose to take leave of\na first-order terra firma which had been established by the practitioners, limited\nin number but highly eminent and influential, of electromagnetic theory. Note also that this experiment was\ndiscussed at length in Lorentz's paper of 1895 and that Einstein was familiar with\nthis paper before 1905. I had just a chance to\nread Lorentz's 1895 monograph, in which he had succeeded in giving a com-\nprehensive solution to problems of electrodynamics within the first approxi-\nmation, in other words, as far as the quantities of higher order than the square\nof the velocity of a moving body to that of light were neglected. Historical accounts of electromagnetism in the late\nnineteenth century almost invariably cite a single phrase written by that excellent\nexperimental and theoretical physicist, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz: 'Maxwell's theory\nis Maxwell's system of equations.\nThe post-Maxwell, pre-Einstein attitude which eventually became preponderant\nwas that electrodynamics is Maxwell's equations plus a specification of the charge\nand current densities contained in these equations plus a conjecture on the nature\nof the aether.\nMaxwell's own theory placed the field concept in a central position. Rather, 'many\nworkers and many thinkers have helped to build up the nineteenth century school\nof plenum, one ether for light, heat, electricity, magnetism', as Kelvin wrote in\n1893 [K3]. However, there still were many nineteenth century candidates for this\none aether, some but not all predating Maxwell's theory. Indeed, his\ndictum referred to earlier reads more fully: 'Maxwell's theory is Maxwell's system\nof equations. Every theory which leads to the same system of equations, and there-\nfore comprises the same possible phenomena, I would consider as being a form or\nspecial case of Maxwell's theory.'\nThe most important question for all these authors of aethers and makers of\nMaxwell theories was to find a dynamic understanding of the aberration of light,\nof Fresnel drag, and, later, of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Einstein's theory is, of course, not just a\nMaxwell theory in the sense of Hertz. Nor shall I discuss Lorentz's finest contribution, his\natomistic interpretation of the Maxwell equations in terms of charges and currents\ncarried by fundamental particles (which he called charged particles in 1892, ions\nin 1895, and, finally, electrons in 1899), even though this work represents such a\nmajor advance in the development of electrodynamics. As he repeatedly pointed out else-\nwhere, in 1905 he knew Lorentz's work only up to 1895. It follows\u2014as we shall\nsee\u2014that in 1905 Einstein did not know of Lorentz transformations. Indeed, Lorentz's Columbia University lectures, given in 1906 and published\nin book form in 1909, contain the following comment: 'In a paper . (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether. already then [in 1887]\nsome results were found which later were obtained from the electromagnetic the-\nory' [V4]. The collected papers of the Irish physicist George Francis\nFitzGerald, edited by his friend Joseph Larmor [L8], show that FitzGerald\nbelonged to that small and select group of physicists who participated very early\nin the further development of Maxwell's theory. (In 1899, he was awarded a\nRoyal Medal for his work in optics and electrodynamics by the Royal Society, of\nwhich he was a member. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3].

He had published a book\non optics in 1889 [P10] and one on electromagnetic theory in 1901 [Pll]. In 1895\nhe had written a series of papers on Maxwellian theories [P12].

Alas, I never asked Fokker (an ex-student of\nLorentz's) what Lorentz himself had to say on that subject.' Turning to theoretical ideas, he noted that the Lorentz theory\n'is the most satisfactory one we have. Lorentz\ntransformations had been written down.

To Lorentz himself he wrote, 'You will surely feel that I feel an\nunbounded admiration for you' [E10]. The special\ntheory was a more detailed expose of those concepts which are found in Lorentz's\nresearch of 1895'[Ell].\nLorentz's life centered on Arnhem, Leiden, and Haarlem.\nLorentz's esteem for Einstein was extremely high as well. In Chapter 12, I\nshall have more to relate about the interactions between these two men at the time\nthat Lorentz almost got Einstein to accept a permanent position in Holland. This led the Dutch\nprofessor Lorentz and myself to develop the theory of special relativity . Lorentz und H. The task of speaking about Lorentz and Poincare fell to Born (who\nhad attended Poincare's Goettingen lecture).**\nTwo months before his death, Einstein gave his fair and final judgment:\n'Lorentz had already recognized that the transformations named after him are\nessential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincare deepened this\ninsight still further .

This contribution by Maxwell is an important document for numerous\nreasons. To mention but three, it shows us that, like his contemporaries, Maxwell\nwas deeply convinced of the reality of some sort of aether: 'There can be no doubt\nthat the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty but are occupied by\na material substance or body, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most\nuniform, body of which we have any knowledge'; it tells us of an unsuccessful\nattempt by Maxwell himself to perform a terrestrial optical experiment aimed at\ndetecting the influence of an aether drag on the earth's motion; and it informs us\nof his opinion that effects of the second order in v/c (v = velocity of the earth\nrelative to the aether, c = velocity of light) are too small to be detectable. On March\n19, 1879, Maxwell sent a letter of thanks in which he referred Todd to his ency-\nclopedia article and in particular reiterated his remark on the second-order nature\nof terrestrial experiments. After Maxwell's death, the letter was forwarded to the secretary of the\nRoyal Society, who saw to its publication in the January 29,1880, issue of Nature\n[M2]. Michelson, then on leave from the Navy\nand doing post-graduate work in Helmholtz's laboratory in Berlin, had read\nMaxwell's 1879 letter. Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S. Historical accounts of electromagnetism in the late\nnineteenth century almost invariably cite a single phrase written by that excellent\nexperimental and theoretical physicist, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz: 'Maxwell's theory\nis Maxwell's system of equations.\nThe post-Maxwell, pre-Einstein attitude which eventually became preponderant\nwas that electrodynamics is Maxwell's equations plus a specification of the charge\nand current densities contained in these equations plus a conjecture on the nature\nof the aether. No longer was 'space filled three\nor four times over with ethers,' as Maxwell had complained [Ml]. Nor shall I discuss Lorentz's finest contribution, his\natomistic interpretation of the Maxwell equations in terms of charges and currents\ncarried by fundamental particles (which he called charged particles in 1892, ions\nin 1895, and, finally, electrons in 1899), even though this work represents such a\nmajor advance in the development of electrodynamics. The collected papers of the Irish physicist George Francis\nFitzGerald, edited by his friend Joseph Larmor [L8], show that FitzGerald\nbelonged to that small and select group of physicists who participated very early\nin the further development of Maxwell's theory.\nWe move to 1892, the year in which Lorentz publishes his first paper on his\natomistic electromagnetic theory [L12].

On March\n19, 1879, Maxwell sent a letter of thanks in which he referred Todd to his ency-\nclopedia article and in particular reiterated his remark on the second-order nature\nof terrestrial experiments. Being already an acknowledged expert on measurements\nof the velocity of light (he had by then published three papers on the subject [L2]),\nhe had concluded that Maxwell had underrated the accuracy with which terres-\ntrial experiments could be performed. The method\nhe used was to compare the times it takes for light to travel the same distance\neither parallel or transversely to the earth's motion relative to the aether. In his\narrangement a stationary aether would yield a time difference corresponding to\nabout an extra 1 /25 of a wavelength of yellow light traveling in the parallel direc-\ntion, an effect that can be detected by letting the transverse and parallel beams\ninterfere. For easily accessible details of the experiment I refer the reader to text-\nbooks* and state only Michelson's conclusion: there was no evidence for an aether\nwind. 'The result of the hypothesis of a stationary aether is thus shown to be\nincorrect, and the necessary conclusion follows that the hypothesis is erroneous,'\n[M3]. So did Lorentz, who found\nan error in Michelson's theory of the experiment [L3] and who was dubious about\nthe interpretation of the results [ L4]. Lorentz's misgivings and Rayleigh's urgings\ncontributed to Michelson's decision\u2014he was now at the Case School of Applied\nScience in Cleveland\u2014to repeat his experiment, this time in collaboration with\nEdward Williams Morley, a chemist from next-door Western Reserve University. The paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment came out the\nfollowing November [M6]. In 1892 Lorentz queried Rayleigh: 'Can there be some\npoint in the theory of Mr Michelson's experiment which had as yet been over-\nlooked. In a lecture before the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, Kelvin\nreferred to the experiment as 'carried out with most searching care to secure a\ntrustworthy result' and characterized its outcome as a nineteenth century cloud\nover the dynamic theory of light [Kl]. In 1904 he wrote in the preface to his\nBaltimore lectures: 'Michelson and Morley have by their great experimental work\non the motion of the ether relatively to the earth raised the one and only serious\nobjection against our dynamical explanations. In 1904, Morley and Miller were\nthe first to do a hilltop experiment: 'Some have thought that [the Michelson-Mor-\nley] experiment only proves that the ether in a certain basement room is carried\nalong with it.

The absence of any\nmention of the aether wind experiments in his citation^ is not surprising. It is more interesting that Michelson himself did not mention these\nexperiments in his acceptance speech [Nl]\u2014not quite like Einstein, who\nresponded to the award given him in 1922 for the photoelectric effect by delivering\na lecture on relativity [E4]. Truly revealing, however, is Michelson's verdict on\nrelativity given in 1927 in his book Studies in Optics [Ml2].\nSUBTLE IS THE LORD 115\ntheory of relativity 'must be accorded a generous acceptance' and gave a clear\nexpose of Lorentz transformations and their consequences for the Michelson -\nMorley experiment and for the experiment of Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau\non the velocity of light in streaming water.\nLet us turn to the influence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on Einstein's\ninitial relativity paper [E5]. Michelson and Morley are mentioned in that\nreview, in a semipopular article Einstein wrote in 1915 [E8], again in the Prince-\nton lectures of 1921 [El], and in the book The Meaning of Relativity [E9] (which\ngrew out of the Princeton lectures), where Einstein called the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment the most important one of all the null experiments on the aether drift.\nHowever, neither in the research papers nor in these four reviews does Einstein\never make clear whether before 1905 he knew of the Michelson-Morley experi-\nment. It was you\nwho led the physicists into new paths, and through your marvelous experimental\nwork paved the way for the development of the theory of relativity. You uncovered\nan insidious defect in the ether theory of light, as it then existed, and stimulated\nthe ideas of H. In Pasadena, Einstein had asked Michelson why he had\nspent so much effort on high-precision measurements of the light velocity. Ein-\nstein's main remark about the Michelson-Morley experiment was, 'Its negative\noutcome has much increased the faith in the validity of the general theory of rel-\nativity.\nNevertheless, the answers to both questions\u2014did Einstein know of Michelson's\nwork before 1905. 'When I asked him how he had learned of\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment, he told me that he had become aware of it\nthrough the writings of H. Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S.\" He continued to say that experimental results which had influenced him\nmost were the observations on stellar aberration and Fizeau's measurements on\nthe speed of light in moving water. 'I asked Professor Einstein when he had\nfirst heard of Michelson and his experiment.\nc) December 1952, letter by Einstein to Shankland. 'The influence of the crucial\nMichelson-Morley experiment upon my own efforts has been rather indirect. Lorentz's basic assumption of an ether at rest seemed to\nme not convincing in itself and also for the reason that it was leading to an inter-\npretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment which seemed to me artificial'\n[S7].\nIt seems sensible to attach more value to the later comments, made upon further\nreflection, and therefore to conclude that Einstein did know of Michelson and\nMorley before 1905.\nSecond, there is Einstein's opinion that aberration and the Fizeau experiment\nwere enough for him. It shows that the principal argument\nwhich ultimately led him to the special theory was not so much the need to resolve\nthe conflict between the Michelson-Morley result and the version of aether theory\nprevalent in the late nineteenth century but rather, independent of the Michelson-\nMorley experiment, the rejection of this nineteenth century edifice as inherently\nunconvincing and artificial.' By Einstein's own account, he knew\nthis 1895 memoir in which Lorentz discussed, among other things, both the aber-\nration of light and the Fizeau experiment.\nFresnel derived this result from the assumption that light imparts elastic vibrations\nto the aether it traverses. According to him, the presence of the factor 1 \u2014 \\/n2\n(now known as Fresnel's drag coefficient) expresses the fact that light cannot\nacquire the full additional velocity v since it is partially held back by the aether\nin the tube.* Throughout this paper\nof 1895, the Fresnel aether is postulated explicitly. Note, however,\nthat it was easy to take the Michelson-Morley experiments for granted (as Ein-\nstein repeatedly said he did) once a new look at the first-order effects had led to\nthe new logic of the special theory of relativity. Note also that this experiment was\ndiscussed at length in Lorentz's paper of 1895 and that Einstein was familiar with\nthis paper before 1905.Il8 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nThe concept of an aether at absolute rest, introduced in 1818 by Fresnel in his\ncelebrated letter to Dominique Francois Jean Arago [Fl], served the express pur-\npose of explaining this aberration effect (which would be zero if the aether moved\nalong with the earth). As to the Fizeau effect, Fresnel had predicted that if a liquid\nis moving through a tube with a velocity v relative to the aether and if a light\nbeam traverses the tube in the same direction, then the net light velocity c' in the\nlaboratory is given by\n'SUBTLE is THE LORD' 119\nto take account of the motion of the earth relative to the aether, if we recognized\nthe experimental result as a fact.\nIn his first paper on relativity, Einstein mentions 'the failed attempts to detect\na motion of the earth relative to the \"light-medium\" ' without specifying what\nattempts he had in mind. Einstein's discontent with earlier explanations of first-order effects\nmay have made the mystery of Michelson and Morley's second-order null effect\nless central to him. There were the aethers\nof Fresnel, Gauchy, Stokes, Neumann, MacCulIagh, Kelvin, Planck, and proba-\nbly others, distinguished by such properties as degree of homogeneity and com-\n*In a thoughtful article on Einstein and the Michelson-Morley experiment, Holton [H2] raised the\npossibility that Einstein might have had in mind other null effects known by then, such as the absence\nof double refraction [B2, Rl] and the Trouton-Noble experiment [Tl].\n**See the second volume of Hertz's collected works [H3], which is also available in English trans-\nlation [H4],\n120 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\npressibility, and the extent to which the earth dragged the aether along.'\nThe most important question for all these authors of aethers and makers of\nMaxwell theories was to find a dynamic understanding of the aberration of light,\nof Fresnel drag, and, later, of the Michelson-Morley experiment. It follows\u2014as we shall\nsee\u2014that in 1905 Einstein did not know of Lorentz transformations. In 1887 or 1888, the two men\ncorresponded\u2014about the Michelson-Morley experiment [V3]. (Although these lines were writ-\nten after Einstein's work of 1905, they still contain a reference to the aether. already then [in 1887]\nsome results were found which later were obtained from the electromagnetic the-\nory' [V4]. Michelson and Morley's wonderfully\ndelicate experiment attempting to decide the important question as to how far\nthe ether is carried along by the earth. I would suggest that almost the only hypothesis that can\nreconcile this opposition is that the length of material bodies changes, according\nas they are moving through the ether or across it, by an amount depending on\nthe square of the ratio of their velocities to that of light. In a review of this book, FitzGerald wrote that in the\nanalysis of the Michelson-Morley experiment 'he [Larmor] has to assume that\nthe length of a body depends on whether it is moving lengthwise or sideways\nthrough the ether' [Lll], without referring, however, to his own suggestion made\nmore than ten years earlier. Lorentz. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3]. The main purpose of Lorentz's paper was to examine how well Fresnel's\nstationary aether fitted the facts. He therefore reexamined the aberration and\nFizeau effects and noted in particular another achievement (not yet mentioned) of\nMichelson and Morley: their repetition of the Fizeau experiment with much\ngreater accuracy, which bore out Fresnel's prediction for the drag coefficient in a\nmuch more quantitative way than was known before [M17]. Since at that time\nLorentz had a right to be dubious about the precision of the Potsdam experiment,\nhe concluded that there was no particular source for worry: 'It seems doubtful in\nmy opinion that the hypothesis of Fresnel has been refuted by experiment' [L3]. The Michelson-Morley experiment has\nmeanwhile been performed, and Lorentz is now deeply concerned (as was noted\nbefore): 'This experiment has been puzzling me for a long time, and in the end I\nhave been able to think of only one means of reconciling it with Fresnel's theory. In order to interpret this result, Lorentz assumed that molecular forces, like\nelectromagnetic forces, 'act by means of an intervention of the aether' and that a\ncontraction effect O(v2/c2) cannot be excluded on any known experimental\ngrounds.10) only as a convenient mathematical tool for proving a physical theorem, in\nhis case that to O(v/c) terrestrial optical experiments are independent of the\nmotion of the earth, a result already mentioned in Section 6a.\nAs has been noted repeatedly, in 1905 Einstein knew of Lorentz's work only\nup to 1895. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.10, his proof of the first-order theorem\nfor optical phenomena, his need to supplement this proof with the contraction\nhypothesis, and, finally, his new postulate of the Lorentz force, Eq.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned.' Note that it is, of\ncourse, not necessary for the interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment\nto know what e is. In these works, the aether questions are central. The\nvelocity of light as a limiting velocity had been conjectured. But prior to 1905 there\nwas no relativity theory. He had published a book\non optics in 1889 [P10] and one on electromagnetic theory in 1901 [Pll].\nThe June paper begins with the remark that neither the aberration of light and\nrelated phenomena nor the work of Michelson reveals any evidence for an absolute\nmotion of the earth.\nI shall return later to the efforts by Lorentz in 1904 and by Poincare in 1905\nto give a theory of the electron.\nAs a last step preparatory to the account of Einstein's discovery of relativity, I\nshould like to mention what little we know about his thoughts on the subject prior\nto 1905.* In 1895 Einstein sent a manuscript entitled Uber die\nUntersuchung des Atherzustandes im magnetischen Felde (On the Examination\nof the State of the Aether in a Magnetic Field) to his uncle Caesar Koch in Bel-\ngium. Evidently Einstein believed in an\naether at that time. In his final autobiographical note [El2], Einstein\nwrote, 'During that year [sometime between October 1895 and the early fall of\n1896] in Aarau the question came to me: If one runs after a light wave with [a\nvelocity equal to the] light velocity, then one would encounter a time-independent\nwavefield. 'He\nencountered at once, in his second year of college [1897-8], the problem of light,\nether and the earth's movement. He wanted to con-\nstruct an apparatus which would accurately measure the earth's movement against\nthe ether. A letter by Einstein to Grossmann, written in\n1901 from Winterthur, informs us that aether drift experiments were still on Ein-\nstein's mind: 'A new and considerably simpler method for investigating the motion\nof matter relative to the light-aether has occurred to me.\nThis letter also shows that Einstein still believed in an aether as late as 1901. On the evening of December 5, 1903, Albert Einstein,\ntechnical expert third class with provisional appointment, held a lecture in the\nconference room of the Hotel Storchen in Bern before the Naturforschende\nGesellschaft Bern.\n'I then thought I would want to prove experimentally to myself in any way the\nflow of the aether to the earth, that is to say, the motion of the earth. In those days\nwhen this problem arose in my mind, I had no doubt as to the existence of the\naether and the motion of the earth in it. Even with this admonition in mind, it would seem that\nthe following is a fair summary of Einstein's work and thoughts on electrody-\nnamics prior to 1905. At least twice he had an idea for a new experi-\nmental method to measure the aether drift. He knew of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment which, however, was not as crucial to his formu-\nlation of special relativity as were the first-order effects, the aberration of light,\nand the Fresnel drag [S6, Ol]. He knew the 1895 paper of Lorentz in which the\nMichelson-Morley experiment is discussed at length. Lorentz, November 10, 1894. Livingston, Science 63, 105 (1926). , Aether and Matter. Morley, Am.

The better light was understood, the more circumscribed became the\nproperties of its medium, the aether. When light turned out to be a transverse wave phe-\nnomenon, the aether had to be declared quasi-rigid.\nThe special theory of relativity divested the aether of its principal mechanical\nproperty, absolute rest, and thereby made the aether redundant. As Einstein put\nit in the introduction to his June 1905 paper (referred to in this chapter as the\nJune paper), 'the introduction of a \"light-aether\" will prove to be superfluous\nsince, according to the view to be developed [here], neither will a \"space in abso-\nlute rest\" endowed with special properties be introduced nor will a velocity vector\nbe associated with a point of empty space in which electromagnetic processes take\nplace' [El]., El, the\nfourth paper Einstein published in 1905] is available only in draft form and is an\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies in which use is made of a modification of the\ntenets about space and time; the purely kinematic part of this work will surely\ninterest you' [E2].\nIn 1905 Einstein's belief in 'the truth of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations' was\nnot unqualified, as we shall see later. It was strong enough, however, for him to\nperceive the conflict between the constancy of the velocity of light (in the vacuum)\n140 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nand the relativity principle of classical mechanics. In the June paper, he gave two\nconcrete reasons for this view: first, the absence of experimental evidence for an\naether drift and second, the existence of 'asymmetries which do not appear to be\ninherent in the phenomena.\nI argued in Chapter 6 that Einstein rejected the nineteenth century explanations\nof the first-order aether drift effects as unconvincing and artificial and that the\nsecond-order Michelson-Morley paradox was to some extent secondary to him.\nFitzGerald and Lorentz had already seen that the explanation of the Michel-\nson-Morley experiment demanded the introduction of a new postulate, the con-\ntraction hypothesis., the Michel-\nson-Morley result, which Einstein did mention for the first time in this 1907\npaper].

Einstein Centennial Symposium at Princeton, 1979,\np.", "Morley_1905": " The Michelson-Morley Experiment\nMaxwell's article Ether, written for the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britan-\nnica [Ml], begins with an enumeration of the 'high metaphysical . To mention but three, it shows us that, like his contemporaries, Maxwell\nwas deeply convinced of the reality of some sort of aether: 'There can be no doubt\nthat the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty but are occupied by\na material substance or body, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most\nuniform, body of which we have any knowledge'; it tells us of an unsuccessful\nattempt by Maxwell himself to perform a terrestrial optical experiment aimed at\ndetecting the influence of an aether drag on the earth's motion; and it informs us\nof his opinion that effects of the second order in v/c (v = velocity of the earth\nrelative to the aether, c = velocity of light) are too small to be detectable. Some speak of\naether, others of ether. The method\nhe used was to compare the times it takes for light to travel the same distance\neither parallel or transversely to the earth's motion relative to the aether. In his\narrangement a stationary aether would yield a time difference corresponding to\nabout an extra 1 /25 of a wavelength of yellow light traveling in the parallel direc-\ntion, an effect that can be detected by letting the transverse and parallel beams\ninterfere. Lorentz's misgivings and Rayleigh's urgings\ncontributed to Michelson's decision\u2014he was now at the Case School of Applied\nScience in Cleveland\u2014to repeat his experiment, this time in collaboration with\nEdward Williams Morley, a chemist from next-door Western Reserve University. The paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment came out the\nfollowing November [M6]. In 1892 Lorentz queried Rayleigh: 'Can there be some\npoint in the theory of Mr Michelson's experiment which had as yet been over-\nlooked. In a lecture before the Royal Institution on April 27, 1900, Kelvin\nreferred to the experiment as 'carried out with most searching care to secure a\ntrustworthy result' and characterized its outcome as a nineteenth century cloud\nover the dynamic theory of light [Kl]. In 1904 he wrote in the preface to his\nBaltimore lectures: 'Michelson and Morley have by their great experimental work\non the motion of the ether relatively to the earth raised the one and only serious\nobjection against our dynamical explanations. In 1904, Morley and Miller were\nthe first to do a hilltop experiment: 'Some have thought that [the Michelson-Mor-\nley] experiment only proves that the ether in a certain basement room is carried\nalong with it.\nLet us now move back to the times when Einstein was still virtually unknown\nand ask how Michelson reacted to Einstein's special theory of relativity and what\ninfluence the Michelson-Morley experiment had on Einstein's formulation of\nthat theory in 1905. The absence of any\nmention of the aether wind experiments in his citation^ is not surprising.\nSUBTLE IS THE LORD 115\ntheory of relativity 'must be accorded a generous acceptance' and gave a clear\nexpose of Lorentz transformations and their consequences for the Michelson -\nMorley experiment and for the experiment of Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau\non the velocity of light in streaming water.\nLet us turn to the influence of the Michelson-Morley experiment on Einstein's\ninitial relativity paper [E5]. Michelson and Morley are mentioned in that\nreview, in a semipopular article Einstein wrote in 1915 [E8], again in the Prince-\nton lectures of 1921 [El], and in the book The Meaning of Relativity [E9] (which\ngrew out of the Princeton lectures), where Einstein called the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment the most important one of all the null experiments on the aether drift.\nHowever, neither in the research papers nor in these four reviews does Einstein\never make clear whether before 1905 he knew of the Michelson-Morley experi-\nment. Ein-\nstein's main remark about the Michelson-Morley experiment was, 'Its negative\noutcome has much increased the faith in the validity of the general theory of rel-\nativity. 'When I asked him how he had learned of\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment, he told me that he had become aware of it\nthrough the writings of H. Lorentz, but only after 1905 [S.\nc) December 1952, letter by Einstein to Shankland. 'The influence of the crucial\nMichelson-Morley experiment upon my own efforts has been rather indirect. Lorentz's basic assumption of an ether at rest seemed to\nme not convincing in itself and also for the reason that it was leading to an inter-\npretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment which seemed to me artificial'\n[S7].\nIt seems sensible to attach more value to the later comments, made upon further\nreflection, and therefore to conclude that Einstein did know of Michelson and\nMorley before 1905. It shows that the principal argument\nwhich ultimately led him to the special theory was not so much the need to resolve\nthe conflict between the Michelson-Morley result and the version of aether theory\nprevalent in the late nineteenth century but rather, independent of the Michelson-\nMorley experiment, the rejection of this nineteenth century edifice as inherently\nunconvincing and artificial.* Throughout this paper\nof 1895, the Fresnel aether is postulated explicitly. Note, however,\nthat it was easy to take the Michelson-Morley experiments for granted (as Ein-\nstein repeatedly said he did) once a new look at the first-order effects had led to\nthe new logic of the special theory of relativity.Il8 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nThe concept of an aether at absolute rest, introduced in 1818 by Fresnel in his\ncelebrated letter to Dominique Francois Jean Arago [Fl], served the express pur-\npose of explaining this aberration effect (which would be zero if the aether moved\nalong with the earth). As to the Fizeau effect, Fresnel had predicted that if a liquid\nis moving through a tube with a velocity v relative to the aether and if a light\nbeam traverses the tube in the same direction, then the net light velocity c' in the\nlaboratory is given by\n'SUBTLE is THE LORD' 119\nto take account of the motion of the earth relative to the aether, if we recognized\nthe experimental result as a fact. Einstein's discontent with earlier explanations of first-order effects\nmay have made the mystery of Michelson and Morley's second-order null effect\nless central to him. There were the aethers\nof Fresnel, Gauchy, Stokes, Neumann, MacCulIagh, Kelvin, Planck, and proba-\nbly others, distinguished by such properties as degree of homogeneity and com-\n*In a thoughtful article on Einstein and the Michelson-Morley experiment, Holton [H2] raised the\npossibility that Einstein might have had in mind other null effects known by then, such as the absence\nof double refraction [B2, Rl] and the Trouton-Noble experiment [Tl].\n**See the second volume of Hertz's collected works [H3], which is also available in English trans-\nlation [H4],\n120 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\npressibility, and the extent to which the earth dragged the aether along.'\nThe most important question for all these authors of aethers and makers of\nMaxwell theories was to find a dynamic understanding of the aberration of light,\nof Fresnel drag, and, later, of the Michelson-Morley experiment. In 1887 or 1888, the two men\ncorresponded\u2014about the Michelson-Morley experiment [V3]. might therefore have been\n122 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nborrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations\nfor the free ether is contained in his paper' [L7].

Michelson and Morley's wonderfully\ndelicate experiment attempting to decide the important question as to how far\nthe ether is carried along by the earth. In a review of this book, FitzGerald wrote that in the\nanalysis of the Michelson-Morley experiment 'he [Larmor] has to assume that\nthe length of a body depends on whether it is moving lengthwise or sideways\nthrough the ether' [Lll], without referring, however, to his own suggestion made\nmore than ten years earlier. Lorentz. The first paper by Lorentz relevant to the present discussion is\nthe one of 1886\u2014that is, prior to the Michelson-Morley experiment\u2014in which\nhe criticized Michelson's theoretical analysis of the 1881 Potsdam experiment\n[L3]. The main purpose of Lorentz's paper was to examine how well Fresnel's\nstationary aether fitted the facts. He therefore reexamined the aberration and\nFizeau effects and noted in particular another achievement (not yet mentioned) of\nMichelson and Morley: their repetition of the Fizeau experiment with much\ngreater accuracy, which bore out Fresnel's prediction for the drag coefficient in a\nmuch more quantitative way than was known before [M17]. The Michelson-Morley experiment has\nmeanwhile been performed, and Lorentz is now deeply concerned (as was noted\nbefore): 'This experiment has been puzzling me for a long time, and in the end I\nhave been able to think of only one means of reconciling it with Fresnel's theory. Thus Einstein was aware of no more and no less than the following:\nLorentz's concern about the Michelson-Morley experiment, his 'first-order\nLorentz transformation,' Eqs.\nAs a conclusion to the contributions of Lorentz prior to 1905, the following\nthree papers need to be mentioned.\n1899.' Note that it is, of\ncourse, not necessary for the interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment\nto know what e is.\n1904. In these works, the aether questions are central. But prior to 1905 there\nwas no relativity theory. He had published a book\non optics in 1889 [P10] and one on electromagnetic theory in 1901 [Pll].\nJuly, 1905.\nI shall return later to the efforts by Lorentz in 1904 and by Poincare in 1905\nto give a theory of the electron.\nAs a last step preparatory to the account of Einstein's discovery of relativity, I\nshould like to mention what little we know about his thoughts on the subject prior\nto 1905.* In 1895 Einstein sent a manuscript entitled Uber die\nUntersuchung des Atherzustandes im magnetischen Felde (On the Examination\nof the State of the Aether in a Magnetic Field) to his uncle Caesar Koch in Bel-\ngium. Evidently Einstein believed in an\naether at that time. 'He\nencountered at once, in his second year of college [1897-8], the problem of light,\nether and the earth's movement. A letter by Einstein to Grossmann, written in\n1901 from Winterthur, informs us that aether drift experiments were still on Ein-\nstein's mind: 'A new and considerably simpler method for investigating the motion\nof matter relative to the light-aether has occurred to me. On the evening of December 5, 1903, Albert Einstein,\ntechnical expert third class with provisional appointment, held a lecture in the\nconference room of the Hotel Storchen in Bern before the Naturforschende\nGesellschaft Bern. He knew of the\nMichelson-Morley experiment which, however, was not as crucial to his formu-\nlation of special relativity as were the first-order effects, the aberration of light,\nand the Fresnel drag [S6, Ol].

Larmor was\naware of Lorentz's paper of 1895 and quoted it at length, but he could not have\nknown the 1899 paper. However,\nthere is no doubt that he gave the Lorentz transformations and the resulting con-\ntraction argument before Lorentz independently did the same. Alas, I never asked Fokker (an ex-student of\nLorentz's) what Lorentz himself had to say on that subject. Lorentz\ntransformations had been written down.

Electromagnetic Mass: The First Century*\nLong before it was known that the equivalence of energy and inertial mass is a\nnecessary consequence of the relativity postulates and that this equivalence applies\nto all forms of energy, long before it was known that the separate conservation\nlaws of energy and of mass merge into one, there was a time when dynamic rather\nthan kinematic arguments led to the notion of electromagnetic mass, a form of\nenergy arising specifically in the case of a charged particle coupled to its own\nelectromagnetic field. The electromagnetic mass concept celebrates its first centen-\nnial as these lines are written.\n'A close analogy to this question of electromagnetic mass is furnished by a sim-\nple hydrodynamic problem,' Lorentz told his listeners at Columbia University\nearly in 1906 [L8].' Thus he discovered the electromagnetic mass /i, though he did not\ngive it that name.

In his July 1905 memoir he added, 'This pressure is proportional to the\nfourth power of the experimental mass of the electron' [P15]. Assume further\u2014as Poincare did\u2014that the mass of the elec-\ntron is purely electromagnetic. Recently, unified field theories have taught us that the mass of the elec-\ntron is certainly not purely electromagnetic in nature. Einstein, AdP 17, 891 (1905). , Science 80, 358 (1934).

When light turned out to be a transverse wave phe-\nnomenon, the aether had to be declared quasi-rigid.\nThe special theory of relativity divested the aether of its principal mechanical\nproperty, absolute rest, and thereby made the aether redundant. As Einstein put\nit in the introduction to his June 1905 paper (referred to in this chapter as the\nJune paper), 'the introduction of a \"light-aether\" will prove to be superfluous\nsince, according to the view to be developed [here], neither will a \"space in abso-\nlute rest\" endowed with special properties be introduced nor will a velocity vector\nbe associated with a point of empty space in which electromagnetic processes take\nplace' [El]. This invariance\nof the velocity of light was, however, in conflict with the rule of addition of veloc-\nities we knew of well in mechanics.

Others in Einstein's position might perhaps have chosen to mention Poincare\nat the earliest opportunity. I shall return soon to what Einstein had to\nsay about Poincare in later years. Here I note that Poincare's name appears only\nonce in a paper by Einstein on relativity, to wit, in 'Geometric und Erfahrung,'\nthe text of a lecture he gave in 1921 on general relativity [E7] in which he praises\n'der tiefe und scharfsinnige Poincare,' the deep and sharp-witted P.

It is inconceivable that Poincare would have studied Ein-\nstein's papers of 1905 without understanding them.** It is apparent once again that Poincare either never under-\nstood or else never accepted the special theory of relativity.\nAn additional mention of Poincare's pioneering ideas might have been gracious.

He was forty-four\nyears old when he attended his first international physics conference, just across\nthe Dutch border. Poincare and Einstein.\nAlexander Moszkowski begins his biography of Einstein [ M2] by recalling that\non October 13,1910, Poincare gave a lecture before the Berliner Wissenschaftliche\nVerein about 'die neue Mechanik' (Poincare was quite comfortable with the Ger-\nman language).\nEinstein and Poincare met (for the first and last time, I believe) at the first\nSolvay Conference, held in Brussels in October 1911. He does not remain attached to the classical principles and,\nfaced with a physics problem, promptly envisages all possibilities.\nIn 1919, the mathematician Mittag-Leffler wrote to Einstein, asking him to\ncontribute an article to the Ada Mathematica volume in honor of Poincare [M3]. I even do not remember if I knew of\nit at all when I wrote my first paper on the subject (1905).\nJust over twenty years before Einstein wrote this late letter, just under twenty\nyears after his creation of the special theory, he gave a lecture at Oxford entitled\n'On the Method of Theoretical Physics' [E20], in the course of which he said, 'It\nis my conviction that pure mathematical construction enables us to discover the\nconcepts and the laws connecting them, which give us the key to the understanding\nof the phenomena of Nature.

'I spent ten years of my life testing that\n1905 equation of Einstein's and contrary to all my expectations, I was compelled\nin 1915 to assert its unambiguous verification in spite of its unreasonableness,\nsince it seemed to violate everything we knew about the interference of light' [Ml].\nPhysics had progressed, and Millikan had mellowed since the days of his 1915\npaper on the photoeffect, as is evidenced by what he wrote at that earlier time:\n'Einstein's photoelectric equation . Nor was Millikan at that time the only first-rate\nphysicist to hold such views, as will presently be recalled. As one of the architects of the pre-1925\nquantum theory, the \"old\" quantum theory, Einstein had quickly found both\nenthusiastic and powerful support for one of his two major contributions to this\nfield: the quantum theory of specific heat.) By sharp contrast, from 1905 to\n1923, he was a man apart in being the only one, or almost the only one, to take\nthe light-quantum seriously.\n357\n358 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nThe critical reaction to Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis of 1905 is of great\nimportance for an understanding of the early developments in quantum physics.\nIt was also a reaction without parallel in Einstein's scientific career. In regard to the quantum theory,\nhowever, Einstein almost constantly stood apart, from 1905 until his death. It is true that\nhe was forever critical of quantum mechanics, but at the same time he had his\nown alternative program for a synthetic theory in which particles, fields, and\nquantum phenomena all would find their place. Einstein pursued this program\nfrom about 1920 (before the discovery of quantum mechanics.\nBut let me first return to the days of the old quantum theory. In 1905 Einstein discovered light-quanta without\nusing Planck's law. The\ninterplay between the ideas of Planck and Einstein is discussed. In 1906 Einstein\ncompleted the first paper on quantum effects in the solid state. Einstein's role in these developments is dis-\ncussed in Chapter 21, which begins with Einstein's formulation in 1909 of the\nparticle-wave duality for the case of electromagnetic radiation and also contains\nan account of his discovery of the A and B coefficients and of his earliest concern\nwith the breakdown of classical causality.\nThe reader may wonder why the man who discovered the relation E = hv for\nlight in 1905 and who propounded the special theory of relativity in that same\nyear would not have stated sooner the relation p = hv/c.\n(e) Einstein's role as a key transitional figure in the discovery of wave\nmechanics will be discussed in Chapter 24.\nI shall continue the outline of Einstein's contributions to the quantum theory\nin Section 18c. First, however, I should like to take leave of our main character\nfor a brief while in order to comment on the singular role of the photon in the\nhistory of the physics of particles and fields. Particle Physics: The First Fifty Years\nLet us leave aside the photon for a while and ask how physicists reacted to the\nexperimental discovery or the theoretical prediction (whichever came first) of other\nnew particles.\nThen there was the positron, 'a new kind of particle, unknown to experimental\nphysics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron' [Dl].

Their far more important debate on the foundations of\nquantum mechanics began in 1927.\nThis debate will be one of the themes of Chapter 25, which deals with Einstein's\nobjections to quantum mechanics.\nSo it was in the case of quantum mechanics. Among these, there is one that was most dear to\nEinstein and with which he (and all of us to date) struggled in vain: the synthesis\nof quantum physics with general relativity.

Einstein's first paper on the subject [El], submitted in November 1906,\ncontains the qualitatively correct explanation of an anomaly that had been\nobserved as early as 1840: the low value of the specific heat of diamond at room\ntemperature. It was also known well before\n1906 that specific heats of gases exhibited even more curious properties.\n389\nThe first published graph dealing with the quantum theory of the solid state: Einstein's\nexpression for the specific heat of solids [given in Eq.* Matters got more serious in 1840, when two Swiss\nphysicists, Auguste de la Rive and Francois Marcet, reported on studies of carbon. At almost the same time, diamond was also being studied by Henri Victor\nRegnault, who more than any other physicist contributed to the experimental\ninvestigations of specific heats in the nineteenth century.\n**Weber was Einstein's teacher, whom we encountered in Chapter 3.*\nIn 1872, not only Weber, but also a second physicist, made the conjecture that\nthe Dulong-Petit value c ~ 6 would be reached by carbon at high temperatures:\nJames Dewar. His work is included in a\ndetailed compilation by Alfred Wigand [W3] of the literature on the specific heats\nof solid elements that appeared in the same issue of the Annalen der Physik as\nEinstein's first paper on the quantum theory of specific heats. We are therefore\nup to date in regard to the experimental developments preceding Einstein's work. Einstein was the first one to state\nthis fact clearly. Even though this is a topic that does\nnot directly bear on Einstein's work in 1906, I believe it will be useful to complete\nthe nineteenth century picture with a brief explanation of why gases caused so\nmuch more aggravation. [M2]\nMaxwell's conundrum was the mystery of the missing vibrations. Einstein's work on specific heats [El] is above all\nimportant because it made clear for the first time that quantum concepts have a\nfar more general applicability. His 1906 paper is also unusual because here we\nmeet an Einstein who is quite prepared to use a model he knows to be approxi-\nmate in order to bring home a point of principle.\nEarlier in 1906 Einstein had come to accept Planck's relation (Eq. Einstein applied Eq. Apparently Einstein was not aware of these data in\n1906 (although they were noted in that year by German physicists [W3]). Einstein had ended his active research on the specific heats of\nsolids by the time the work of Debye and the more exact treatment of lattice\nvibrations by Max Born and Theodore von Karman appeared [B7].

In 1906 Einstein gave the first example of a theory that\nimplies that cv \u2014\u00bb 0 as T \u2014> 0 for solids. In 1910 Nernst noted the compatibility\nof Einstein's result with 'the heat theorem developed by me.' However, it was\nactually Planck who, later in 1910, took a step that 'not only in form but also in\ncontent goes a bit beyond [the formulation given by] Nernst himself.\nNernst's reference to Einstein in his paper of 1910 was the first occasion on\n*Simon has given an excellent historical survey of this development [S2j.\nEINSTEIN AND SPECIFIC HEATS 399\nwhich he acknowledged the quantum theory in his publications.

In later years all three men, Einstein, Lorentz, and\nPoincare, reacted to the special theory of relativity in ways which arouse curiosity. Why did Poincare never understand special relativity. Though their concerns may not have been as profound\nas relativity, I often found it baffling to answer such questions as those just raised. Return-\ning to Einstein, Lorentz, and Poincare, the questions I raised about them are the\nresult of patient reading of their papers. Einstein and the Literature. In agreeing to review relativity theory, Ein-\nstein wrote to Stark, 'I should note that unfortunately I am not in a position to\norient myself about everything that has been published on this subject, because\nthe library is closed in my free time. Thus neither Einstein nor Stark\nwas aware of Poincare's long paper bearing on relativity, completed in July 1905\nand published in the 1906 volume of Rendiconti del Circolo matematico di\nPalermo [PI].\nHowever, in view of the fact that the questions under consideration are treated\nhere from a new point of view, I believed I could dispense with a literature search\nwhich would be very troublesome for me, especially since it is to be hoped that\nother authors will fill this gap, as was commendably done by Herr Planck and\nHerr Kaufmann on the occasion of my first paper on the principle of relativity'\n[E5].**\nThe period during which Einstein was unaware of Poincare's technical writing\non relativity now stretches into 1908. I would not be surprised if Einstein had copied\nthat reference from one of Lorentz's papers. Also, in 1906 Einstein mentioned [E6] a paper by\nPoincare [P2] which came to his attention because it appeared in a Festschrift for Lorentz.\nl66 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nall orders in v/c and also in which critical comments are made on the naive use\nof simultaneity. It cannot be said, however, that the content of Einstein's June\n1905 paper depends in any technical sense on these important remarks by Poin-\ncare. However, it does not seem to me that Einstein had\ncompelling reasons to do so in 1905. I shall return soon to what Einstein had to\nsay about Poincare in later years. Here I note that Poincare's name appears only\nonce in a paper by Einstein on relativity, to wit, in 'Geometric und Erfahrung,'\nthe text of a lecture he gave in 1921 on general relativity [E7] in which he praises\n'der tiefe und scharfsinnige Poincare,' the deep and sharp-witted P. Lorentz and the Aether.\nLorentz's words about Kaufmann are found in his 1906 Columbia lectures, the\npublication of which was held up for three years 'on account of my wish to give\nsome further development to the subject' [L2]. Despite this considerable delay,\n'Einstein's principle of relativity [has not] received an adequate treatment' [L2].\n'It is certainly remarkable that these relativity concepts, also those concerning\ntime, have found such a rapid acceptance. As far as this\nlecturer is concerned, he finds a certain satisfaction in the older interpretations,\naccording to which the aether possesses at least some substantiality, space and time\ncan be sharply separated, and simultaneity without further specification can be\nspoken of.\n'Finally, it should be noted that the daring assertion that one can never observe\nvelocities larger than the velocity of light contains a hypothetical restriction of\nwhat is accessible to us, [a restriction] which cannot be accepted without some\nreservation. Light moves with a velocity c km/s.\nAs I understand Lorentz, he was a leader in theoretical physics who fully\ngrasped all the physical and mathematical aspects of the special theory of relativity\nbut who nevertheless could not quite take leave of a beloved classical past.' Lorentz never fully made the transition from the old dynamics\nto the new kinematics. In the last of these, entitled 'La Mecanique\nNouvelle,' the lecturer dealt with questions bearing on relativity. The\nsecond is (I use modern language) that the laws of physics shall be the same in all\ninertial frames.\nl68 RELATIVITY, THE SPECIAL THEORY\nneeds to make still a third hypothesis, much more surprising, much more difficult\nto accept, one which is of much hindrance to what we are currently used to.' It is evident that as late as 1909 Poincare did not\nknow that the contraction of rods is a consequence of the two Einstein postulates.\nPoincare therefore did not understand one of the most basic traits of special\nrelativity. It is likewise the case in a\nsemipopular account of relativity which Poincare wrote in 1908 [P5].\nMy own assessment of Poincare's contributions to relativity coincides with what\nwas said about him during the opening remarks of the meeting in Paris of the\nSociete Francaise de Philosophic, referred to earlier: 'The solution anticipated by\nPoincare was given by Einstein in his memoir of 1905 on special relativity. Whittaker and the History of Relativity. His treatment of the special theory of relativity in the latter volume\nshows how well the author's lack of physical insight matches his ignorance of the\nliterature.

Twice, having met Einstein and written this letter, did he comment on\nrelativity [P7, P8].

On\nSeptember 25, 1907, Einstein had accepted this invitation [E4]. Since this second part contains the remarks on\ngravitation, it seems most probable that Einstein's 'happiest thought' came to him\nsometime in November 1907.

In 1907 and 1911 Einstein had stretched the kine-\nmatic approach to gravitation to its limits. This time he embarked on one of the\nhardest problems of the century: to find the new gravitational dynamics.

Hence, there is a coupling between the gravitational\nfield and the electromagnetic field. However, the latter is not static in general,\nwhereas the gravitational field is static by assumption. since the electromagnetic field might be able to influence the\ngravitational field in such a way that the latter is no longer a static field.

This led him to the final equation for his field c:\nHe went on to show that the second term in the brackets is the gravitational field\nenergy density and that the inclusion of this new term guaranteed validity of the\nconservation laws. From then on, he was prepared for a nonlinear theory of the\ngravitational field. He understood that the sources of the gravitational field were not just\nponderable matter but also field energy.

On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44]. At that time he had given a proof of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian. He had realized meanwhile that this proof 'rested on\nmisconception,' and so, he continued, 'I was led back to a more general covariance\nof the field equations, a requirement which I had abandoned only with a heavy\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 25.)\nFor the last time, I recall that Einstein and Grossmann had concluded [El7]\nthat the gravitational equations could be invariant under linear transformations\nonly and that Einstein's justification for this restriction was based on the belief\nthat the gravitational equations ought to determine the g^ uniquely, a point he\ncontinued to stress in October 1914 [E16].\u2022\u201e\u201e, $\u201e\u201e correspond to Einstein's G^, Rf,, Sf, in [E44].\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations.

Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2].\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.'

Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. All through December 1915 and January 1916, the cor-\nrespondence between Lorentz and Ehrenfest is intense and reveals much about\ntheir personalities. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. Ehrenfest, aged 35, in Leiden, ten miles down the road, is also hard at work\non relativity. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6].\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\nCommenting on the status of experimental relativity in 1979, David Wilkinson\nremarked:\n[These] two early successes [\u2014the perihelion precession and the bending of\nlight\u2014were] followed by decades of painfully slow experimental progress.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments. For a summary of the\npresent status of the experimental verification of general relativity (excluding cos-\nmology), the reader should consult the report by Irwin Shapiro wherein it will be\nfound that, within the errors, all is well with the red shift (both astronomically\nand terrestrially), with the bending of light, with the precession of the perihelia\nof Mercury and other bodies, and also with the modern refined tests of the equiv-\n*This article was published both in the Annalen der Physik and, also in 1916, as a separate booklet\n[E7] which went through numerous printings and was also translated into English [E8].\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition.

In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq.9 marks the beginning of a new chapter in general\nrelativity. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity. They also show that numerical relativity has taken great strides with\nthe help of ever-improving computers.\nEven before relativity, Lorentz had conjectured in 1900 that gravitation 'can be\nattributed to actions which do not propagate with a velocity larger than that of\nlight' [L6]. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6]. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2.*\nFinally, as a gift from the heavens, there comes to us the binary pulsar\nPSR1913 + 16, 'the first known system in which relativistic gravity can be used\nas a practical tool for the determination of astrophysical parameters' [W17].\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end. In the obituary, Einstein lauded a number of diverse contributions\nbut reserved his highest praise for Mach's historical and critical analysis of\nmechanics [M6], a work that had profoundly influenced him since his student\ndays [E27], when he was introduced to it by Besso [E28].* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30].** Einstein had Mach's discussion of rotational motion in mind\nwhen he wrote his own 1916 synopsis: its second section, entitled 'On the Grounds\nWhich Make Plausible an Extension of the [Special] Relativity Postulate,' begins\nwith the phrase:\nClassical mechanics, and the special theory of relativity not less, suffer from an\nepistemological shortcoming [the preferred position of uniform translation over\nall other types of relative motion] which was probably emphasized for the first\ntime by Mach. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein. In February 1916, Einstein gave a lecture\non the Foucault pendulum [E31]., the Einstein-Grossmann] theory' [E32]. In his later years, however,\nMach turned his back on relativity. as\nassuredly disclaim to be a forerunner of the relativists as I withhold from the\natomistic belief of the present day,' and added that to him relativity seemed 'to be\ngrowing more and more dogmatical' [M9].] was a consequence of\nan absorption capacity diminished by age, since the whole direction of thinking of\nthis theory is in concordance with that of Mach, so that it is justified to consider\nMach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity,' he wrote in 1930 [E33].\nIn a discussion of Mach's influence on Einstein, it is necessary to make a clear\ndistinction between three themes.\nFirst, Mach's emphasis on the relativity of all motion.'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27].\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle. Let us\nsee how Einstein read Mach. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable.

Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed.

Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion.

When Mie asked afterward why Einstein had not mentioned his,\nMie's, work, Einstein replied that he would discuss only theories which, unlike\nMie's, satisfy the equivalence principle.

Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.\nAll of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the\nformative stages of their development. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations.

The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl].

I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. When Miihsam once asked what would have become of Einstein if he had\nbeen born the son of poor Russian Jews, Einstein replied that he would probably\nhave become a rabbi [S6].

He went to Berlin for his university\neducation. 'As soon as it became clear to Szilard that physics was his real interest,\nhe introduced himself, with characteristic directness, to Albert Einstein.

PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.\nLanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over\na dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. In 1928,\nEinstein wrote to Erwin Madelung in Frankfurt am Main, asking if it would be\npossible for Lanczos to have a year's leave of absence from his position as an\nassistant and Privatdozent at the University of Frankfurt in order to work with\nEinstein on problems in unified field theory [E30]. A week later, Lanczos wrote\nto Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4]. He\nwrote a number of books, three of which deal with Einstein, his oeuvre, and his\ninfluence [L6, L7, L8].\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.\nAfter the departure of Lanczos and Miintz, Einstein contacted Richard von\nMises in Vienna to ask if he knew of someone interested in working with him. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration.\nMeanwhile, in October 1932, Einstein had been appointed professor at The\nInstitute for Advanced Study with the understanding that his first period in\nPrinceton would start in October 1933.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493\nham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-\nment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-\ntion. After other conditions of his professorship had been settled to mutual\nsatisfaction, Einstein wrote to Flexner, 'Now my only wish is that Herr Dr W. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University. Now, as I\nhave very great regard for Professor Mayer's abilities, not only as my collaborator\nbut also as an independent researcher in pure mathematics whose achievements\nare notable and valuable, he would be the right man to take up such a professor-\nship.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work .\nEinstein prevailed, and Mayer was given a tenured position with the title of\nassociate, the only appointment of its kind ever made by the Institute. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,\nwhen the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c). I was sure that Einstein had not\ndone the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function\ninstead. The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. At\nthat time Rosen was in the Soviet Union, where Einstein had helped him to obtain\na temporary position. The little man with the pince-nez must have replied to the good\nprofessor, for shortly afterward Einstein wrote again to Molotov to thank him for\nhis help [E56]. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein.\nThe Buckys and the Einsteins became friends after the two families moved to the\nUnited States. Leopold Infeld. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote\nabout his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. Infeld was professor at the University of Toronto from\n1938 to 1950 and at the University of Warsaw from 1950 until his death, d. A member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1935-7. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58].

Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]\non relativity theory. Ernst Gabor Straus, b. 1922, Munich. Assistant to Einstein 1944-8.

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923. Rathenau was murdered just a few\nmonths before Einstein set out for Japan, glad to absent himself for a while from\na potentially dangerous situation.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. for physics awarded to you more by letter. In Novem-\nber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein. On December 4 he received a telegram from the Prussian Academy:\n'Antwort: Einstein ist Reichsdeutscher.' On December 11 the Foreign Office\ninformed him that Einstein was Swiss. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El].\nIn March 1923 Svante Arrhenius, one of the Committee members, wrote to\nEinstein suggesting that the latter not wait until December for his visit to Sweden\nbut that he come in July. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,\nthough he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Some physicists also\nsigned: M. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien). Theoretical physics. Theoretical physics. Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). Theoretical physics. Mathematical physics. Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E.\nWien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and\nLorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein\nand Lorentz). As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507\nBefore turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions\nof the Committee to the earlier ones. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special\nand general relativity. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\n1919.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] .\n1920. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Hadamard (Paris) proposes either Einstein or Perrin. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Eddington writes, 'Einstein\nstands above his contemporaries even as Newton did' [E5]. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was. The order of awards for quantum\nphysics was perfect: first Planck, then Einstein, then Bohr. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. I mention here one\nadditional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:\n'The old one had . I leave, of course, to myself and\nto my readers all attempts to analyse what this statement reveals about Freud and\nabout Einstein. This is the first of three letters in which Einstein\nfocuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. It is significant that neither\nin 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac. Einstein is now convinced that quantum mechanics\nwill survive.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,\nProfessor E. Schroedinger from Berlin and Professor W. Heisenberg from\nLeipzig.\n[Here Einstein adds a footnote: This, however, is only my own opinion, which\nmay be wrong. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the\nEnglishman Herbert Runham Brown. 'Again this year I propose Professor E. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'\npeace prize proposals.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem. Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers. Einstein writes to Mrs de Haas-Lorentz: 'Together\nwith some local colleagues, I have proposed Otto Stern and [I. Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-\ngang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory\nconsisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of\nmodern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that\ntheory stop Albert Einstein. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. Einstein writes to Dr Alvin Johnson, president emeritus\nof The New School for Social Research in New York City. Einstein writes that he has no insight and\nunderstanding concerning modern literature.\nHe and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein had read his main book,\nThe Death of Virgil, and admired it [Bl]. Einstein proposes Friedrich Wilhelm Forster for the\npeace prize: 'It might be difficult to find people who have actually been successful\nin their efforts to secure peace. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue\nto award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -\nGeiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.\nIt has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to\nStockholm proposing A.

On February 9, 1914, he gave a farewell talk before the Physical\nSociety of Zurich, in which he noted that 'we have progressed as little in the theory\nof gravitation as the physicists of the eighteenth century when they knew only\nCoulomb's law' [E6]. It is nicely written and deals mainly with\ntopics in the special theory.'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].' Then he went on to relativity\ntheory and observed that the special theory 'is not fully satisfactory from the the-\noretical point of view because it gives a preferred position to uniform motion.'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article.\nIt is almost entirely devoted to the special theory and toward the end contains phrases nearly identical\nto the ones just quoted.\n242 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthe personality can unfold itself in the freest possible way.' Then he, too, addressed\nthe question of the preferred uniform motions in the special theory.\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity.\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. In 1914 not only did he have some wrong physical ideas\nabout causality but in addition he did not yet understand some elementary math-\nematical notions about tensors [HI]. In the course of 1915 he realized, however, that this\n'argument for the determination of the Lagrange function of the gravitational field\nwas entirely illusory, since it could easily be modified in such a way that [this\nLagrangian] .\nThe mathematical details of the October 1914 paper are of no interest for the\nunderstanding of the evolution of the general theory and will be omitted. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. Toward the\nautumn of 1915 he finally realized* that his theory up until then was seriously\nwrong in several respects.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5]. However, in the pre-spin days of 1915, any dynamic theory of ferromag-\nnetism had necessarily to be incorrect.\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned. I shall next outline the\nEdH work of 1915 and then state the interesting results obtained by Barnett at\nabout the same time [B2]. All three papers appeared\nin 1915.\n248 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof a wire.\nLet us now return to our main topic, Einstein's final formulation of his theory\nof general relativity.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. All\nthese statements taken together convince me that Einstein still believed in the 'old'\ntheory as late as July 1915, that between July and October he found objections\nto that theory, and that his final version was conceived and worked out between\nlate October and November 25. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect.\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations.12)\nhad brought him closer to general covariance. Einstein still subscribes to the demands of\nunimodular invariance and \\/g = 1 \u2022 On the basis of this 'most radical relativity\ntheory,' he presents two of his greatest discoveries [E48].\nThe first result was that his theory 'explains . The calculations of the week before remain\nunaffected:\nAny physical theory that obeys special relativity can be incorporated into the\ngeneral theory of relativity; the general theory does not provide any criterion\nfor the admissibility of that physical theory. Finally the general theory of\nrelativity is closed as a logical structure. Instead, he used these conser-\nvation laws as a constraint on the theory.*\nOn June 20, 1933, Einstein, exiled from Germany, gave a lecture at the Uni-\nversity of Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of relativity. It was\nmeant to be a theory of everything but gravitation. Suffice it to say that it was Hilbert's aim to\ngive not just a theory of gravitation but an axiomatic theory of the world.\nf Mie's ideas on gravitation were referred to in Chapter 13.\n258 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nlends an exalted quality to his paper, from the title, 'Die Grundlagen der Physik,'\nThe Foundations of Physics, to the concluding paragraph, in which he expressed\nhis conviction that his fundamental equations would eventually solve the riddles\nof atomic structure. In December 1915, Einstein remarked that Hilbert's com-\nmitment to Mie's theory was unnecessary from the point of view of general rela-\ntivity [E53]. Justified though these criticisms are, Hilbert's paper nevertheless\ncontains a very important and independent contribution to general relativity: the\nderivation of Eq. It is again entitled 'Die Grundlagen der Physik' and contains a synopsis of\nhis 1915 paper and a sequel to it [H6], written a year later.* The subject was general relativity. From\nthe period in which Einstein lectured, it is clear that his subject was the imperfect\ntheory described in his paper of October 1914. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915.\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E.** In May\n1917 he told a student from Goettingen, 'It is too great an audacity to draw\nalready now a picture of the world, since there are still so many things which we\ncannot yet remotely anticipate' [S6], an obvious reference to Hilbert's hopes for a\nunification of gravitation and electromagnetism.

The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann.) The first decade of general relativity ends with the announcement by\nEdwin Powell Hubble in December 1924 of an experimental result which settled\na debate that had been going on for well over a century: the first incontrovertible\nevidence for the existence of an extragalactic object, Messier 31, the Andromeda\nnebula [H3].f Several attempts to revert to a neo-Euclidean theory\nof gravitation and cosmology were also made in this period [N4]. A list of the principal papers on cosmology for the years 1917 to 1932 is found\nin[Rlj.\n270 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nexclusively devoted to relativity theory and gravitation. 29, 351 -546, 1957), GR2 (CNRS Report 1962),\nGR3 (Conference Internationale sur les Theories de la Gravitation, Gauthier-Villars, 1964) and\nGR7 [S3].

Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6].\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition. In another modern review, the current situation is sum-\nmarized as follows:\nSo far [general relativity] has withstood every confrontation, but new confron-\ntations, in new arenas, are on the horizon. [W8]\nWith fervent good wishes and with high hopes for further experiments with rock-\nets, satellites, and planetary probes, I hereby leave the subject of the comparison\nbetween theory and experiment in general relativity. But, as is\nnatural, in later times he tended to emphasize the simplicity of the theory rather\nthan its consequences. In 1930 he wrote, 'I do not consider the main significance\nof the general theory of relativity to be the prediction of some tiny observable\neffects, but rather the simplicity of its foundations and its consistency' [E10]. Again in 1930 he expressed the opinion that\nthe idea of general relativity 'is a purely formal point of view and not a definite\nhypothesis about nature. In 1932 he went further: 'In\nmy opinion this theory [general relativity] possesses little inner probability.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory. Energy and Momentum Conservation; the Bianchi Identities\nThe collected works of Felix Klein contain a set of papers devoted to the links\nbetween geometry on the one hand and group theory and the theory of invariants\non the other, his own Erlangen program. The last three articles of this set deal\nwith general relativity. the theory of relativity and its connection\nwith his old ideas of the Erlangen program brought the last flare-up of his math-\nematical interests and mathematical production' [W9].) One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.**\nThis time he gave a general proof (free of coordinate conditions) that for any\nmatter Lagrangian L the energy-momentum tensor T1\" satisfies\nas a consequence of the gravitational field equations.\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi.** Harward, the author of this paper, remarked, 'I discovered the general\ntheorem [Eq.

He men-\ntioned neither this hypothesis nor the problem of inertia in any of his subsequent\narticles until February 1917, when he submitted a paper [E40] which once again\nmarks the beginning of a new chapter in physics: general relativistic cosmology. again perpetrated something about gravitation\ntheory which somewhat exposes me to the danger of being confined in a madhouse'\n[E41]. It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].17 is replaced by\n \n*For details and references to cosmology in the nineteenth century, see especially [P7] and [N6].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1.

I am told that the Zeitschrift fur Physik no longer accepts\npapers on general relativity on the grounds that articles on Mach's principle pro-\nvoke too many polemical replies.

From Prague to Zurich\nGrossmann appeared in previous chapters as the helpful fellow student who made\nhis course notes available to Einstein, as the helpful friend who together with his\nfather paved the way for Einstein's appointment at the patent office in Bern, and\nas the friend to whom Einstein dedicated his doctoral thesis. Thereupon he studied at the ETH\nfrom 1896 to 1900, together with Einstein. The mentioned papers are his entire sci-\nentific output prior to the collaboration with Einstein, which began a few months\nafter the Cambridge conference.\nGrossmann had meanwhile joined the mathematics faculty at the ETH in\nZurich, first as a stand-in and then, in 1907, as a full professor of geometry.\nOne of the first acts of the uncommonly young dean was to sound out Einstein\n208\nannTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 209\nas to whether he might be interested in returning to Zurich, this time to the ETH.\nGrossmann's letter is lost but not Einstein's reply: 'I am certainly prepared in\nprinciple to accept a teaching position at your [ETH]. A\npositive outcome of Grossmann's initiative appeared to be assured. Einstein was now in great demand. Einstein also wrote to Zangger of an offer (which he declined) to lecture at\nColumbia University in New York in the fall of 1912 [E4]. The authorities quickly accepted the pro-\nposal, and on February 2 Einstein could write to Alfred Stern, 'Two days ago I\nreceived the call from the [ETH] (halleluia. And so, in the fall of 1912, Einstein began the next\nphase of his academic career. 'I declined to take anything into consideration until I had settled in Zurich,'\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, whom he had informed of the Berlin and Vienna over-\ntures [E6].\nThere was one man who at that time came close to changing Einstein's mind\nand perhaps his destiny: Lorentz. Lorentz replied\n*k.\n210 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat Einstein should accept his post in Zurich cheerfully and in good spirits [LI]. On February 29, 1912,\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, 'I was called to Leiden by Lorentz to be his successor. Some time in 1913 Einstein sent Ehrenfest a letter which must often have\ngiven its recipient food for thought: 'When Lorentz called me at that time I expe-\nrienced an undeniable shudder' [E9]. From scalar to tensor\nIn August 1912, Einstein and his family arrived back in Zurich. Some time between August 10 and August 16, it became clear to\nEinstein that Riemannian geometry is the correct mathematical tool for what we\nnow call general relativity theory.\nIn order to appreciate what happened in August 1912, it is essential to know\nthat before his arrival in Zurich Einstein had already concluded that the descrip-\ntion of gravitation in terms of the single scalar c-field of the Prague days had to\ngo and that a new geometry of physical space-time was needed. This opinion is based on some remarks in Einstein's\npapers; on a study of all the letters from the period March-August 16, 1912,\nwhich are in the Einstein archives in Princeton; and on recollections by myself\nand by Ernst Gabor Straus, Einstein's assistant from 1944 to 1948, of conversa-\ntions with Einstein. Toward the end of that month,\nEinstein wrote to Besso, 'Recently, I have been working furiously on the gravi-\ntation problem. This undated letter was\ncertainly written in 1912 and most probably before the middle of May, since by\nthat time, Einstein had become less assured.\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 211\nuntil now I have been unable to penetrate beyond the statics of gravitation' [El 3]. Since Einstein wrote congratulations to von\nLaue in June [El5], it is most probable that the letter to Zangger was written in\nthat same month.\nThere is a brief and cryptic statement in the last paper Einstein wrote in\nPrague, in July, which indicates that he was onto something new. I do not know how often such a symbol is found\nin Einstein's writings, but I do know that it occurs only rarely.\nOn August 10, as said, Einstein registered as a Zurich resident.\nTwo statements by Einstein tell the story.' One Einstein biographer wrote general for most general [S4], a nontrivial modification\nof this crucial phrase.\n212 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nat that time that Riemann had studied the foundations of geometry in an even\nmore profound way. My dear friend the math-\nematician Grossmann was there when I returned from Prague to Zurich.\nRegarding the role of Carl Friedrich Geiser,* it is known that Einstein attended\nat least some of Geiser's lectures [K2].\nI believe that this first encounter with differential geometry played a secondary\nrole in Einstein's thinking in 1912. During long conversations with Einstein in\nPrague, the mathematician Georg Pick expressed the conjecture that the needed\nmathematical instruments for the further development of Einstein's ideas might\nbe found in the papers by Ricci and Levi-Civita [Fl]. I doubt that this remark\nmade any impression on Einstein at that time.\nEinstein's second statement on the July-August period was made in 1923: 'I\nhad the decisive idea of the analogy between the mathematical problem of the\ntheory [of general relativity] and the Gaussian theory of surfaces only in 1912,\nhowever, after my return to Zurich, without being aware at that time of the work\nof Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.\nWe learn from these two statements that even during his last weeks in Prague\nEinstein already knew that he needed the theory of invariants and covariants\nassociated with the differential line element\n'Geiser was a competent and influential mathematician who did much to raise the level of the math-\nematics faculty at the ETH [Kl]. With Grossmann's help,\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 213\nthe great transition to Riemannian geometry must have taken place during the\nweek prior to August 16, as is indicated by Einstein's letter to Hopf.\nThese conclusions are in harmony with my own recollections of a discussion\nwith Einstein in which I asked him how the collaboration with Grossmann began.\nI have a vivid though not verbatim memory of Einstein's reply: he told Grossmann\nof his problems and asked him to please go to the library and see if there existed\nan appropriate geometry to handle such questions. The next day Grossmann\nreturned (Einstein told me) and said that there indeed was such a geometry, Rie-\nmannian geometry. It is quite plausible that Grossmann needed to consult the\nliterature since, as we have seen, his own field of research was removed from\ndifferential geometry.\nThere is a curiously phrased expression of thanks to Grossmann which, I\nbelieve, comes close to confirming this recollection of mine. It is found at the end\nof the introduction to Einstein's first monograph on general relativity, written in\n1916: 'Finally, grateful thoughts go at this place to my friend the mathematician\nGrossmann, who by his help not only saved me the study of the relevant mathe-\nmatical literature but also supported me in the search for the field equations of\ngravitation' [E21].\nFinally, there is a recollection which I owe to Straus [S6], who also remembers\nthat Einstein was already thinking about general covariance when he met Gross-\nmann. Einstein told Grossmann that he needed a geometry which allowed for the\nmost general transformations that leave Eq. Grossmann replied\nthat Einstein was looking for Riemannian geometry. (Straus does not recall that\nEinstein had asked Grossmann to check the literature.) But, Grossmann added,\nthat is a terrible mess which physicists should not be involved with. Einstein then\nasked if there were any other geometries he could use. Grossmann said no and\npointed out to Einstein that the differential equations of Riemannian geometry\nare nonlinear, which he considered a bad feature. Einstein replied to this last\nremark that he thought, on the contrary, that was a great advantage.* Einstein was not the greatest expert\nin following the scientific literature, but he apparently did know Born's main\npaper of 1909 on the relativistic treatment of rigid bodies [Bl]. At the Salzburg\nconference in the fall of 1909, Born's presentation of his work on the rigid body\n[B2] immediately preceded Einstein's own report on the constitution of radiation\n[E25], and it is known that the two men used that occasion for private discussions\non scientific topics of so much common concern [B3]. In June 1912 Einstein was\nbrooding over Born's earlier work, as his letter to Ehrenfest shows. For our pur-\nposes, it is of no relevance to discuss the paradoxes to which this approach gives\nrise for the case of a finite body\u2014the case to which Einstein referred in his June\n7 letter to Ehrenfest.\nI now return to Einstein.\nHowever this may be, after his first dicussions with Grossmann, Einstein had\nfound the correct starting point for general relativity. In October Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld:\nAt present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now\nbelieve that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathema-\ntician here. The collaboration\nThe Einstein-Grossmann paper (referred to here as EG), published in 1913\n[E29], contains profound physical insight into the nature of measurement, some\ncorrect general relativistic equations, some faulty reasoning, and clumsy notation. In 1914 Einstein abandoned this miserable notation. This rule was intro-\nduced in 1916\u2014by none other than Einstein himself [E31].\nIn EG, Einstein expresses his indebtedness to Mach for inspiring some of his\nideas. Comments on the influence of Mach on Einstein, an important subject in\nits own right, will be deferred till Chapter 15.THE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 217\nEotvos experiments for the first time in EG, concluding that 'the physical identity\nof gravitational and inertial mass .'*\nAfter these prefatory remarks, I turn to Grossmann's contribution to EG.\nI restrict my own task to explaining how Einstein 'grew up.\nGrossman's contribution consists of a lucid exposition of Riemannian geometry\nand its tensor calculus. In addition, he gives mathematical details in support of\nsome of Einstein's arguments.where\nFor a symmetric T\"\" we have:\na relation that Einstein used in the discussion of energy-momentum conservation. This is one of the relations that threw Einstein off the\ntrack for some time.\nGrossmann devotes a special section to antisymmetric tensors.\nGrossmann's concluding section starts as follows.' He then\npresents to Einstein the major tensor of the future theory: the 'Ghristoffel four-\nindex symbol,' now better known as the Riemann-Christoffel tensor [W7]:\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 219\nFrom this tensor 'it is .Having come this close, Grossmann next makes a mistake to which I shall return\nin the course of describing Einstein's contributions to EG, a topic which should\nbe prefaced by stating Grossmann's agreement with Einstein.\nEinstein begins by stating his desideratum: to generalize the theory of relativity\nin such a way that his earlier result on the variability of the light velocity in an\ninhomogeneous static gravitational field [E33] shall be contained as a special case.\n220 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nEinstein uses Eqs.

Apologizing to Ehrenfest for a long silence,\nEinstein wrote in May 1913, 'My excuse lies in the literally superhuman efforts\nI have devoted to the gravitational problem.\nI have now come to the end of the more complex and adventurous part of Ein-\nstein's road to the general theory of relativity.

He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44]. At that time he had given a proof of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian.

From Prague to Zurich\nGrossmann appeared in previous chapters as the helpful fellow student who made\nhis course notes available to Einstein, as the helpful friend who together with his\nfather paved the way for Einstein's appointment at the patent office in Bern, and\nas the friend to whom Einstein dedicated his doctoral thesis. Thereupon he studied at the ETH\nfrom 1896 to 1900, together with Einstein. The mentioned papers are his entire sci-\nentific output prior to the collaboration with Einstein, which began a few months\nafter the Cambridge conference.\nOne of the first acts of the uncommonly young dean was to sound out Einstein\n208\nannTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 209\nas to whether he might be interested in returning to Zurich, this time to the ETH.\nGrossmann's letter is lost but not Einstein's reply: 'I am certainly prepared in\nprinciple to accept a teaching position at your [ETH]. Einstein was now in great demand. Einstein also wrote to Zangger of an offer (which he declined) to lecture at\nColumbia University in New York in the fall of 1912 [E4]. The authorities quickly accepted the pro-\nposal, and on February 2 Einstein could write to Alfred Stern, 'Two days ago I\nreceived the call from the [ETH] (halleluia. And so, in the fall of 1912, Einstein began the next\nphase of his academic career. 'I declined to take anything into consideration until I had settled in Zurich,'\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, whom he had informed of the Berlin and Vienna over-\ntures [E6].\nThere was one man who at that time came close to changing Einstein's mind\nand perhaps his destiny: Lorentz.\n210 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat Einstein should accept his post in Zurich cheerfully and in good spirits [LI]. On February 29, 1912,\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, 'I was called to Leiden by Lorentz to be his successor. Some time in 1913 Einstein sent Ehrenfest a letter which must often have\ngiven its recipient food for thought: 'When Lorentz called me at that time I expe-\nrienced an undeniable shudder' [E9]. From scalar to tensor\nIn August 1912, Einstein and his family arrived back in Zurich.\nIn order to appreciate what happened in August 1912, it is essential to know\nthat before his arrival in Zurich Einstein had already concluded that the descrip-\ntion of gravitation in terms of the single scalar c-field of the Prague days had to\ngo and that a new geometry of physical space-time was needed. This opinion is based on some remarks in Einstein's\npapers; on a study of all the letters from the period March-August 16, 1912,\nwhich are in the Einstein archives in Princeton; and on recollections by myself\nand by Ernst Gabor Straus, Einstein's assistant from 1944 to 1948, of conversa-\ntions with Einstein.\nTo begin with, let us recall that the second of the 1912 papers discussed in the\nprevious chapter [E10] was completed in March. Toward the end of that month,\nEinstein wrote to Besso, 'Recently, I have been working furiously on the gravi-\ntation problem. This undated letter was\ncertainly written in 1912 and most probably before the middle of May, since by\nthat time, Einstein had become less assured. Since Einstein wrote congratulations to von\nLaue in June [El5], it is most probable that the letter to Zangger was written in\nthat same month. It is my understanding that Einstein was sure he\nwas moving in the right direction but that he gradually came to the conviction that\nsome essential theoretical tools were lacking.\nThere is a brief and cryptic statement in the last paper Einstein wrote in\nPrague, in July, which indicates that he was onto something new. I do not know how often such a symbol is found\nin Einstein's writings, but I do know that it occurs only rarely.\nOn August 10, as said, Einstein registered as a Zurich resident.*\nWhat happened in July and early August 1912.\nTwo statements by Einstein tell the story.' One Einstein biographer wrote general for most general [S4], a nontrivial modification\nof this crucial phrase.\nRegarding the role of Carl Friedrich Geiser,* it is known that Einstein attended\nat least some of Geiser's lectures [K2].\nI believe that this first encounter with differential geometry played a secondary\nrole in Einstein's thinking in 1912. During long conversations with Einstein in\nPrague, the mathematician Georg Pick expressed the conjecture that the needed\nmathematical instruments for the further development of Einstein's ideas might\nbe found in the papers by Ricci and Levi-Civita [Fl]. I doubt that this remark\nmade any impression on Einstein at that time.\nEinstein's second statement on the July-August period was made in 1923: 'I\nhad the decisive idea of the analogy between the mathematical problem of the\ntheory [of general relativity] and the Gaussian theory of surfaces only in 1912,\nhowever, after my return to Zurich, without being aware at that time of the work\nof Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.\nWe learn from these two statements that even during his last weeks in Prague\nEinstein already knew that he needed the theory of invariants and covariants\nassociated with the differential line element\n'Geiser was a competent and influential mathematician who did much to raise the level of the math-\nematics faculty at the ETH [Kl].\nThese conclusions are in harmony with my own recollections of a discussion\nwith Einstein in which I asked him how the collaboration with Grossmann began.\nI have a vivid though not verbatim memory of Einstein's reply: he told Grossmann\nof his problems and asked him to please go to the library and see if there existed\nan appropriate geometry to handle such questions. It is found at the end\nof the introduction to Einstein's first monograph on general relativity, written in\n1916: 'Finally, grateful thoughts go at this place to my friend the mathematician\nGrossmann, who by his help not only saved me the study of the relevant mathe-\nmatical literature but also supported me in the search for the field equations of\ngravitation' [E21]. (Straus does not recall that\nEinstein had asked Grossmann to check the literature. Einstein then\nasked if there were any other geometries he could use. Einstein replied to this last\nremark that he thought, on the contrary, that was a great advantage. [E22]\nLet us pursue Einstein's 'decisive step' a little further.* Einstein was not the greatest expert\nin following the scientific literature, but he apparently did know Born's main\npaper of 1909 on the relativistic treatment of rigid bodies [Bl]. At the Salzburg\nconference in the fall of 1909, Born's presentation of his work on the rigid body\n[B2] immediately preceded Einstein's own report on the constitution of radiation\n[E25], and it is known that the two men used that occasion for private discussions\non scientific topics of so much common concern [B3]. In June 1912 Einstein was\nbrooding over Born's earlier work, as his letter to Ehrenfest shows. For our pur-\nposes, it is of no relevance to discuss the paradoxes to which this approach gives\nrise for the case of a finite body\u2014the case to which Einstein referred in his June\n7 letter to Ehrenfest.\nI now return to Einstein.\nHowever this may be, after his first dicussions with Grossmann, Einstein had\nfound the correct starting point for general relativity. In October Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld:\nAt present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now\nbelieve that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathema-\ntician here. The collaboration\nThe Einstein-Grossmann paper (referred to here as EG), published in 1913\n[E29], contains profound physical insight into the nature of measurement, some\ncorrect general relativistic equations, some faulty reasoning, and clumsy notation. In 1914 Einstein abandoned this miserable notation. This rule was intro-\nduced in 1916\u2014by none other than Einstein himself [E31].\nIn EG, Einstein expresses his indebtedness to Mach for inspiring some of his\nideas. Comments on the influence of Mach on Einstein, an important subject in\nits own right, will be deferred till Chapter 15.\nAs we have seen, the equivalence principle in its primitive form (equality of\ngravitational and inertial mass for a material object) was Einstein's guide ever\nsince 1907. 'Ein-\nstein grew up in the Christoffel-Ricci tradition,' Christian Felix Klein wrote in\nhis history of mathematics in the nineteenth century [K3].\nI restrict my own task to explaining how Einstein 'grew up. In addition, he gives mathematical details in support of\nsome of Einstein's arguments.where\nFor a symmetric T\"\" we have:\na relation that Einstein used in the discussion of energy-momentum conservation. This is one of the relations that threw Einstein off the\ntrack for some time.' He then\npresents to Einstein the major tensor of the future theory: the 'Ghristoffel four-\nindex symbol,' now better known as the Riemann-Christoffel tensor [W7]:\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 219\nFrom this tensor 'it is .Having come this close, Grossmann next makes a mistake to which I shall return\nin the course of describing Einstein's contributions to EG, a topic which should\nbe prefaced by stating Grossmann's agreement with Einstein.\nEinstein begins by stating his desideratum: to generalize the theory of relativity\nin such a way that his earlier result on the variability of the light velocity in an\ninhomogeneous static gravitational field [E33] shall be contained as a special case.\n220 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nEinstein uses Eqs. The Stumbling Block\nClearly, Einstein and Grossmann were in quest of a tensor .\nThe first one, found in Einstein's part, can be phrased as follows.\nEinstein's 'physical argument' is irrelevant.31)\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 223\nEinstein did not at once perceive the apparent restrictions on general covariance\nas a flaw. Apologizing to Ehrenfest for a long silence,\nEinstein wrote in May 1913, 'My excuse lies in the literally superhuman efforts\nI have devoted to the gravitational problem.\nI have now come to the end of the more complex and adventurous part of Ein-\nstein's road to the general theory of relativity. The Aftermath\nIn 1905 Einstein had dedicated his doctoral thesis to Grossmann. The brief remainder of this chapter is devoted to the tale of Ein-\nstein and Grossmann from the times following their epochal collaboration until\nshortly before Einstein's death.\n224 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nOn September 9, 1913, first Einstein then Grossmann read papers before the\nannual meeting of the Swiss Physical Society [E36, G2]. Einstein had already\nmoved to Berlin when their next and last joint paper came out [E37]. The paper originated as a reac-\ntion to what Grossmann was told by a friend about a lecture by Einstein on unified\nfield theory. Its contents were\ndiscussed in a correspondence between Einstein and Grossmann that is friendly\nyet strained. Einstein also wrote to Cartan, urging him not to answer Grossmann\npublicly [E38]; Cartan agreed [C2].*\nAfter Grossmann's death in 1936, Einstein wrote a moving and deeply respect-\nful letter to his widow [E39] about Grossmann's 'gruesome fate after early years\nrich in work and aspiration.'**\n* These two letters are contained in the published Cartan-Einstein correspondence [C3].\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 225\nI have a sense of regret that Einstein did not do something for which he had\noften demonstrated a talent and sensitivity: to write an obituary shortly after\nGrossmann's death.'

Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.\nAll of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the\nformative stages of their development. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. Laub published on special relativity as early as 1907\n[LI]. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2].* In 1910, Laub wrote the first major\nreview article on the experimental basis of special relativity [L3]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909. 1876, and Franz Paul,\nb.\nAs the result of a note on voltage fluctations in a condenser, 'a phenomenon\nsimilar to Brownian motion' [E3], that Einstein wrote in 1907, he became inter-\nested in the possibility of amplifying small voltage differences.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 485\nstein was quite excited about his invention, and at one time must have even con-\nsidered patenting it.

The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-\neral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21]. In 1929 he wrote to Einstein from Minsk that some of his lectures were\ngiven in Russian, others in Yiddish [Gl]. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists. 1876, Berlin.

Mrs\nMiihsam wrote to Seelig after her husband's death, 'Do you know that Einstein\nonce said to me, \"First comes your husband, then for a long while comes nothing,\nand only then come all other people\". I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. It was to\nMiihsam that Einstein told the story of having, at age twelve, composed songs in\nhonor of God which he would sing to himself on his way to school [S5] (see Chap-\nter 3). When Miihsam once asked what would have become of Einstein if he had\nbeen born the son of poor Russian Jews, Einstein replied that he would probably\nhave become a rabbi [S6].

A letter from\nEinstein in 1942 still shows personal touches: 'I have become a lonely old chap\nwho is mainly known because he does not wear socks and who is exhibited as a\ncuriosum on special occasions' [E27]. In that same letter, he also writes about his\nwork: 'In regard to work, I am more fanatic than ever and really hope to have\nsolved my old problem of the unity of the physical field. 'As soon as it became clear to Szilard that physics was his real interest,\nhe introduced himself, with characteristic directness, to Albert Einstein. I believe\nit was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-\nics. PhD in Berlin in 1922\nwith von Laue.\nEinstein and Szilard made a considerable number of joint patent applications,\neight German (November 1927-December 1930), six British (December 1927-\nDecember 1929), one U. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent\noffice in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928). In 1927 Einstein autho-\nrized Szilard to apply in his own name for patents abroad of some of their joint\nventures [E28]. Later, Szilard\nsuggested that Einstein write a second letter to the president, urging him to speed\nup these activities. Rudolf Goldschmidt.\n**I am grateful to Professor Goldschmidt's daugther-in-law Rose Goldie from New Maiden, Surrey,\nEngland, and to Horst Melcher from Potsdam for information which was of great help to me in the\npreparation of this note on the Einstein-Goldschmidt patent.

An acquaintance of Einstein, a\ndistinguished singer, had become hard of hearing. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-\nschmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. Einstein's\naddress is given as 'Earlier in Berlin, present residence unknown.'\nGoldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-\nrespondence with Einstein, d. PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.\nLanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over\na dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. In 1928,\nEinstein wrote to Erwin Madelung in Frankfurt am Main, asking if it would be\npossible for Lanczos to have a year's leave of absence from his position as an\nassistant and Privatdozent at the University of Frankfurt in order to work with\nEinstein on problems in unified field theory [E30]. A week later, Lanczos wrote\nto Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4].\nEinstein refers to Lanczos' work in one of his articles on distant parallelism [E31],\na subject on which Lanczos wrote a review two years later [L5]. He\nwrote a number of books, three of which deal with Einstein, his oeuvre, and his\ninfluence [L6, L7, L8].\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.* Einstein acknowledged Miintz's work in two papers on distant\nparallelism [E31, E33].\nAfter the departure of Lanczos and Miintz, Einstein contacted Richard von\nMises in Vienna to ask if he knew of someone interested in working with him. The Einstein-Mayer\ncollaboration started soon after and was at once a success. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35]. In October\nEinstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which\na new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-\ntime continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point\n[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. It deals with semi-vectors and spinors\n[E38] and was the last paper published by Einstein in the Sitzungsberichte of the\nPreussische Akademie.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493\nham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-\nment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-\ntion. After other conditions of his professorship had been settled to mutual\nsatisfaction, Einstein wrote to Flexner, 'Now my only wish is that Herr Dr W. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work . The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. During Einstein's second visit to California,\nhe published a joint note with de Sitter [E48] in which a cosmologically flat uni-\nverse is proposed (without cosmological term and with zero pressure), d. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,\nwhen the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c). I was sure that Einstein had not\ndone the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function\ninstead. The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen. In\n1936 they published a note on the general relativistic two-body problem [E51] and\nin 1937 a paper on cylindrical gravitational waves [E52].\nIn the course of working on this last problem, Einstein believed for some time\nthat he had shown that the rigorous relativistic field equations do not allow for the\nexistence of gravitational waves [II, S2].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein was enraged and wrote to the editor that he objected to\nhis paper being shown to colleagues prior to publication [E53]. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. At\nthat time Rosen was in the Soviet Union, where Einstein had helped him to obtain\na temporary position. The little man with the pince-nez must have replied to the good\nprofessor, for shortly afterward Einstein wrote again to Molotov to thank him for\nhis help [E56]. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote\nabout his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. In 1929 Hoffmann\nstarted work on projective relativity with Veblen. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3].

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. In Novem-\nber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein.' On December 11 the Foreign Office\ninformed him that Einstein was Swiss. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. On March 24 Einstein wrote to the Prussian Academy\nthat he had made no change in citizenship status as a condition for his position in\nBerlin. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El].\nIn March 1923 Svante Arrhenius, one of the Committee members, wrote to\nEinstein suggesting that the latter not wait until December for his visit to Sweden\nbut that he come in July. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,\nthough he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Some physicists also\nsigned: M. In its Report,\nthe Committee noted that neither Poincare's brilliant mathematical contributions\nnor his mathematical-philosophical essays (especially mentioned by many nomi-\nnators) could be designated discoveries or inventions within physics 'unless one\ngives these concepts an especially broad interpretation. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien).)\n1913. Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). In all three instances, his sole motivation was relativity (until further\nnotice, relativity shall refer to the special theory). In 1910 he wrote that relativity\nwas the most far-reaching new concept since the discovery of the energy principle\n[Ol]. On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E.\nWien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and\nLorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein\nand Lorentz). As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507\nBefore turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions\nof the Committee to the earlier ones. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. 'Lorentz was\nundoubtedly more cautious with his hypotheses than Einstein,' it is noted. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. Einstein was deeply\nimmersed in the struggle with general relativity and was confusing everybody,\nincluding himself, with his hybrid theory in which everything was covariant\nexcept the gravitational field equations. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special\nand general relativity. Haas proposed\nEinstein for the new theory of gravitation, quoting the explanation of the peri-\nhelion precession of Mercury. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\n1919.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. However, it is noted, Einstein's statistical papers are not\nof as high a caliber as his work on relativity and quantum physics. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] .\n1920. Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein. As early as 1917 Einstein had pointed out that Gehrcke's\ntheory is based on contradictory assumptions [E4].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Hadamard (Paris) proposes either Einstein or Perrin. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Eddington writes, 'Einstein\nstands above his contemporaries even as Newton did' [E5].' Also beside\nthe mark is his finding about the general theory: 'As Gullstrand has shown, the\nsituation is that it remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein\ntheory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion experiment [. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nOseen, the theoretical physicist, gives an excellent analysis of Einstein's paper\nof 1905 on the light-quantum as well as of his work in 1909 on energy fluctuations\nin blackbody radiation.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson.\n'Gullstrand had never published on relativity before that time. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 511\nA further exchange between Gullstrand and Kretschmann settled their differ-\nences to mutual satisfaction [K3].\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was. Einstein's paper\non that subject was the first application of quantum theory to systems other than\npure radiation. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

In September 1918 Einstein received a request from Stockholm\nfor a nomination in physics for the year 1919. January 19, 1921. In response to another request for a nomination in phys-\nics, Einstein writes that he finds it difficult to make one definite proposal.\n**The references given in [PI] and [P2] occur explicitly in Einstein's letters. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies\nto Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-\nnot decide to intervene in the present case.'\nUpon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a\nletter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-\ninitely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals. Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. I mention here one\nadditional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:\n'The old one had . I leave, of course, to myself and\nto my readers all attempts to analyse what this statement reveals about Freud and\nabout Einstein. This is the first of three letters in which Einstein\nfocuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. It is significant that neither\nin 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac. Einstein is now convinced that quantum mechanics\nwill survive.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,\nProfessor E. Schroedinger from Berlin and Professor W. Heisenberg from\nLeipzig.\n[Here Einstein adds a footnote: This, however, is only my own opinion, which\nmay be wrong.'\nEinstein's judgment of the relative scientific merits of Schroedinger's and Hei-\nsenberg's work was indeed wrong. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the\nEnglishman Herbert Runham Brown. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'\npeace prize proposals.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem. Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers. Einstein writes to Mrs de Haas-Lorentz: 'Together\nwith some local colleagues, I have proposed Otto Stern and [I. Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-\ngang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory\nconsisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of\nmodern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that\ntheory stop Albert Einstein. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. In 1947 Einstein wrote to Stalin, 'As an old Jew, I appeal\nto you to find and send back to his country Raoul Wallenberg . Einstein writes to Dr Alvin Johnson, president emeritus\nof The New School for Social Research in New York City. Einstein writes that he has no insight and\nunderstanding concerning modern literature.\nHe and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein had read his main book,\nThe Death of Virgil, and admired it [Bl]. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue\nto award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -\nGeiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.\nIt has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to\nStockholm proposing A.

With Grossmann's help,\nTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 213\nthe great transition to Riemannian geometry must have taken place during the\nweek prior to August 16, as is indicated by Einstein's letter to Hopf.\nI have a vivid though not verbatim memory of Einstein's reply: he told Grossmann\nof his problems and asked him to please go to the library and see if there existed\nan appropriate geometry to handle such questions. The next day Grossmann\nreturned (Einstein told me) and said that there indeed was such a geometry, Rie-\nmannian geometry. It is quite plausible that Grossmann needed to consult the\nliterature since, as we have seen, his own field of research was removed from\ndifferential geometry. Einstein told Grossmann that he needed a geometry which allowed for the\nmost general transformations that leave Eq. Grossmann replied\nthat Einstein was looking for Riemannian geometry. Even then he excluded the coordinate\ndifferentials dx* from this rule. I would further\nrecommend the essays by Dirk Struik on the history of differential geometry [S7].

From Prague to Zurich\nGrossmann appeared in previous chapters as the helpful fellow student who made\nhis course notes available to Einstein, as the helpful friend who together with his\nfather paved the way for Einstein's appointment at the patent office in Bern, and\nas the friend to whom Einstein dedicated his doctoral thesis.\nGrossmann, a descendant of an old Swiss family, was born in 1878 in Budapest,\nwhere his father was employed. Thereupon he studied at the ETH\nfrom 1896 to 1900, together with Einstein. In 1910\nhe became one of the founders of the Swiss Mathematical Society.\nOne of the first acts of the uncommonly young dean was to sound out Einstein\n208\nannTHE EINSTEIN-GROSSMANN COLLABORATION 209\nas to whether he might be interested in returning to Zurich, this time to the ETH. I am extraordinarily happy\nabout the prospect of returning to Zurich. Zurich was where he wanted to be. Berlin was beckoning even before he\narrived in Zurich. The formalities concerning the Zurich appointment had been completed by\nthen. 'I declined to take anything into consideration until I had settled in Zurich,'\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, whom he had informed of the Berlin and Vienna over-\ntures [E6]. During the Solvay conference in October 1911,\nLorentz asked Einstein what the prospects were of his coming to Utrecht [LI].\nPerhaps it was not clear to Einstein whether Lorentz would actually have liked\nto see a foreigner occupy the chair in Utrecht.\n210 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat Einstein should accept his post in Zurich cheerfully and in good spirits [LI]. On February 29, 1912,\nEinstein wrote to Zangger, 'I was called to Leiden by Lorentz to be his successor.\nIt was good that I was already committed to Zurich, for, if not, I would have had\nto go there' [E8]. From scalar to tensor\nIn August 1912, Einstein and his family arrived back in Zurich.\nIn order to appreciate what happened in August 1912, it is essential to know\nthat before his arrival in Zurich Einstein had already concluded that the descrip-\ntion of gravitation in terms of the single scalar c-field of the Prague days had to\ngo and that a new geometry of physical space-time was needed. I am convinced\nthat he arrived in Zurich with the knowledge that not just one but ten gravitational\npotentials were needed. This opinion is based on some remarks in Einstein's\npapers; on a study of all the letters from the period March-August 16, 1912,\nwhich are in the Einstein archives in Princeton; and on recollections by myself\nand by Ernst Gabor Straus, Einstein's assistant from 1944 to 1948, of conversa-\ntions with Einstein.\nThere is a brief and cryptic statement in the last paper Einstein wrote in\nPrague, in July, which indicates that he was onto something new.\nOn August 10, as said, Einstein registered as a Zurich resident. My dear friend the math-\nematician Grossmann was there when I returned from Prague to Zurich.\nRegarding the role of Carl Friedrich Geiser,* it is known that Einstein attended\nat least some of Geiser's lectures [K2].\nEinstein's second statement on the July-August period was made in 1923: 'I\nhad the decisive idea of the analogy between the mathematical problem of the\ntheory [of general relativity] and the Gaussian theory of surfaces only in 1912,\nhowever, after my return to Zurich, without being aware at that time of the work\nof Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.\nWe learn from these two statements that even during his last weeks in Prague\nEinstein already knew that he needed the theory of invariants and covariants\nassociated with the differential line element\n'Geiser was a competent and influential mathematician who did much to raise the level of the math-\nematics faculty at the ETH [Kl]. Einstein then\nasked if there were any other geometries he could use. At the Salzburg\nconference in the fall of 1909, Born's presentation of his work on the rigid body\n[B2] immediately preceded Einstein's own report on the constitution of radiation\n[E25], and it is known that the two men used that occasion for private discussions\non scientific topics of so much common concern [B3].\nI now return to Einstein.Having come this close, Grossmann next makes a mistake to which I shall return\nin the course of describing Einstein's contributions to EG, a topic which should\nbe prefaced by stating Grossmann's agreement with Einstein.\n224 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nOn September 9, 1913, first Einstein then Grossmann read papers before the\nannual meeting of the Swiss Physical Society [E36, G2]. Einstein had already\nmoved to Berlin when their next and last joint paper came out [E37].

Let us\nbriefly recapitulate the developments in his thinking about gravitation up to the\nspring of 1913. Late in 1907 he discovered the singular position of gravitation in\nthe theory of relativity. He realized that the question was not how to incorporate\ngravitation into the special theory but rather how to use gravitation as a means of\nbreaking away from the privileged position of covariance for uniform relative\nmotion to covariance for general motion. In his Prague days, the analysis of the\nmotion of light in an inhomogeneous gravitational field taught him that the light\nvelocity depends on the gravitational potential and that therefore the framework\nof the special theory of relativity was too narrow [E2]. Toward the end of his stay\nin Prague, the technical concept of general covariance took shape in his mind and\nthe fundamental role of the metric tensor as the carrier of gravitation became clear.\nThe first steps toward the tensor theory of gravitation, taken with Grossmann, led\nhim to conclude that the gravitational field equations can be covariant only with\nrespect to linear transformations. The gravitational equations unfortunately do not have\nthe property of general covariance. However, the whole faith in the theory rests on the conviction\nthat acceleration of the reference system is equivalent to a gravitational field.* He was going to report not only on his own work but also\n*At that meeting, Einstein met and complimented Friedrich Kottler, who had been the first to write\nthe Maxwell equations in generally covariant form, though not in connection with a theory of grav-\nitation [Kl].\n228\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 229\non the gravitation theory which the Finnish physicist Gunnar Nordstrom had\nbeen developing since 1912. Furthermore, he was going to comment on yet another\nrecent gravitation theory, this one by Abraham (whom we encountered earlier in\nthe discussion of special relativity). He would also be confronted, he knew, with\nstill a further theory of gravity of recent vintage, one by Gustav Mie.* In one way\nor another, this outpouring of gravitation theories in the years 1912 and 1913 was\na consequence of Einstein's Prague papers. Abraham had proposed to extend Ein-\nstein's theory of variable light velocity in a static gravitational field to the nonstatic\ncase. These activities during 1911-13\ndo not by any means mark the beginnings of the search for a field theory of grav-\nitation, however.\nThe search began with Maxwell's remarks on a vector theory of gravitation.\nThese are found tucked away in his great memoir, A Dynamical Theory of the\nElectromagnetic Field, completed in 1864, the purpose of which is 'to explain the\n[electromagnetic] action between distant bodies without assuming the existence of\nforces capable of acting directly at sensible distances. After devoting\nsome forty printed pages to this problem, Maxwell abruptly and briefly turns to\ngravitation: 'After tracing to the action of the surrounding medium both the mag-\nnetic and the electric attractions and repulsions, and finding them to depend on\nthe inverse square of the distance, we are naturally led to inquire whether the\nattraction of gravitation, which follows the same law of the distance, is not also\ntraceable to the action of a surrounding medium. He notes that this requires an ad hoc\nchange of sign when going from the electromagnetic to the gravitational pon-\nderomotive force (recall: this is a vector theory). Therefore the gravitational energy\nalso needs an additional minus sign. As I am unable to understand in what\nway a medium can possess such properties, I cannot go any further in this direc-\ntion in searching for the cause of gravitation. Oliver Heaviside discussed the gravitational-electromagnetic analogy\nwithout mentioning the negative energy difficulty [HI]. Then if one has, for example, two\n'References to other work on gravitation from that period are found in a review by Abraham [Al]\n230 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nneutral particles at rest, each composed of a pair of subunits (+e, \u2014 e), there is\na residual Newtonian attraction between them. Nowhere in this strange paper is it noted that there exists a doubling\nof conservation laws, one for charge and one for gravitational rest mass. In 1908 Poincare mentioned\nLorentz's gravitation theory as an example of a field theory that is compatible\nwith the requirements of special relativity [PI].*\nAs late as 1912, it was still necessary to show that all these vector theories made\nno sense because of Maxwell's negative energy difficulty. At that time Abraham\npointed out that the equilibrium of a gravitational oscillator is unstable [A2]: the\namplitude of the slightest oscillation increases with emission of gravitational field\nenergy; there is radiation enhancement rather than radiation damping. Thus the\nvector theories were buried at just about the time attention shifted to scalar\ntheories.\nThis brief period began with Einstein's paper of June 1911, in which he\nshowed that the velocity of light cannot generally be treated as a universal constant\nin a static gravitational field [E4]. He generalized the Newtonian equation for a point particle, K \u2014\n\u2014 V<p = a, where K is the gravitational force acting on a unit of mass, <p the\npotential, and a the acceleration, to\nwhere \u00ab,, is the four-velocity and the dot denotes differentiation with respect to\nthe proper time r.3,\n* Poincare had already emphasized the need for a relativistic theory of gravitation in his memoir of\n1905 [ P2], in which he discussed some general kinematic aspects of the problem without commitment\nto a specific model.\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 231\nsince c is not a constant. Hence\nor, approximately,\nwhich is Einstein's equation of 1911 (see Eq. to incorporate gravity. In a later paper [A6], he\nunveiled his 'second theory': 'I would prefer to develop the new theory of gravi-\ntation without entering into [a discussion of] the space-time problem. He\nexpressed his own views about the difficult and as yet unsolved problem of gravity\nby making a comparison: 'In my opinion, the situation [regarding gravity] does\nnot indicate the failure of the [special] relativity principle, just as the discovery\nand correct interpretation of Brownian motion did not lead one to consider ther-\nmodynamics and hydrodynamics as heresies.\n232 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nthat the public debate was closed as far as he was concerned [E7]. Einstein considered him to have the\nbest understanding of gravitation among his colleagues [E9]. Abraham's 1914\nreview of gravitation theories is excellent [Al]. Since both Einstein and Abraham experienced\nso much trouble from the ^-dependence of c, why not try to find a theory of\ngravitation in which c is independent of $ and remains a universal constant in the\nfamiliar way. As I have noted repeatedly, Einstein correctly saw from the begin-\nning that the incorporation of gravity meant the end of the unconditional validity\nof special relativity.1 (which referred to unit mass) as follows:\nThe novelty of his theory lies in the m term.\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 233\nwhence\nNote further that Eqs.\nI shall leave aside further details of this theory, which left much to be desired, and\nturn at once to his 'second theory', which he proposed in 1913 [N3].

'In the context [of a theory of gravitation], the Eot-\nvos experiment plays a role similar to that of the Michelson experiment for uni-\nform motion.* The bulk of Einstein's report was of\ncourse devoted to his recent work with Grossmann.\nShortly after this meeting, Mie wrote a further critique on Einstein's theory [M4],\nto which Einstein replied by giving arguments that were in part incorrect: once\nagain he stressed the inevitability of the invariance of the gravitational equations\nfor linear transformations only [El 3].\nIn summary, prior to 1912 no attempt to construct a field theory of gravitation\nhad led anywhere. Nordstrom's was the only consistent theory of gravitation.\nThere is no evidence that anyone shared Einstein's views concerning the limita-\ntions imposed by gravitation on special relativity, nor that anyone was ready to\nfollow his program for a tensor theory of gravitation.-\nGrossmann] with favor,' Einstein wrote in the same letter in which he had\nexpressed his own doubts about the status of his theory [E3].\nfSee Chapter 14 for comments by Einstein in 1914 on the Nordstrom theory and [E17] for his\nreminiscences on scalar theories.\n236 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe portrait of Einstein the scientist in 1913 is altogether remarkable. It led to one brief paper\nwhich is of considerable interest for the history of general relativity because it\ncontains Einstein's first treatment of a gravitation theory in which general covar-\niance is strictly obeyed [El8]. Yet the theory is, of course, more general than special\nrelativity.\nThe paper concludes with the following remark: 'It is plausible that the role\nwhich the Riemann-Christoffel tensor plays in the present investigation would\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 237\nalso open a way for a derivation of the Einstein-Grossmann gravitation equations\nin a way independent of physical assumptions.\nThus, early in 1914, just fifty years after Maxwell's first attempt at a gravita-\ntion field theory, Einstein was not yet quite there but he was closing in, as the\nfinal remark of the Einstein-Fokker paper clearly indicates.

It led to one brief paper\nwhich is of considerable interest for the history of general relativity because it\ncontains Einstein's first treatment of a gravitation theory in which general covar-\niance is strictly obeyed [El8].13:\nfrom which they conclude that the Nordstrom theory is a special case of the Ein-\nstein-Grossmann theory, characterized by the additional requirement that the\nvelocity of light be constant.\nThe paper concludes with the following remark: 'It is plausible that the role\nwhich the Riemann-Christoffel tensor plays in the present investigation would\nFIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITATION: THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS 237\nalso open a way for a derivation of the Einstein-Grossmann gravitation equations\nin a way independent of physical assumptions.' A final\nfootnote states that one of the reasons given by Einstein and Grossmann [El] for\nthe nonexistence of such a connection was incorrect, namely, the allegedly wrong\nweak-field properties of the Ricci tensor (Chapter 12).\nThus, early in 1914, just fifty years after Maxwell's first attempt at a gravita-\ntion field theory, Einstein was not yet quite there but he was closing in, as the\nfinal remark of the Einstein-Fokker paper clearly indicates.

'Planck had asked him what he was working on,\nand Einstein described general relativity as it was then.\nEinstein reacted rapidly and positively to the approach from Berlin.\nEncouraged by Einstein's response, Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg\njoined in signing a formal laudatio, the statement supporting a proposal for mem-\nbership, which was presented to the academy on June 12, 1913 [Kl]. A number of arrangements remained to be worked out,\nbut already in July 1913 Einstein wrote to a friend that he was going to be in\nBerlin by the spring of 1914 [E2].\nIn a letter [K3] sent to the academy on December 7, 1913, Einstein formally\naccepted membership and declared that he wished to begin his new position in\nApril 1914. On February 9, 1914, he gave a farewell talk before the Physical\nSociety of Zurich, in which he noted that 'we have progressed as little in the theory\nof gravitation as the physicists of the eighteenth century when they knew only\nCoulomb's law' [E6].\nThe Einsteins left Zurich in late March 1914. Soon after Mileva's arrival, the Einsteins separated. Einstein saw them off at the station. In later\ntimes, after Einstein's remarriage, the sons would visit and stay with their father\nin Berlin.\nSoon after the separation, Einstein moved into a bachelor apartment at Wit-\ntelsbacherstrasse 13.\nBy the time Einstein arrived in Berlin, he was already a man of great renown,\nthough not yet the stellar figure he was to become five years later. Einstein accepted. On April 26,\n1914, his first newspaper article appeared, entitled 'Vom Relativitatsprinzip,'\nAbout the relativity principle [E10].' Einstein remarked that the\nsecond alternative appeared to him to be the correct one but added that 'on this\npoint, the views even of those physicists who understand relativity theory are still\ndivided.'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article. 'In my opin-\nion, one could just as well take the opposite view [of Einstein's] and look upon the\npreferred position of uniform motion as precisely a very important and valuable\ncharacteristic of the theory'.' Planck ended by expressing the hope that the expedition planned to\nobserve the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, would provide information about the\nbending of light predicted (not yet correctly) by Einstein.\nThis intense scientific activity did not banish from Einstein's mind a genuine\nand intense concern for the tragic events unfolding in the world around him. On\nthe contrary, the period of 1914-18 marks the public emergence of Einstein the\nradical pacifist, the man of strong moral convictions who would never shy away\nfrom expressing his opinions publicly, whether they were popular or not. This appears to be the first political\ndocument to which Einstein lent his name.* It gave him joy to find colleagues\nwho 'stand above the situation and do not let themselves be driven by the murky\n* Einstein on Peace by Otto Nathan and Heinz Norden describes in detail Einstein's political activ-\nities during the First World War [Nl].\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity. We are in the fall of 1914, at which time Einstein wrote a long\npaper for the proceedings of the Prussian Academy [El6].\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. Now, late in 1914, Einstein reproduced this same argument in his\nlong paper.\nThe mathematical details of the October 1914 paper are of no interest for the\nunderstanding of the evolution of the general theory and will be omitted. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. Einstein was grateful for hav-\ning these brought to his attention.\nIn summary, toward the end of 1914 Einstein could look back on a year which\nhad brought major changes to his personal life and his professional career.\n\"The slight extension of the set of allowed transformations given in the second Einstein-Grossmann\npaper [E23] (Section 12d) must have been found shortly afterward. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. It would be fulfilled before the year was out, but not until Einstein\nhad passed through a crisis followed by an exhausting struggle.\nMeanwhile, early in 1915 he did not publish anything substantially new on\nrelativity.** He did write two review articles, one on relativity theory [Ell] and\none on the atomic theory of matter [E29], and a short paper on the statistical\nproperties of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium [E30]. At that time Einstein made good\nuse of a temporary guest appointment at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsan-\nstalt in Charlottenburg [K4].\nWander Johannes de Haas was a Dutch physicist of Einstein's age.f In\nAugust 1913, when Lorentz sent congratulations to Einstein on his forthcoming\nappointment in Berlin, he must have added (the letter is lost) a query concerning\nde Haas, as is seen from Einstein's reply: 'At present, I do not know what to do\nin the matter of your son-in-law, since in Berlin I will have neither an institute\nnor an assistant.\nEinstein was now in a position to do something for de Haas\u2014and for Lorentz.^\nI do not know when de Haas joined Einstein at the Reichsanstalt.\nSoon after the conclusion of their collaboration, Einstein wrote enthusiastically\nabout the results obtained.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5].\nHOn one occasion, Einstein referred in print to de Haas as Herr de Haas-Lorentz [E32].\nCharacteristically, Einstein was unaware of earlier efforts to measure gyro-\nmagnetic effects until some time after his own work had been completed [E33].\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned.ff The\ntheoretical derivation by Einstein in 1915 had already been given in 1907 by\nOwen Willans Richardson, who had also tried in vain to observe the rotation by\nmagnetization, at Palmer Laboratory in Princeton [R1J-H In 1909 Samuel Jack-\nson Barnett, then at Tulane University, began the study of the inverse effect, mag-\nnetization by rotation, now known as the Barnett effect. All three papers appeared\nin 1915. Clearly the proof that\npermanently circulating electrons indeed exist meant far more to Einstein than\nonly the verification of a century-old hypothesis. Later in 1915\nhe wrote, 'As pointed out by Einstein and de Haas, [their] experiments indicate\nvery strongly that electrons can rotate in atoms without emission of energy radia-\ntion' [B3].*\nEinstein and de Haas took two sets of measurements. I am not aware of a similar confession by Einstein.\nLet us now return to our main topic, Einstein's final formulation of his theory\nof general relativity.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. He abandoned this linear invariance\nin a series of papers completed in November 1915, which culminate in the final\nform of his gravitational equations, presented on November 25. All\nthese statements taken together convince me that Einstein still believed in the 'old'\ntheory as late as July 1915, that between July and October he found objections\nto that theory, and that his final version was conceived and worked out between\nlate October and November 25. 'That fellow Einstein suits his convenience\n(Es ist bequem mil dem E.\nWhat made Einstein change his mind between July and October. Letters to\nSommerfeld [E42] and Lorentz [E25] show that he had found at least three objec-\ntions against the old theory: (1) its restricted covariance did not include uniform\nrotations, (2) the precession of the perihelion of Mercury came out too small by\na factor of about 2, and (3) his proof of October 1914 of the uniqueness of the\ngravitational Lagrangian was incorrect. Einstein got rid of all these shortcomings\nin a series of four brief articles. Einstein presents to the plenary session of the Prus-\nsian Academy a new version of general relativity 'based on the postulate of covar-\niance with respect to transformations with determinant 1' [E44].' (It should be said that in matters of science a heavy heart never lasted\nvery long for Einstein.'\nThe remaining flaw was, of course, Einstein's unnecessary restriction to uni-\nmodular transformations.\u2022\u201e\u201e, $\u201e\u201e correspond to Einstein's G^, Rf,, Sf, in [E44].\n252 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nHaving described this splitting of the Ricci tensor, Einstein next proposed his\npenultimate version of the gravitational equations:\ncovariant under local unimodular transformations. Einstein's proof of this last statement is by far the most important\npart of this paper.\nThe phrase italicized in the above quotation shows that Einstein's understand-\ning of general covariance had vastly improved. Einstein did not say all this explic-\nitly in his paper.'\nDuring the next two weeks, Einstein believed that his new equation (Eq. Einstein still subscribes to the demands of\nunimodular invariance and \\/g = 1 \u2022 On the basis of this 'most radical relativity\ntheory,' he presents two of his greatest discoveries [E48].' This discovery was, I believe, by far the strongest emo-\ntional experience in Einstein's scientific life, perhaps in all his life.\nEinstein's discovery resolved a difficulty that was known for more than sixty\nyears. The experimental number quoted\nby Einsteintf on November 18, 1915, was 45\" \u00b1 5 [E48].\na) Einstein started from his field equations\nr^ = 0 (14. Either way, the answers for the effect are, of course, the same, a fact\nEinstein became aware of in the course of preparing his paper [E50]. Einstein asked for a static isotropic solution\nof the metric (as it is now called [W5]).\nd) Two months later, on January 16, 1916, Einstein read a paper [S4] before\nthe Prussian Academy on behalf of Karl Schwarzschild, who was in the German\narmy at the Russian front at that time. The paper contained the exact solution of\nthe static isotropic gravitational field of a mass point, the first instance of a rigorous\nsolution of Einstein's full gravitational field equations. On February 24, 1916,\nEinstein read another paper by Schwarzschild [S5], this one giving the solution\nfor a mass point in the gravitational field of an incompressible fluid sphere. On June 29,\n1916, Einstein addressed the Prussian Academy [E51] to commemorate\nSchwarzschild, who had died on May 11 after a short illness contracted at the\nRussian front. Einstein devoted only half a page to his\nsecond discovery: the bending of light is twice as large as he had found earlier.\nIn Section 12d, I mentioned that Einstein did not know the Bianchi identities\n[W8]\nwhen he did his work with Grossmann.\nEinstein's brief belief in Eq.9 arose because in the November 4 paper Einstein had redefined his\n*Einstein inserted those gf, into gf,dx\"dx' = 0 and then applied Huyghens\" principle.3) in such a way that the conservation laws read\nOn November 28, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld that three years earlier he and\nGrossmann had considered Eq.*\nOn June 20, 1933, Einstein, exiled from Germany, gave a lecture at the Uni-\nversity of Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of relativity. Einstein and Hilbert**\nTo repeat, on November 25 Einstein presented his final version (Eq.

In December 1915, Einstein remarked that Hilbert's com-\nmitment to Mie's theory was unnecessary from the point of view of general rela-\ntivity [E53]. So had Einstein, a few weeks earlier [E44].\nI must return to Einstein and Hilbert, however.* The subject was general relativity. From\nthe period in which Einstein lectured, it is clear that his subject was the imperfect\ntheory described in his paper of October 1914. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915.\nThe most revealing source about the crucial month of November is the corre-\nspondence during that period between Einstein and Hilbert. Between November\n7 and 25, Einstein, otherwise a prolific letter writer, did not correspond with any-\none\u2014except Hilbert (if the Einstein archive in Princeton is complete in regard to\nthat period). The whole November correspondence may well have been triggered, it\nseems to me, by Einstein's knowledge that he was not the only one to have found\nflaws in this earlier work of his.\n*Einstein and Hilbert began corresponding at least as early as October 1912, when Einstein was\nstill in Zurich.\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E. Apparently Einstein has received a copy of Hilbert's\nwork.\nLet us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. It is true that Hilbert's paper contains the trace term which Einstein\nhad yet to introduce.\nThus it seems that one should not attach much significance either to Einstein's\nagreeing with Hilbert 'as far as I can see' or to Hilbert's agreeing with Einstein\n'as it seems to me' [H4]. (I leave aside the characterization of Einstein as a mathema-\ntician, which he never was nor pretended to be.

Cambridge University\nPress, Cambridge, 1911.", "Einstein_Symposium_Jerusalem_1915": " From Zurich to Berlin\nOn November 25, 1915, Einstein presented to the physics-mathematics section of\nthe Prussian Academy of Sciences a paper in which 'finally the general theory of\nrelativity is closed as a logical structure' [El].\nEinstein was still a professor at the ETII when he presented his report to the\nVienna meeting discussed in Chapter 13.\nIn the spring of 1913, Planck and Nernst had come to Zurich for the purpose\nof sounding out Einstein about his possible interest in moving to Berlin.*\nMuch later, Einstein recalled an interesting exchange between himself and\nPlanck during this Zurich visit.\nEinstein reacted rapidly and positively to the approach from Berlin.\nEncouraged by Einstein's response, Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg\njoined in signing a formal laudatio, the statement supporting a proposal for mem-\nbership, which was presented to the academy on June 12, 1913 [Kl]. A number of arrangements remained to be worked out,\nbut already in July 1913 Einstein wrote to a friend that he was going to be in\nBerlin by the spring of 1914 [E2]. 'In particular, the astronomers are important to me (at this time)' [E5].\nIn a letter [K3] sent to the academy on December 7, 1913, Einstein formally\naccepted membership and declared that he wished to begin his new position in\nApril 1914. On February 9, 1914, he gave a farewell talk before the Physical\nSociety of Zurich, in which he noted that 'we have progressed as little in the theory\nof gravitation as the physicists of the eighteenth century when they knew only\nCoulomb's law' [E6].\nThe Einsteins left Zurich in late March 1914. Soon after Mileva's arrival, the Einsteins separated. Einstein saw them off at the station. Einstein accepted. On April 26,\n1914, his first newspaper article appeared, entitled 'Vom Relativitatsprinzip,'\nAbout the relativity principle [E10].'**\nThis divergence in views on the future of relativity theory, characteristic for the\nperiod 1913-15, was much in evidence on the occasion of Einstein's inaugural\naddress before the Prussian Academy, on July 2, 1914 [E12].'\n**A 1915 review of relativity theory by Einstein [Ell] has the same tenor as his newspaper article.' Planck ended by expressing the hope that the expedition planned to\nobserve the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, would provide information about the\nbending of light predicted (not yet correctly) by Einstein. During\nthis period, he completed the general theory of relativity, found the correct values\nfor the bending of light and the displacement of the perihelion of Mercury, did\npioneering work on cosmology and on gravitational waves, introduced his A and\nB coefficients for radiative transitions, found a new derivation of Planck's radia-\ntion law\u2014and ran into his first troubles with causality in quantum physics.\nThis intense scientific activity did not banish from Einstein's mind a genuine\nand intense concern for the tragic events unfolding in the world around him.* It gave him joy to find colleagues\nwho 'stand above the situation and do not let themselves be driven by the murky\n* Einstein on Peace by Otto Nathan and Heinz Norden describes in detail Einstein's political activ-\nities during the First World War [Nl].\nAfter this digression on Einstein and the war, I return to the developments in\ngeneral relativity. We are in the fall of 1914, at which time Einstein wrote a long\npaper for the proceedings of the Prussian Academy [El6].\nWe saw in Section 12d that early in 1913 Einstein and Grossmann had been\n244 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nunable to find generally covariant gravitational field equations [El7] and that\nEinstein had given a 'physical argument' for the impossibility of such general\ncovariance. Now, late in 1914, Einstein reproduced this same argument in his\nlong paper. This\npaper gave rise to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita, early in\n1915. Einstein was grateful for hav-\ning these brought to his attention.\nIn summary, toward the end of 1914 Einstein could look back on a year which\nhad brought major changes to his personal life and his professional career.\n\"The slight extension of the set of allowed transformations given in the second Einstein-Grossmann\npaper [E23] (Section 12d) must have been found shortly afterward.\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 245\n14b. Interlude: Rotation by Magnetization\n'I firmly believe that the road taken is in principle the correct one and that later\n[people] will wonder about the great resistance the idea of general relativity is\npresently encountering' [E27]. This prophesy was made by Einstein in the first\nweek of 1915. It would be fulfilled before the year was out, but not until Einstein\nhad passed through a crisis followed by an exhausting struggle. At that time Einstein made good\nuse of a temporary guest appointment at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsan-\nstalt in Charlottenburg [K4].f In\nAugust 1913, when Lorentz sent congratulations to Einstein on his forthcoming\nappointment in Berlin, he must have added (the letter is lost) a query concerning\nde Haas, as is seen from Einstein's reply: 'At present, I do not know what to do\nin the matter of your son-in-law, since in Berlin I will have neither an institute\nnor an assistant.^\nI do not know when de Haas joined Einstein at the Reichsanstalt.\nSoon after the conclusion of their collaboration, Einstein wrote enthusiastically\nabout the results obtained.\n**It is sometimes incorrectly stated that a brief abstract of a talk by Einstein before the Prussian\nAcademy [E28] contains the announcement of the final formulation of his theory as published in\nNovember 1915 [Dl],\nfin October 1912 the Ehrenfests visited de Haas and his wife in Berlin\u2014at the suggestion of Lorentz\n[K5].\nHOn one occasion, Einstein referred in print to de Haas as Herr de Haas-Lorentz [E32].\nTwo other instances of related work prior to 1915 must be mentioned. I shall next outline the\nEdH work of 1915 and then state the interesting results obtained by Barnett at\nabout the same time [B2].*\nEinstein and de Haas took two sets of measurements.\n250 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n14c. On the first of January 1916, when it was all over, Einstein wrote\nto Lorentz, 'During the past autumn, the gradually dawning realization of the\nincorrectness of the old gravitational equations caused me hard times (bose Zei-\nten)' [E25]. For on July 7, 1915, Einstein described to Zangger the subject of lec-\ntures he had just given in Goettingen as 'die nun schon sehr geklarte\nGravitationstheorie,' the by now already quite clarified theory of gravitation\n[E38]. 'That fellow Einstein suits his convenience\n(Es ist bequem mil dem E. Einstein got rid of all these shortcomings\nin a series of four brief articles.'

On June 29,\n1916, Einstein addressed the Prussian Academy [E51] to commemorate\nSchwarzschild, who had died on May 11 after a short illness contracted at the\nRussian front.

I believe that [my paper] contains simultaneously the solution\nof the problems of Einstein and of Mie.\nf Mie's ideas on gravitation were referred to in Chapter 13. So had Einstein, a few weeks earlier [E44]. In this observation I see the simple and\nvery surprising solution of the problem of Riemann, who was the first to seek\ntheoretically for the connection between gravitation and light.\nTHE FIELD EQUATIONS OF GRAVITATION 259\ncredited Amalie Emmy Noether (who was in Goettingen in 1915) with the proof\nof the theorem about the four identities; Noether's theorem had meanwhile been\npublished, in 1918 [N4].\nI must return to Einstein and Hilbert, however.* The subject was general relativity. I have already mentioned that\nEinstein made his major advance in October-November 1915.\nThe most revealing source about the crucial month of November is the corre-\nspondence during that period between Einstein and Hilbert. Between November\n7 and 25, Einstein, otherwise a prolific letter writer, did not correspond with any-\none\u2014except Hilbert (if the Einstein archive in Princeton is complete in regard to\nthat period). The whole November correspondence may well have been triggered, it\nseems to me, by Einstein's knowledge that he was not the only one to have found\nflaws in this earlier work of his.\n*Einstein and Hilbert began corresponding at least as early as October 1912, when Einstein was\nstill in Zurich.\n260 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nNovember 15: E. Apparently Einstein has received a copy of Hilbert's\nwork.\nLet us come back to Einstein's paper of November 18. In May 1916\nEinstein gave a colloquium on Hilbert's work in Berlin [E61].

Electromagnetism was not the only area of physics that\nattracted his attention during those years.\nEinstein arrived at the general theory of relativity after thinking for eight years\nabout gravitation. In June 1905, Einstein at once gave special\nrelativity its ultimate form in the first paper he ever wrote on the subject. Both in 1905 and in\n1915, Einstein presented new fundamental principles. However, the new dynamics contained in the equations\nof general relativity has not been fully fathomed either during Einstein's life or in\nthe quarter of a century following his death. It is true that since 1915 the under-\n266\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 267\nstanding of general relativity has vastly improved, our faith in the theory has\ngrown, and no assured limitations on the validity of Einstein's theory have been\nencountered.\nHaving completed my portrait of Einstein as the creator of general relativity.\nI turn to a brief account of Einstein as its practitioner. Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2]. I have these five books near me for two reasons,\nfirst to remind me that these authoritative and up-to-date reviews of recent devel-\nopments free me from writing a full history of general relativity up to the present,\na task which in any event would far exceed the scope of this book and the com-\npetence of its author, and second to remind me that my own understanding would\nlack perspective if I failed to indicate the enormous changes that have taken place\nin the ways general relativity is practiced today as compared with the way things\nwere in Einstein's lifetime.\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915.) The first decade of general relativity ends with the announcement by\nEdwin Powell Hubble in December 1924 of an experimental result which settled\na debate that had been going on for well over a century: the first incontrovertible\nevidence for the existence of an extragalactic object, Messier 31, the Andromeda\nnebula [H3].\nThe number of those actively engaged in research in general relativity continued\nto remain small in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.' Stud-\nies of cosmological models and of special solutions to the Einstein equations con-\n*A brief history of cosmic distances is found in [W4].\n\u2022(\u2022The most detailed bibliography on relativity up to the beginning of 1924 was compiled by Lecat\n[L2]. A list of the principal papers on cosmology for the years 1917 to 1932 is found\nin[Rlj. There was also further research on the problem of motion (which had\ninterested Einstein since 1927), the question of if and how the equations of motion\nof a distribution of matter can be obtained as a consequence of the gravitational\nfield equations. As a result of discussions\nbetween Tolman and Oppenheimer and his co-workers, there appeared in 1939,\na pair of papers, one by Tolman on static solutions of Einstein's field equations\nfor fluid spheres [Tl] and one, directly following it, by Oppenheimer and George\nVolkoff entitled 'On massive neutron cores' [O2].\nWhich brings us to the change in style of general relativity after Einstein's\ndeath.\nDuring Einstein's lifetime, there was not one major international conference\n*I am indebted to Robert Serber for a discussion of the papers on neutron stars by Oppenheimer\nand his collaborators.\n270 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nexclusively devoted to relativity theory and gravitation. Its purpose was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of relativity. Einstein\nhimself had been invited to attend but had to decline for reasons of health. It marked the beginning of a\nseries of international congresses on general relativity and gravitation: GR1 was\nheld in Chapel Hill, N. The\n\"relativity family\" was born then. Some of the papers presented at the GR conferences after 1970 are found in the journal\nGeneral Relativity and Gravitation.\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 271\nulus for the vastly increased activity and the new directions in general relativity.\nThe few dozen practitioners in Einstein's days are followed by a new generation\nabout a hundred times more numerous. Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. All through December 1915 and January 1916, the cor-\nrespondence between Lorentz and Ehrenfest is intense and reveals much about\ntheir personalities. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. In a\nletter to Ehrenfest he writes, 'I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant result'\n[L3]. His reply to Lorentz's letter shows a glimpse of the despair that\nwould ultimately overwhelm him: 'Your remark \"I have congratulated Einstein\non his brilliant results\" has a similar meaning for me as when one Freemason\nrecognizes another by a secret sign' [E4].\nMeanwhile Lorentz had received a letter from Einstein in which the latter\nexpressed his happiness with Lorentz's praise. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6]. This may have\nencouraged Einstein\u2014who did not communicate all that badly\u2014to do more writ-\ning.\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\nCommenting on the status of experimental relativity in 1979, David Wilkinson\nremarked:\n[These] two early successes [\u2014the perihelion precession and the bending of\nlight\u2014were] followed by decades of painfully slow experimental progress.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments. For a summary of the\npresent status of the experimental verification of general relativity (excluding cos-\nmology), the reader should consult the report by Irwin Shapiro wherein it will be\nfound that, within the errors, all is well with the red shift (both astronomically\nand terrestrially), with the bending of light, with the precession of the perihelia\nof Mercury and other bodies, and also with the modern refined tests of the equiv-\n*This article was published both in the Annalen der Physik and, also in 1916, as a separate booklet\n[E7] which went through numerous printings and was also translated into English [E8].\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition.\nWhat did Einstein himself have to say in later years about the three successes.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.\nOne of these caught Einstein's attention in 1936 when R. In any event, to Mandl's delight [M5] Einstein went\non to publish a calculation of the dependence of the image intensity upon the\ndisplacement of the observer from the extended line of centers of the two stars\n[E12b].

One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2]. (In view of the relations between Hilbert and Einstein, it is of\ninterest to note that in this last paper Hilbert refers to his subject as 'the new\n*For references to later calculations of this effect, see [S6a].\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 275\nphysics of Einstein's relativity principle' [H6].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nI repeat one last time that neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of the Bian-\nchi identities in that crucial November.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.\nIn October 1916 Einstein came back to energy-momentum conservation [E16].**\nThis time he gave a general proof (free of coordinate conditions) that for any\nmatter Lagrangian L the energy-momentum tensor T1\" satisfies\nas a consequence of the gravitational field equations. Neither Hilbert nor Klein (nor, of course, Einstein) realized\nthat Eq.4, the contracted Bianchi identities, had been derived much earlier,\nfirst by the German mathematician Aurel Voss in 1880, then independently by\n*As Bargmann pointed out to me, Einstein first specializes to the coordinate condition \\Jg = 1 and\nthen introduces a variational principle without a Lagrange multiplier for this condition.\n**An English translation of this paper is included in the well-known collection of papers by Einstein,\nLorentz, Minkowksi, and Weyl [S7].\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi. In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7]. At that time, Noether herself\ntold a friend that a team in Goettingen, to which she also belonged, was perform-\ning calculations of the most difficult kind for Einstein but that 'none of us under-\nstands what they are good for' [Dl].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. Einstein emphasized that,\ndespite appearances, Eq.\nThese results are of particular interest in that they show how Einstein was both\nundaunted by and quite at home with Riemannian geometry, which he handled\nwith ingenuity. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq.9 marks the beginning of a new chapter in general\nrelativity. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time.\nMany related questions continue to be studied intensely in the era of renewed\nactivity following Einstein's death. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity.\nEinstein contributed the quadrupole formula.\nEven before relativity, Lorentz had conjectured in 1900 that gravitation 'can be\nattributed to actions which do not propagate with a velocity larger than that of\nlight' [L6]. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6]. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20].'\nPerhaps this renewed concern with quantum physics spurred him, a few months\nlater, to make one of his great contributions to quantum electrodynamics: in the\nfall of 1916 he introduced the concepts of spontaneous and induced transitions and\ngave a new derivation of Planck's radiation law [E21].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2. In 1937, Einstein briefly\nthought that gravitational waves do not exist (see Chapter 29). In the closing months\nof 1980, there appeared in the literature 'a contribution to the debate concerning\nthe validity of Einstein's quadrupole formula' [W16].\nThe difficulties in answering the above questions stem, of course, from the non-\nlinear nature of gravitation, an aspect not incorporated in Einstein's linearized\napproximation.\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end. It is the first occasion on which Einstein shows his excep-\ntional talent for drawing with sensitivity a portrait of a man and his work, placing\nhim in his time and speaking of his achievements and of his frailties with equal\ngrace.\nMach was successively a professor of mathematics, experimental physics, and\nphilosophy. In the obituary, Einstein lauded a number of diverse contributions\nbut reserved his highest praise for Mach's historical and critical analysis of\nmechanics [M6], a work that had profoundly influenced him since his student\ndays [E27], when he was introduced to it by Besso [E28].* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30]. In the obituary, Einstein cited extensively Mach's famous critique of New-\nton's concepts of absolute space and absolute motion and concluded, 'The cited\nplaces show that Mach clearly recognized the weak sides of classical mechanics\nand that he was not far from demanding a general theory of relativity, and that\nnearly half a century ago.** Einstein had Mach's discussion of rotational motion in mind\nwhen he wrote his own 1916 synopsis: its second section, entitled 'On the Grounds\nWhich Make Plausible an Extension of the [Special] Relativity Postulate,' begins\nwith the phrase:\nClassical mechanics, and the special theory of relativity not less, suffer from an\nepistemological shortcoming [the preferred position of uniform translation over\nall other types of relative motion] which was probably emphasized for the first\ntime by Mach. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein. In February 1916, Einstein gave a lecture\non the Foucault pendulum [E31]., the Einstein-Grossmann] theory' [E32]. In his later years, however,\nMach turned his back on relativity. as\nassuredly disclaim to be a forerunner of the relativists as I withhold from the\natomistic belief of the present day,' and added that to him relativity seemed 'to be\ngrowing more and more dogmatical' [M9]. Even so, Einstein's esteem for Mach never faltered.] was a consequence of\nan absorption capacity diminished by age, since the whole direction of thinking of\nthis theory is in concordance with that of Mach, so that it is justified to consider\nMach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity,' he wrote in 1930 [E33].\nIn the last interview given by Einstein, two weeks before his death, he reminisced\nwith evident pleasure about the one visit he had paid to Mach and he spoke of\nfour people he admired: Newton, Lorentz, Planck, and Mach [G2]. They, and\nMaxwell, and no others, are the only ones Einstein ever accepted as his true\nprecursors.\nIn a discussion of Mach's influence on Einstein, it is necessary to make a clear\ndistinction between three themes. As we have just seen, in\nthis regard Einstein's respect was and remained unqualified.\n'Mach fought and broke the dogmatism of nineteenth century physics' is one of\nthe rare approving statements Einstein ever made about Mach's philosophical\npositions [E34]. Just before his death,\nEinstein said he had always believed that the invention of scientific concepts\nand the building of theories upon them was one of the creative properties of the\nhuman mind.'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27]. I would venture to guess that at this point Einstein had once again Mach's mechanics in\nmind.\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle. Let us\nsee how Einstein read Mach.\nSoon after Einstein arrived in Prague and broke his long silence on gravitation,\nhe published a short note entitled 'Does There Exist a Gravitational Action Anal-\nogous to the Electrodynamical Induction Effect. In June 1913, Einstein\nwrote to Mach about the induction effect as well as about the bending of light,\nadding that, if these effects were found, it would be 'a brilliant confirmation of\nyour ingenious investigations on the foundations of mechanics' [E38]. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39]. He men-\ntioned neither this hypothesis nor the problem of inertia in any of his subsequent\narticles until February 1917, when he submitted a paper [E40] which once again\nmarks the beginning of a new chapter in physics: general relativistic cosmology.\nA few days before presenting this paper to the Prussian Academy, Einstein had\nwritten to Ehrenfest, 'I have . It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].\nEinstein's paper is no doubt motivated by Machian ideas.17 is replaced by\n \n*For details and references to cosmology in the nineteenth century, see especially [P7] and [N6].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable. There are three\nmain points in Einstein's paper. First, he performs the very same transition in\ngeneral relativity, that is, he replaces\n \nby\n(15. Third, he proposes a dynamic realization of the relativity of\ninertia. His solution, the Einsteinian universe, had to be abolished in later years.\nEinstein had applied Eq.' Thus Einstein began to give concrete form to\nMach's ideas: since the g^ determine the inertial action, they should, in turn, be\ncompletely determined by the mass distribution in the universe.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1.\nIn later years, Einstein's enthusiasm for Mach's principle waned and finally\nvanished. I conclude with a brief chronology of his subsequent involvement with\ncosmology. Einstein never said so explicitly, but it seems reasonable to assume that\nhe had in mind that the correct equations should have no solutions at all in the\nabsence of matter.' Einstein must have\nbeen disappointed.\n1919. Einstein suggests [E43] that perhaps electrically-charged particles are\nheld together by gravitational forces. This idea\nmay be considered Einstein's first attempt at a unified field theory.22)288 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7922. Einstein first believes the reasoning is incorrect [E45], then finds an error\nin his own objection [E46] and calls the new results 'clarifying. This leads Einstein to write to Weyl, 'If there is no quasi-\nstatic world, then away with the cosmological term' [E47]. Referring to the theoretical work by Friedmann, 'which was not influ-\nenced by experimental facts' and the experimental discoveries of Hubble, 'which\nthe general theory of relativity can account for in an unforced way, namely, with-\nout a A term' Einstein formally abandons the cosmological term, which is 'theo-\nretically unsatisfactory anyway' [E48]. Einstein writes to a colleague, 'Von dem Mach'schen Prinzip sollte\nman eigentlich iiberhaupt nicht mehr sprechen,' As a matter of fact, one should\nno longer speak of Mach's principle at all [E51]. After Einstein, the Mach principle faded but never died.\nIn the post-Einsteinian era of revitalized interest in general relativity, it has\nbecome an important topic of research. Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper. As to the big bang,\nEinstein's last words on that subject were, 'One may .\nThe scientific task which Einstein set himself in his later years is based on three\ndesiderata, all of them vitally important to him: to unify gravitation and electro-\nmagnetism, to derive quantum physics from an underlying causal theory, and to\ndescribe particles as singularity-free solutions of continuous fields. As Einstein saw it, Maxwell's introduction of the field concept\nwas a revolutionary advance which, however, did not go far enough. [E55]\nThat is the clearest expression I know of Einstein's profound belief in a descrip-\ntion of the world exclusively in terms of everywhere-continuous fields.\nThere was a brief period, however, during which Einstein thought that singu-\nlarities might be inevitable.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed. These phrases are found in a paper, prepared with Jacob Grommer,\nin which Einstein made his first contribution to the problem of motion. In other words, was\nthe separate postulate of geodesic motion, already introduced by Einstein in 1914,\nunnecessary.\nA few weeks later, Weyl wrote to Einstein, thanking him for the opportunity\nto see the galley proofs of his new paper and 'for the support [this paper] gives to\nmy old idea about matter' [W20], adding a reference to an article he had written\nin 1922 [W21] in which similar conclusions had been reached. Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's reply to Weyl is especially interesting because it adds to our under-\nstanding of his interest in this problem at that time.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion. It is the work done with Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann\n\"Havas's paper, which also contains a simple derivation of the Einstein-Grommer result, is one of\nseveral important articles on the problem of motion in modern guise found in a volume edited by J. There was a debate on\nrelativistic thermodynamics, a controversial subject to this day. There were reports\non the fundamental advances of our understanding regarding the general structure\nof relativity theory, with special reference to singularity theorems, black holes, and\ncosmic censorship. Choquet-Bruhat told me that Einstein did not show much interest in this problem when\nshe once discussed it with him.\n292 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEOR\non asymmetries in the universe.

The probability of an atomic transition accom-\npanied by gravitational radiation is some fifty powers of 10 less than for photon\nemission. We have to look to the heavens for the best sources of gravitational\nradiation, most particularly to exotic, violent, and rare stellar phenomena such as\nthe collapse of star cores into neutron stars or supernovas; or the formation of\nblack holes. The hope is not just to observe gravitational waves but\nto use them for a new kind of experimental astronomy.\nDetailed accounts and literature referring to all these extraordinarily interesting\nand challenging aspects of gravitational wave physics are found in some of the\nbooks mentioned earlier in this chapter. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6]. He also pointed out that the existence of radiationless\nstable interatomic orbits is equally mysterious from the electromagnetic as from\nthe gravitational point of view.\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R. At that time he mistakenly believed that a\npermanently spherically symmetric mechanical system can emit gravitational\nradiation. There the matter lay until he corrected this error in 1918 and presented\nthe quadrupole formula [E22]: the energy loss of the mechanical system is given\nby*\nwhere\nis the mass quadrupole moment and p the mass density of the source.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves. In 1937 he\nand Rosen studied cylindrical wave solutions of the exact gravitational equations\n[E23], which were analyzed further in [W15].15 represents, of course, the\nleading term in a gravitational multipole expansion. If so, does the formula apply to those extreme circumstances mentioned\nabove, which may offer the most potent sources of gravitational radiation. In 1937, Einstein briefly\nthought that gravitational waves do not exist (see Chapter 29). 'Among the present\nday theoretical physicists there is a strong consensus that gravitational radiation\ndoes exist,' one reads in [H8].*\nFinally, as a gift from the heavens, there comes to us the binary pulsar\nPSR1913 + 16, 'the first known system in which relativistic gravity can be used\nas a practical tool for the determination of astrophysical parameters' [W17]. This\nsystem offers the possibility of testing whether the quantitative general relativistic\nprediction of a change in period due to energy loss arising from gravitational quad-\nrupole radiation holds true.\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7.

In June 1905, Einstein at once gave special\nrelativity its ultimate form in the first paper he ever wrote on the subject. Both in 1905 and in\n1915, Einstein presented new fundamental principles. As I have stressed repeat-\nedly, the theory of 1905 was purely kinematic in character. However, the new dynamics contained in the equations\nof general relativity has not been fully fathomed either during Einstein's life or in\nthe quarter of a century following his death.

For the present, I exclude\nhis work on unified field theory, a subject that will be dealt with separately in\nChapter 17. Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2]. I have these five books near me for two reasons,\nfirst to remind me that these authoritative and up-to-date reviews of recent devel-\nopments free me from writing a full history of general relativity up to the present,\na task which in any event would far exceed the scope of this book and the com-\npetence of its author, and second to remind me that my own understanding would\nlack perspective if I failed to indicate the enormous changes that have taken place\nin the ways general relativity is practiced today as compared with the way things\nwere in Einstein's lifetime.\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The number of participating theoretical\nphysicists is small but growing. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915.) The first decade of general relativity ends with the announcement by\nEdwin Powell Hubble in December 1924 of an experimental result which settled\na debate that had been going on for well over a century: the first incontrovertible\nevidence for the existence of an extragalactic object, Messier 31, the Andromeda\nnebula [H3].f Several attempts to revert to a neo-Euclidean theory\nof gravitation and cosmology were also made in this period [N4]. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.'

There was also further research on the problem of motion (which had\ninterested Einstein since 1927), the question of if and how the equations of motion\nof a distribution of matter can be obtained as a consequence of the gravitational\nfield equations. As a result of discussions\nbetween Tolman and Oppenheimer and his co-workers, there appeared in 1939,\na pair of papers, one by Tolman on static solutions of Einstein's field equations\nfor fluid spheres [Tl] and one, directly following it, by Oppenheimer and George\nVolkoff entitled 'On massive neutron cores' [O2].)**\nHalf a year later, the paper 'On continued gravitational attraction' by Oppenhei-\nmer and Hartland Snyder came out [O3].' Thus began\nthe physics of black holes, the name for the ultimate collapsed state proposed by\nJohn Archibald Wheeler at a conference held in the fall of 1967 at the Goddard\nInstitute of Space Studies in New York [W5].\nWhich brings us to the change in style of general relativity after Einstein's\ndeath.\nDuring Einstein's lifetime, there was not one major international conference\n*I am indebted to Robert Serber for a discussion of the papers on neutron stars by Oppenheimer\nand his collaborators.\n270 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nexclusively devoted to relativity theory and gravitation.

Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. In a\nletter to Ehrenfest he writes, 'I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant result'\n[L3]. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6]. This may have\nencouraged Einstein\u2014who did not communicate all that badly\u2014to do more writ-\ning.\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments.

[W8]\nWith fervent good wishes and with high hopes for further experiments with rock-\nets, satellites, and planetary probes, I hereby leave the subject of the comparison\nbetween theory and experiment in general relativity.\nWhat did Einstein himself have to say in later years about the three successes. In 1930 he wrote, 'I do not consider the main significance\nof the general theory of relativity to be the prediction of some tiny observable\neffects, but rather the simplicity of its foundations and its consistency' [E10]. Again in 1930 he expressed the opinion that\nthe idea of general relativity 'is a purely formal point of view and not a definite\nhypothesis about nature. In 1932 he went further: 'In\nmy opinion this theory [general relativity] possesses little inner probability.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.\nOne of these caught Einstein's attention in 1936 when R. Energy and Momentum Conservation; the Bianchi Identities\nThe collected works of Felix Klein contain a set of papers devoted to the links\nbetween geometry on the one hand and group theory and the theory of invariants\non the other, his own Erlangen program. The last three articles of this set deal\nwith general relativity. the theory of relativity and its connection\nwith his old ideas of the Erlangen program brought the last flare-up of his math-\nematical interests and mathematical production' [W9].) One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2].\nIn November 1915, neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of this royal road\nto the conservation laws. He believed that these ident-\nities meant that electromagnetism is a consequence of gravitation and failed to see\nthat this theorem at once yields the conservation laws [H4]. (In view of the relations between Hilbert and Einstein, it is of\ninterest to note that in this last paper Hilbert refers to his subject as 'the new\n*For references to later calculations of this effect, see [S6a].\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 275\nphysics of Einstein's relativity principle' [H6].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nI repeat one last time that neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of the Bian-\nchi identities in that crucial November.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.\nIn October 1916 Einstein came back to energy-momentum conservation [E16].**\nThis time he gave a general proof (free of coordinate conditions) that for any\nmatter Lagrangian L the energy-momentum tensor T1\" satisfies\nas a consequence of the gravitational field equations. Neither Hilbert nor Klein (nor, of course, Einstein) realized\nthat Eq.4, the contracted Bianchi identities, had been derived much earlier,\nfirst by the German mathematician Aurel Voss in 1880, then independently by\n*As Bargmann pointed out to me, Einstein first specializes to the coordinate condition \\Jg = 1 and\nthen introduces a variational principle without a Lagrange multiplier for this condition.\n**An English translation of this paper is included in the well-known collection of papers by Einstein,\nLorentz, Minkowksi, and Weyl [S7].\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi. In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7]. At that time, Noether herself\ntold a friend that a team in Goettingen, to which she also belonged, was perform-\ning calculations of the most difficult kind for Einstein but that 'none of us under-\nstands what they are good for' [Dl].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. Einstein emphasized that,\ndespite appearances, Eq.\nThese results are of particular interest in that they show how Einstein was both\nundaunted by and quite at home with Riemannian geometry, which he handled\nwith ingenuity. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq.9 marks the beginning of a new chapter in general\nrelativity. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time.\nMany related questions continue to be studied intensely in the era of renewed\nactivity following Einstein's death. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity.\nEinstein contributed the quadrupole formula.\nEven before relativity, Lorentz had conjectured in 1900 that gravitation 'can be\nattributed to actions which do not propagate with a velocity larger than that of\nlight' [L6]. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6]. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20]. For the source-free case, he showed that\nthe quantities\nsatisfy (D is the Dalembertian)\n28O RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nin a coordinate system for which the 'gauge condition'\nholds true (Eq.'\nPerhaps this renewed concern with quantum physics spurred him, a few months\nlater, to make one of his great contributions to quantum electrodynamics: in the\nfall of 1916 he introduced the concepts of spontaneous and induced transitions and\ngave a new derivation of Planck's radiation law [E21].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R. At that time he mistakenly believed that a\npermanently spherically symmetric mechanical system can emit gravitational\nradiation. There the matter lay until he corrected this error in 1918 and presented\nthe quadrupole formula [E22]: the energy loss of the mechanical system is given\nby*\nwhere\nis the mass quadrupole moment and p the mass density of the source.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2. In 1937, Einstein briefly\nthought that gravitational waves do not exist (see Chapter 29). In the closing months\nof 1980, there appeared in the literature 'a contribution to the debate concerning\nthe validity of Einstein's quadrupole formula' [W16].\nThe difficulties in answering the above questions stem, of course, from the non-\nlinear nature of gravitation, an aspect not incorporated in Einstein's linearized\napproximation.\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end.\nMach was successively a professor of mathematics, experimental physics, and\nphilosophy. In the obituary, Einstein lauded a number of diverse contributions\nbut reserved his highest praise for Mach's historical and critical analysis of\nmechanics [M6], a work that had profoundly influenced him since his student\ndays [E27], when he was introduced to it by Besso [E28].* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30]. In the obituary, Einstein cited extensively Mach's famous critique of New-\nton's concepts of absolute space and absolute motion and concluded, 'The cited\nplaces show that Mach clearly recognized the weak sides of classical mechanics\nand that he was not far from demanding a general theory of relativity, and that\nnearly half a century ago.** Einstein had Mach's discussion of rotational motion in mind\nwhen he wrote his own 1916 synopsis: its second section, entitled 'On the Grounds\nWhich Make Plausible an Extension of the [Special] Relativity Postulate,' begins\nwith the phrase:\nClassical mechanics, and the special theory of relativity not less, suffer from an\nepistemological shortcoming [the preferred position of uniform translation over\nall other types of relative motion] which was probably emphasized for the first\ntime by Mach. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein.\n**In this connection, readers may wish to refresh their memory about Newton's rotating bucket\nexperiment and Mach's analysis thereof; see, e.

Even so, Einstein's esteem for Mach never faltered.] was a consequence of\nan absorption capacity diminished by age, since the whole direction of thinking of\nthis theory is in concordance with that of Mach, so that it is justified to consider\nMach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity,' he wrote in 1930 [E33].\nIn the last interview given by Einstein, two weeks before his death, he reminisced\nwith evident pleasure about the one visit he had paid to Mach and he spoke of\nfour people he admired: Newton, Lorentz, Planck, and Mach [G2]. They, and\nMaxwell, and no others, are the only ones Einstein ever accepted as his true\nprecursors.\nIn a discussion of Mach's influence on Einstein, it is necessary to make a clear\ndistinction between three themes.\nFirst, Mach's emphasis on the relativity of all motion. As we have just seen, in\nthis regard Einstein's respect was and remained unqualified.\n'Mach fought and broke the dogmatism of nineteenth century physics' is one of\nthe rare approving statements Einstein ever made about Mach's philosophical\npositions [E34]. Just before his death,\nEinstein said he had always believed that the invention of scientific concepts\nand the building of theories upon them was one of the creative properties of the\nhuman mind.'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27]. I would venture to guess that at this point Einstein had once again Mach's mechanics in\nmind.\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle. Let us\nsee how Einstein read Mach.\nSoon after Einstein arrived in Prague and broke his long silence on gravitation,\nhe published a short note entitled 'Does There Exist a Gravitational Action Anal-\nogous to the Electrodynamical Induction Effect.\nIn this note Einstein declared, 'This [conclusion] lends plausibility to the con-\njecture that the total inertia of a mass point is an effect due to the presence of all\nother masses, due to a sort of interaction with the latter. In the Einstein-Gross-\nmann paper we read of 'Mach's bold idea that inertia originates in the interaction\nof [a given] mass point with all other [masses]' [E37]. In June 1913, Einstein\nwrote to Mach about the induction effect as well as about the bending of light,\nadding that, if these effects were found, it would be 'a brilliant confirmation of\nyour ingenious investigations on the foundations of mechanics' [E38]. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39]. He men-\ntioned neither this hypothesis nor the problem of inertia in any of his subsequent\narticles until February 1917, when he submitted a paper [E40] which once again\nmarks the beginning of a new chapter in physics: general relativistic cosmology. again perpetrated something about gravitation\ntheory which somewhat exposes me to the danger of being confined in a madhouse'\n[E41]. It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].\nEinstein's paper is no doubt motivated by Machian ideas.17 is replaced by\n \n*For details and references to cosmology in the nineteenth century, see especially [P7] and [N6].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable. Einstein had no such physical grounds\nfor assuming these two properties\u2014except for the fact that, he believed, they led\nto the first realization of the relativity of inertia in the model he was about to\nunveil. There are three\nmain points in Einstein's paper.21 that resolves the conundrum of the\nNewtonian infinite. Third, he proposes a dynamic realization of the relativity of\ninertia. His solution, the Einsteinian universe, had to be abolished in later years.\nEinstein had applied Eq. First, the old problem of the Newtonian infinite remains.' Thus Einstein began to give concrete form to\nMach's ideas: since the g^ determine the inertial action, they should, in turn, be\ncompletely determined by the mass distribution in the universe. In this Einsteinian universe, the Newtonian\ninfinite no longer causes problems because it has been abolished; three-dimen-\nsional space is spherically bounded and has a time-independent curvature.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1. The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance\n2.\nIn later years, Einstein's enthusiasm for Mach's principle waned and finally\nvanished. I conclude with a brief chronology of his subsequent involvement with\ncosmology. Einstein never said so explicitly, but it seems reasonable to assume that\nhe had in mind that the correct equations should have no solutions at all in the\nabsence of matter.' Einstein must have\nbeen disappointed.\n1919. Einstein suggests [E43] that perhaps electrically-charged particles are\nheld together by gravitational forces. This idea\nmay be considered Einstein's first attempt at a unified field theory.22)288 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7922. Einstein first believes the reasoning is incorrect [E45], then finds an error\nin his own objection [E46] and calls the new results 'clarifying. This leads Einstein to write to Weyl, 'If there is no quasi-\nstatic world, then away with the cosmological term' [E47]. Referring to the theoretical work by Friedmann, 'which was not influ-\nenced by experimental facts' and the experimental discoveries of Hubble, 'which\nthe general theory of relativity can account for in an unforced way, namely, with-\nout a A term' Einstein formally abandons the cosmological term, which is 'theo-\nretically unsatisfactory anyway' [E48]. Einstein writes to a colleague, 'Von dem Mach'schen Prinzip sollte\nman eigentlich iiberhaupt nicht mehr sprechen,' As a matter of fact, one should\nno longer speak of Mach's principle at all [E51]. After Einstein, the Mach principle faded but never died.\nIn the post-Einsteinian era of revitalized interest in general relativity, it has\nbecome an important topic of research. I am told that the Zeitschrift fur Physik no longer accepts\npapers on general relativity on the grounds that articles on Mach's principle pro-\nvoke too many polemical replies. Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper. As to the big bang,\nEinstein's last words on that subject were, 'One may .\nThe scientific task which Einstein set himself in his later years is based on three\ndesiderata, all of them vitally important to him: to unify gravitation and electro-\nmagnetism, to derive quantum physics from an underlying causal theory, and to\ndescribe particles as singularity-free solutions of continuous fields. I add a com-\nment on this last point (unified field theory and quantum theory will be discussed\nin later chapters). As Einstein saw it, Maxwell's introduction of the field concept\nwas a revolutionary advance which, however, did not go far enough. [E55]\nThat is the clearest expression I know of Einstein's profound belief in a descrip-\ntion of the world exclusively in terms of everywhere-continuous fields.\nThere was a brief period, however, during which Einstein thought that singu-\nlarities might be inevitable.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed. These phrases are found in a paper, prepared with Jacob Grommer,\nin which Einstein made his first contribution to the problem of motion. In other words, was\nthe separate postulate of geodesic motion, already introduced by Einstein in 1914,\nunnecessary.\nA few weeks later, Weyl wrote to Einstein, thanking him for the opportunity\nto see the galley proofs of his new paper and 'for the support [this paper] gives to\nmy old idea about matter' [W20], adding a reference to an article he had written\nin 1922 [W21] in which similar conclusions had been reached. Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's reply to Weyl is especially interesting because it adds to our under-\nstanding of his interest in this problem at that time.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion. It is the work done with Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann\n\"Havas's paper, which also contains a simple derivation of the Einstein-Grommer result, is one of\nseveral important articles on the problem of motion in modern guise found in a volume edited by J.

There were reports\non the fundamental advances of our understanding regarding the general structure\nof relativity theory, with special reference to singularity theorems, black holes, and\ncosmic censorship.

Both in 1905 and in\n1915, Einstein presented new fundamental principles.\nHaving completed my portrait of Einstein as the creator of general relativity.\nI turn to a brief account of Einstein as its practitioner. Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2].\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann.

Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. In a\nletter to Ehrenfest he writes, 'I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant result'\n[L3]. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content.\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments.\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition.\nWhat did Einstein himself have to say in later years about the three successes.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.)

In June 1905, Einstein at once gave special\nrelativity its ultimate form in the first paper he ever wrote on the subject. Both in 1905 and in\n1915, Einstein presented new fundamental principles. However, the new dynamics contained in the equations\nof general relativity has not been fully fathomed either during Einstein's life or in\nthe quarter of a century following his death. It is true that since 1915 the under-\n266\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 267\nstanding of general relativity has vastly improved, our faith in the theory has\ngrown, and no assured limitations on the validity of Einstein's theory have been\nencountered.\nHaving completed my portrait of Einstein as the creator of general relativity.\nI turn to a brief account of Einstein as its practitioner. Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2]. I have these five books near me for two reasons,\nfirst to remind me that these authoritative and up-to-date reviews of recent devel-\nopments free me from writing a full history of general relativity up to the present,\na task which in any event would far exceed the scope of this book and the com-\npetence of its author, and second to remind me that my own understanding would\nlack perspective if I failed to indicate the enormous changes that have taken place\nin the ways general relativity is practiced today as compared with the way things\nwere in Einstein's lifetime.\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915.) The first decade of general relativity ends with the announcement by\nEdwin Powell Hubble in December 1924 of an experimental result which settled\na debate that had been going on for well over a century: the first incontrovertible\nevidence for the existence of an extragalactic object, Messier 31, the Andromeda\nnebula [H3]. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.'

A list of the principal papers on cosmology for the years 1917 to 1932 is found\nin[Rlj. As a result of discussions\nbetween Tolman and Oppenheimer and his co-workers, there appeared in 1939,\na pair of papers, one by Tolman on static solutions of Einstein's field equations\nfor fluid spheres [Tl] and one, directly following it, by Oppenheimer and George\nVolkoff entitled 'On massive neutron cores' [O2].\nWhich brings us to the change in style of general relativity after Einstein's\ndeath.\nDuring Einstein's lifetime, there was not one major international conference\n*I am indebted to Robert Serber for a discussion of the papers on neutron stars by Oppenheimer\nand his collaborators.\n270 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nexclusively devoted to relativity theory and gravitation. Its purpose was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of relativity. Einstein\nhimself had been invited to attend but had to decline for reasons of health. It marked the beginning of a\nseries of international congresses on general relativity and gravitation: GR1 was\nheld in Chapel Hill, N. The\n\"relativity family\" was born then. Some of the papers presented at the GR conferences after 1970 are found in the journal\nGeneral Relativity and Gravitation.\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 271\nulus for the vastly increased activity and the new directions in general relativity.\nThe few dozen practitioners in Einstein's days are followed by a new generation\nabout a hundred times more numerous. Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. In a\nletter to Ehrenfest he writes, 'I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant result'\n[L3]. His reply to Lorentz's letter shows a glimpse of the despair that\nwould ultimately overwhelm him: 'Your remark \"I have congratulated Einstein\non his brilliant results\" has a similar meaning for me as when one Freemason\nrecognizes another by a secret sign' [E4]. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible. 'I had written to Einstein that, now that he has reached the acme of\nhis theory, it would be important to give an expose of its principles in as simple\na form as possible, so that every physicist (or anyway many of them) may famil-\niarize himself with its content. This may have\nencouraged Einstein\u2014who did not communicate all that badly\u2014to do more writ-\ning.\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments.\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition.\nWhat did Einstein himself have to say in later years about the three successes.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.\nOne of these caught Einstein's attention in 1936 when R. the theory of relativity and its connection\nwith his old ideas of the Erlangen program brought the last flare-up of his math-\nematical interests and mathematical production' [W9].) One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2].\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 275\nphysics of Einstein's relativity principle' [H6].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nI repeat one last time that neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of the Bian-\nchi identities in that crucial November.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.\nIn October 1916 Einstein came back to energy-momentum conservation [E16].\n**An English translation of this paper is included in the well-known collection of papers by Einstein,\nLorentz, Minkowksi, and Weyl [S7].\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi. In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7]. At that time, Noether herself\ntold a friend that a team in Goettingen, to which she also belonged, was perform-\ning calculations of the most difficult kind for Einstein but that 'none of us under-\nstands what they are good for' [Dl].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. Einstein emphasized that,\ndespite appearances, Eq.\nThese results are of particular interest in that they show how Einstein was both\nundaunted by and quite at home with Riemannian geometry, which he handled\nwith ingenuity. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time.\nMany related questions continue to be studied intensely in the era of renewed\nactivity following Einstein's death.\nEinstein contributed the quadrupole formula. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2. In the closing months\nof 1980, there appeared in the literature 'a contribution to the debate concerning\nthe validity of Einstein's quadrupole formula' [W16].\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end. It is the first occasion on which Einstein shows his excep-\ntional talent for drawing with sensitivity a portrait of a man and his work, placing\nhim in his time and speaking of his achievements and of his frailties with equal\ngrace.\nMach was successively a professor of mathematics, experimental physics, and\nphilosophy. In the obituary, Einstein lauded a number of diverse contributions\nbut reserved his highest praise for Mach's historical and critical analysis of\nmechanics [M6], a work that had profoundly influenced him since his student\ndays [E27], when he was introduced to it by Besso [E28].* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30]. In the obituary, Einstein cited extensively Mach's famous critique of New-\nton's concepts of absolute space and absolute motion and concluded, 'The cited\nplaces show that Mach clearly recognized the weak sides of classical mechanics\nand that he was not far from demanding a general theory of relativity, and that\nnearly half a century ago. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein. In February 1916, Einstein gave a lecture\non the Foucault pendulum [E31]., the Einstein-Grossmann] theory' [E32]. Even so, Einstein's esteem for Mach never faltered.] was a consequence of\nan absorption capacity diminished by age, since the whole direction of thinking of\nthis theory is in concordance with that of Mach, so that it is justified to consider\nMach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity,' he wrote in 1930 [E33].\nIn the last interview given by Einstein, two weeks before his death, he reminisced\nwith evident pleasure about the one visit he had paid to Mach and he spoke of\nfour people he admired: Newton, Lorentz, Planck, and Mach [G2]. They, and\nMaxwell, and no others, are the only ones Einstein ever accepted as his true\nprecursors.\nIn a discussion of Mach's influence on Einstein, it is necessary to make a clear\ndistinction between three themes. As we have just seen, in\nthis regard Einstein's respect was and remained unqualified.\n'Mach fought and broke the dogmatism of nineteenth century physics' is one of\nthe rare approving statements Einstein ever made about Mach's philosophical\npositions [E34].'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27]. I would venture to guess that at this point Einstein had once again Mach's mechanics in\nmind.\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle. Let us\nsee how Einstein read Mach. In June 1913, Einstein\nwrote to Mach about the induction effect as well as about the bending of light,\nadding that, if these effects were found, it would be 'a brilliant confirmation of\nyour ingenious investigations on the foundations of mechanics' [E38]. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39]. He men-\ntioned neither this hypothesis nor the problem of inertia in any of his subsequent\narticles until February 1917, when he submitted a paper [E40] which once again\nmarks the beginning of a new chapter in physics: general relativistic cosmology.\nA few days before presenting this paper to the Prussian Academy, Einstein had\nwritten to Ehrenfest, 'I have . It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].\nEinstein's paper is no doubt motivated by Machian ideas.17 is replaced by\n \n*For details and references to cosmology in the nineteenth century, see especially [P7] and [N6].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable. There are three\nmain points in Einstein's paper. His solution, the Einsteinian universe, had to be abolished in later years.\nEinstein had applied Eq.' Thus Einstein began to give concrete form to\nMach's ideas: since the g^ determine the inertial action, they should, in turn, be\ncompletely determined by the mass distribution in the universe.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1.\nIn later years, Einstein's enthusiasm for Mach's principle waned and finally\nvanished. I conclude with a brief chronology of his subsequent involvement with\ncosmology. Einstein never said so explicitly, but it seems reasonable to assume that\nhe had in mind that the correct equations should have no solutions at all in the\nabsence of matter.' Einstein must have\nbeen disappointed.\n1919. This idea\nmay be considered Einstein's first attempt at a unified field theory.22)288 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7922. Einstein first believes the reasoning is incorrect [E45], then finds an error\nin his own objection [E46] and calls the new results 'clarifying. This leads Einstein to write to Weyl, 'If there is no quasi-\nstatic world, then away with the cosmological term' [E47]. Einstein writes to a colleague, 'Von dem Mach'schen Prinzip sollte\nman eigentlich iiberhaupt nicht mehr sprechen,' As a matter of fact, one should\nno longer speak of Mach's principle at all [E51]. After Einstein, the Mach principle faded but never died.\nIn the post-Einsteinian era of revitalized interest in general relativity, it has\nbecome an important topic of research. Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper.\nThe scientific task which Einstein set himself in his later years is based on three\ndesiderata, all of them vitally important to him: to unify gravitation and electro-\nmagnetism, to derive quantum physics from an underlying causal theory, and to\ndescribe particles as singularity-free solutions of continuous fields. [E55]\nThat is the clearest expression I know of Einstein's profound belief in a descrip-\ntion of the world exclusively in terms of everywhere-continuous fields.\nThere was a brief period, however, during which Einstein thought that singu-\nlarities might be inevitable.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed. These phrases are found in a paper, prepared with Jacob Grommer,\nin which Einstein made his first contribution to the problem of motion. In other words, was\nthe separate postulate of geodesic motion, already introduced by Einstein in 1914,\nunnecessary.\nA few weeks later, Weyl wrote to Einstein, thanking him for the opportunity\nto see the galley proofs of his new paper and 'for the support [this paper] gives to\nmy old idea about matter' [W20], adding a reference to an article he had written\nin 1922 [W21] in which similar conclusions had been reached. Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's reply to Weyl is especially interesting because it adds to our under-\nstanding of his interest in this problem at that time.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion. It is the work done with Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann\n\"Havas's paper, which also contains a simple derivation of the Einstein-Grommer result, is one of\nseveral important articles on the problem of motion in modern guise found in a volume edited by J.\n292 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEOR\non asymmetries in the universe.

I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.9 marks the beginning of a new chapter in general\nrelativity. Gravitational Waves\nAt no time during GR9 did I sense more strongly how much general relativity\nbelongs to the future than when I listened to the plenary lectures by Kip Thorne\nfrom Pasadena and Vladimir Braginsky from Moscow on the present state of\nexperiments designed to detect gravitational waves. The use of space probes in the search\nfor gravitational waves (in the range 10~2-10~4 Hz) by Doppler tracking is also\nbeing contemplated. The hope is not just to observe gravitational waves but\nto use them for a new kind of experimental astronomy. It is anticipated that gravitational wave\nastronomy may inform us about the dynamics of the evolution of supernova cores,\nneutron stars, and black holes. In addition, it may well be that gravitational waves\nwill provide us with experimental criteria for distinguishing between the orthodox\nEinsteinian general relativity and some of its modern variants.\nDetailed accounts and literature referring to all these extraordinarily interesting\nand challenging aspects of gravitational wave physics are found in some of the\nbooks mentioned earlier in this chapter. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6].\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R. At that time he mistakenly believed that a\npermanently spherically symmetric mechanical system can emit gravitational\nradiation.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves. In 1937 he\nand Rosen studied cylindrical wave solutions of the exact gravitational equations\n[E23], which were analyzed further in [W15].15 represents, of course, the\nleading term in a gravitational multipole expansion.\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 28l\nDo gravitational waves exist.\nThere exists an extensive and important literature on these questions, beginning\nin 1922 with a remark by Eddington, who believed that the waves were spurious\nand 'propagate . In 1937, Einstein briefly\nthought that gravitational waves do not exist (see Chapter 29). 'Among the present\nday theoretical physicists there is a strong consensus that gravitational radiation\ndoes exist,' one reads in [H8].15 holds true (in the long-wavelength,\nslow-motion approximation) for nongravitational sources of gravitational waves,\nsuch as elastically vibrating bars. The hard question is what happens if both\nmaterial sources and the gravitational field itself are included as sources of grav-\nitational waves.*\nFinally, as a gift from the heavens, there comes to us the binary pulsar\nPSR1913 + 16, 'the first known system in which relativistic gravity can be used\nas a practical tool for the determination of astrophysical parameters' [W17]. This result does, of course, not prove the validity\nof the quadrupole formula, nor does it diminish the urge to observe gravitational\nwaves directly.\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7.

In June 1905, Einstein at once gave special\nrelativity its ultimate form in the first paper he ever wrote on the subject. Both in 1905 and in\n1915, Einstein presented new fundamental principles. By\ncontrast, general relativity consists of an intricate web of new kinematics and new\ndynamics. However, the new dynamics contained in the equations\nof general relativity has not been fully fathomed either during Einstein's life or in\nthe quarter of a century following his death. It is true that since 1915 the under-\n266\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 267\nstanding of general relativity has vastly improved, our faith in the theory has\ngrown, and no assured limitations on the validity of Einstein's theory have been\nencountered. Yet, even on the purely classical level, no one today would claim to\nhave a full grasp of the rich dynamic content of the nonlinear dynamics called\ngeneral relativity.\nHaving completed my portrait of Einstein as the creator of general relativity.\nI turn to a brief account of Einstein as its practitioner. Obviously, copies of\nEinstein's papers are at hand. In addition, I have the following books within\nreach: Pauli's encyclopedia article on relativity completed in 1920 [PI] as well as\nits English translation [P2], of particular interest because of the notes Pauli added\nin the mid-1950s; several editions of Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (including the\nEnglish translation of the fourth edition [Wl]), of importance because the vari-\nances in the different editions are helpful for an understanding of the evolution of\ngeneral relativity in the first decade after its creation; the book by North dealing\nwith the history of modern cosmology to 1965 [Nl]; the fine source book on cos-\nmology published by the American Association of Physics Teachers [SI]; and, for\ndiversion, the collection of papers on cosmology assembled by Munitz [Ml], in\nwhich Plato appears as the oldest and my friend Dennis Sciama as the youngest\ncontributor. The modern texts by Weinberg [W2] and\nby Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [M2] (affectionately known as the 'telephone\nbook') serve as sources of information about developments in general relativity\nduring the rest of Einstein's life and the years beyond. Finally, my incomplete\nlittle library is brought up to date by a recent report of a workshop on sources and\ndetectors of gravitational radiation [S2], the Einstein centenary survey by Hawk-\ning and Israel [HI], the record of the centennial symposium in Princeton [W3],\nand the two centenary volumes published by the International Society on General\nRelativity and Gravitation [H2]. I have these five books near me for two reasons,\nfirst to remind me that these authoritative and up-to-date reviews of recent devel-\nopments free me from writing a full history of general relativity up to the present,\na task which in any event would far exceed the scope of this book and the com-\npetence of its author, and second to remind me that my own understanding would\nlack perspective if I failed to indicate the enormous changes that have taken place\nin the ways general relativity is practiced today as compared with the way things\nwere in Einstein's lifetime.\n268 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nIn preparation for the subsequent short sections which deal more directly with\nEinstein's work, I turn next to a general outline of the entire period from 1915 to\nthe present. The main\nadvances were the introduction in mathematics of parallel transport by Levi-Civ-\nita in 1917 [LI], a concept soon widely used in general relativity; the emergence\nof a better understanding of the energy-momentum conservation laws as the result\nof the work by Einstein, Hilbert, Felix Klein, Lorentz, Schroedinger, and Her-\nmann Weyl; Einstein's first papers on gravitational waves; and the pioneering\nexplorations of general relativistic cosmologies by Einstein, Willem de Sitter, and\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedmann. The solar eclipse expe-\nditions of 1919 demonstrated that light is bent by an amount close to Einstein's\nprediction [El] of November 18, 1915.) The first decade of general relativity ends with the announcement by\nEdwin Powell Hubble in December 1924 of an experimental result which settled\na debate that had been going on for well over a century: the first incontrovertible\nevidence for the existence of an extragalactic object, Messier 31, the Andromeda\nnebula [H3].f Several attempts to revert to a neo-Euclidean theory\nof gravitation and cosmology were also made in this period [N4].\nThe number of those actively engaged in research in general relativity continued\nto remain small in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Referring to those years,\nPeter Bergmann once said to me, 'You only had to know what your six best friends\nwere doing and you would know what was happening in general relativity.' Stud-\nies of cosmological models and of special solutions to the Einstein equations con-\n*A brief history of cosmic distances is found in [W4].\n\u2022(\u2022The most detailed bibliography on relativity up to the beginning of 1924 was compiled by Lecat\n[L2]. A list of the principal papers on cosmology for the years 1917 to 1932 is found\nin[Rlj. There was also further research on the problem of motion (which had\ninterested Einstein since 1927), the question of if and how the equations of motion\nof a distribution of matter can be obtained as a consequence of the gravitational\nfield equations. By and large, throughout this period the advances due to general\nrelativity are perceived to be the 'three successes'\u2014the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury, the bending of light, and the red shift\u2014and a rationale for an\nexpanding universe.\nHowever, in the 1930s a new element was injected which briefly attracted\nattention, then stayed more or less quiescent for a quarter of a century, after which\ntime it became one of general relativity's main themes. As a result of discussions\nbetween Tolman and Oppenheimer and his co-workers, there appeared in 1939,\na pair of papers, one by Tolman on static solutions of Einstein's field equations\nfor fluid spheres [Tl] and one, directly following it, by Oppenheimer and George\nVolkoff entitled 'On massive neutron cores' [O2]. In this paper, the foundations\nare laid for a general relativistic theory of stellar structure.)**\nHalf a year later, the paper 'On continued gravitational attraction' by Oppenhei-\nmer and Hartland Snyder came out [O3].\nWhich brings us to the change in style of general relativity after Einstein's\ndeath.\n270 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nexclusively devoted to relativity theory and gravitation. Its purpose was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of relativity. It marked the beginning of a\nseries of international congresses on general relativity and gravitation: GR1 was\nheld in Chapel Hill, N. The\n\"relativity family\" was born then. The\nblack hole in Cygnus X-l dates from 1972. 29, 351 -546, 1957), GR2 (CNRS Report 1962),\nGR3 (Conference Internationale sur les Theories de la Gravitation, Gauthier-Villars, 1964) and\nGR7 [S3]. Some of the papers presented at the GR conferences after 1970 are found in the journal\nGeneral Relativity and Gravitation.\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 271\nulus for the vastly increased activity and the new directions in general relativity. Each of the next five sections is devoted to\na topic in general relativity in which Einstein himself was active after 1915. In the final section, I list those topics which in their\nentirety belong to the post-Einsteinian era. The Three Successes\nIn 1933 Einstein, speaking in Glasgow on the origins of the general theory of\nrelativity [E2], recalled some of his struggles, the 'errors in thinking which caused\nme two years of hard work before at last, in 1915,1 recognized them as such and\nreturned penitently to the Riemann curvature, which enabled me to find the rela-\ntion to the empirical facts of astronomy.'\nThe period 1914-15 had been a confusing two years, not only for Einstein but\nalso for those of his colleagues who had tried to follow his gyrations. For example,\nwhen in December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz, he referred to what we call\nthe theory of general relativity as 'the theory of November 25, 1915.' He asked if\nLorentz agreed with his own understanding that Einstein had now abandoned his\narguments of 1914 for the impossibility of writing the gravitational field equations\nin covariant form [E3]. Lorentz, aged 62, is calculating away in Haarlem, making\nmistakes, correcting them, finally understanding what Einstein has in mind. Einstein added, 'The series of my\npapers about gravitation is a chain of false steps [Irrwegen] which nevertheless by\nand by led to the goal. However, nature has unfortunately denied me the\ngift of being able to communicate, so that what I write is correct, to be sure, but\n272 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nalso thoroughly indigestible.\nLorentz's fatherly advice must have been one of the incentives that led Einstein\nto write his first synopsis of the new theory [E6].\nEinstein's paper of March 1916 concludes with a brief section on the three new\npredictions: the red shift, the bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury.\nCommenting on the status of experimental relativity in 1979, David Wilkinson\nremarked:\n[These] two early successes [\u2014the perihelion precession and the bending of\nlight\u2014were] followed by decades of painfully slow experimental progress.\n[W7]\nI refer the reader to Wilkinson's paper for further remarks on the technological\nand sociological aspects of modern relativity experiments. For a summary of the\npresent status of the experimental verification of general relativity (excluding cos-\nmology), the reader should consult the report by Irwin Shapiro wherein it will be\nfound that, within the errors, all is well with the red shift (both astronomically\nand terrestrially), with the bending of light, with the precession of the perihelia\nof Mercury and other bodies, and also with the modern refined tests of the equiv-\n*This article was published both in the Annalen der Physik and, also in 1916, as a separate booklet\n[E7] which went through numerous printings and was also translated into English [E8].\n** On the Special and the General Relativity Theory, a Popular Exposition. In another modern review, the current situation is sum-\nmarized as follows:\nSo far [general relativity] has withstood every confrontation, but new confron-\ntations, in new arenas, are on the horizon. Whether general relativity survives\nis a matter of speculation for some, pious hope for some, and supreme confi-\ndence for others. [W8]\nWith fervent good wishes and with high hopes for further experiments with rock-\nets, satellites, and planetary probes, I hereby leave the subject of the comparison\nbetween theory and experiment in general relativity. In 1930 he wrote, 'I do not consider the main significance\nof the general theory of relativity to be the prediction of some tiny observable\neffects, but rather the simplicity of its foundations and its consistency' [E10]. Again in 1930 he expressed the opinion that\nthe idea of general relativity 'is a purely formal point of view and not a definite\nhypothesis about nature. In 1932 he went further: 'In\nmy opinion this theory [general relativity] possesses little inner probability.\nThus we see Einstein move from the joy of successfully confronting experimen-\ntal fact to higher abstraction and finally to that discontent with his own achieve-\nments which accompanied his search for a unified field theory.\nGeneral relativity does predict new tiny effects of a conventional kind, however. Eddington\n274 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nknew already that one may obtain two pointlike images of the far star if the align-\nment is imperfect [E12a]. In any event, to Mandl's delight [M5] Einstein went\non to publish a calculation of the dependence of the image intensity upon the\ndisplacement of the observer from the extended line of centers of the two stars\n[E12b]. The last three articles of this set deal\nwith general relativity. the theory of relativity and its connection\nwith his old ideas of the Erlangen program brought the last flare-up of his math-\nematical interests and mathematical production' [W9].) One of those three, com-\npleted in 1918, is entitled 'On the Differential Laws for the Conservation of\nMomentum and Energy in the Einstein Theory of Gravitation' [K2].\nTHE NEW DYNAMICS 275\nphysics of Einstein's relativity principle' [H6].) As for Einstein, in 1914 [E13]\nand again on November 4, 1915, [E14] he had derived the field equations of grav-\nitation from a variational principle\u2014but in neither case did he have the correct\nfield equations.\nThe conservation laws are the one issue on which Einstein's synopsis of March\n1916 [E6] is weak.\nIn October 1916 Einstein came back to energy-momentum conservation [E16].**\nThis time he gave a general proof (free of coordinate conditions) that for any\nmatter Lagrangian L the energy-momentum tensor T1\" satisfies\nas a consequence of the gravitational field equations.2), properly used in the case of general relativity, gives rise\nto eight rather than four identities, four for / = L and four for / = R.\n**An English translation of this paper is included in the well-known collection of papers by Einstein,\nLorentz, Minkowksi, and Weyl [S7].\n276 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nRicci in 1889, and then, again independently, in 1902 by Klein's former pupil\nLuigi Bianchi. In 1920, Eddington wrote in his book Space, Time\nand Gravitation, 'I doubt whether anyone has performed the laborious task of\nverifying these identities by straightforward algebra' [El7].\nLet us return to Einstein's article of October 1916. He noted that since the curvature\nscalar R is linear in the second derivatives of the g^, one can uniquely define a\nquantity R* which depends only on the g^ and their first derivatives by means\nof the relation\nNext define an object tff by\nWith the help of the gravitational field equations, it can be shown that Eq.\nThese results are of particular interest in that they show how Einstein was both\nundaunted by and quite at home with Riemannian geometry, which he handled\nwith ingenuity. I can almost hear him say, 'General\nrelativity is right.' I regard it as no\naccident that in his October 1916 paper Einstein took the route from Eq.\n278 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe discovery of Eq.9 marks the beginning of a new chapter in general\nrelativity. During the next two years, this question was discussed by\nFelix Klein, Levi-Civita, Lorentz, Pauli, Schroedinger, and others,* as well as by\nEinstein himself, who in 1918 came back to this issue one more time. Gravitational Waves\nAt no time during GR9 did I sense more strongly how much general relativity\nbelongs to the future than when I listened to the plenary lectures by Kip Thorne\nfrom Pasadena and Vladimir Braginsky from Moscow on the present state of\nexperiments designed to detect gravitational waves. In addition, it may well be that gravitational waves\nwill provide us with experimental criteria for distinguishing between the orthodox\nEinsteinian general relativity and some of its modern variants.\nDetailed accounts and literature referring to all these extraordinarily interesting\nand challenging aspects of gravitational wave physics are found in some of the\nbooks mentioned earlier in this chapter. All these papers\nreveal a developing interaction between astrophysics, particle physics, and general\nrelativity.\nEven before relativity, Lorentz had conjectured in 1900 that gravitation 'can be\nattributed to actions which do not propagate with a velocity larger than that of\nlight' [L6]. The term gravitational wave (onde gravifique) appeared for the first\ntime in 1905, when Poincare discussed the extension of Lorentz invariance to\ngravitation [P6]. In June 1916, Einstein became the first to cast these qualitative\nideas into explicit form [E20]. For the source-free case, he showed that\nthe quantities\nsatisfy (D is the Dalembertian)\n28O RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nin a coordinate system for which the 'gauge condition'\nholds true (Eq.\nIn the same June 1916 paper, Einstein also attempted to calculate the amount\nof gravitational radiation emitted by an excited isolated mechanical system with\nlinear dimensions R.\nAfter 1918 Einstein returned one more time to gravitational waves.\n*Einstein's result was off by a factor of 2. In 1937, Einstein briefly\nthought that gravitational waves do not exist (see Chapter 29). In the closing months\nof 1980, there appeared in the literature 'a contribution to the debate concerning\nthe validity of Einstein's quadrupole formula' [W16].\nThe difficulties in answering the above questions stem, of course, from the non-\nlinear nature of gravitation, an aspect not incorporated in Einstein's linearized\napproximation.*\nFinally, as a gift from the heavens, there comes to us the binary pulsar\nPSR1913 + 16, 'the first known system in which relativistic gravity can be used\nas a practical tool for the determination of astrophysical parameters' [W17]. This\nsystem offers the possibility of testing whether the quantitative general relativistic\nprediction of a change in period due to energy loss arising from gravitational quad-\nrupole radiation holds true.\n282 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7. Einstein and Mach. Einstein was in the middle of preparing his first synopsis\non general relativity when in February 1916 word reached him that the sufferings\nof Mach had come to an end.* Initially, Mach seems to have looked with favor on relativity, for Einstein\nwrote to him, again in 1909, 'I am very pleased that you enjoy the relativity theory'\n[E30]. In the obituary, Einstein cited extensively Mach's famous critique of New-\nton's concepts of absolute space and absolute motion and concluded, 'The cited\nplaces show that Mach clearly recognized the weak sides of classical mechanics\nand that he was not far from demanding a general theory of relativity, and that\nnearly half a century ago.** Einstein had Mach's discussion of rotational motion in mind\nwhen he wrote his own 1916 synopsis: its second section, entitled 'On the Grounds\nWhich Make Plausible an Extension of the [Special] Relativity Postulate,' begins\nwith the phrase:\nClassical mechanics, and the special theory of relativity not less, suffer from an\nepistemological shortcoming [the preferred position of uniform translation over\nall other types of relative motion] which was probably emphasized for the first\ntime by Mach. [E6]\nIn 1910, Mach had expressed himself positively about the work of Lorentz,\nEinstein, and Minkowski [M8]. Around January 1913, Einstein had written to\nhim how pleased he was with Mach's 'friendly interest which you manifest for\n*Four letters from Einstein to Mach have been preserved, none from Mach to Einstein. In February 1916, Einstein gave a lecture\non the Foucault pendulum [E31]., the Einstein-Grossmann] theory' [E32].] was a consequence of\nan absorption capacity diminished by age, since the whole direction of thinking of\nthis theory is in concordance with that of Mach, so that it is justified to consider\nMach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity,' he wrote in 1930 [E33].\nFirst, Mach's emphasis on the relativity of all motion.'\n**In his autobiographical sketch, Einstein mentioned that the critical reasoning required for his\ndiscovery of special relativity was decisively furthered by his reading of Mach's philosophical writ-\nings [E27].\n284 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nThe third theme, Mach's conjecture on the dynamic origins of inertia, leads us\nto Einstein's work on cosmology. Einstein and Mach 's Principle.\nSoon after Einstein arrived in Prague and broke his long silence on gravitation,\nhe published a short note entitled 'Does There Exist a Gravitational Action Anal-\nogous to the Electrodynamical Induction Effect. In his\nVienna lecture given in the fall of 1913, Einstein referred again to Mach's view\nof inertia and named it 'the hypothesis of the relativity of inertia' [E39]. He men-\ntioned neither this hypothesis nor the problem of inertia in any of his subsequent\narticles until February 1917, when he submitted a paper [E40] which once again\nmarks the beginning of a new chapter in physics: general relativistic cosmology. again perpetrated something about gravitation\ntheory which somewhat exposes me to the danger of being confined in a madhouse'\n[E41]. It must have taken him\na relatively long time to formulate this theory, since already in September 1916\nde Sitter mentions a conversation with Einstein about the possibility 'of an entirely\nmaterial origin of inertia' and the implementation of this idea in terms of 'a world\nwhich of necessity must be finite' [SI2].\nEinstein's paper is no doubt motivated by Machian ideas.17 is replaced by\n \n*For details and references to cosmology in the nineteenth century, see especially [P7] and [N6].17)286 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n(a proposal which again has nineteenth century origins), where p is a uniform\ndensity, then the solution\n0==_l\nis dynamically acceptable. In 1917 no\nlarge-scale galactic motions were yet known to exist. There are three\nmain points in Einstein's paper. First, he performs the very same transition in\ngeneral relativity, that is, he replaces\n \nby\n(15.21 that resolves the conundrum of the\nNewtonian infinite. Third, he proposes a dynamic realization of the relativity of\ninertia. His solution, the Einsteinian universe, had to be abolished in later years.\nEinstein had applied Eq. First, the old problem of the Newtonian infinite remains.' Thus Einstein began to give concrete form to\nMach's ideas: since the g^ determine the inertial action, they should, in turn, be\ncompletely determined by the mass distribution in the universe.\nSo strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in\n1918 he stated as being on equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory\ntheory of gravitation should rest [E42]:\n1. The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance\n2. I conclude with a brief chronology of his subsequent involvement with\ncosmology.\n1919. Thus electromagnetism constrains gravitation. This idea\nmay be considered Einstein's first attempt at a unified field theory.22)288 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\n7922. This leads Einstein to write to Weyl, 'If there is no quasi-\nstatic world, then away with the cosmological term' [E47]. Referring to the theoretical work by Friedmann, 'which was not influ-\nenced by experimental facts' and the experimental discoveries of Hubble, 'which\nthe general theory of relativity can account for in an unforced way, namely, with-\nout a A term' Einstein formally abandons the cosmological term, which is 'theo-\nretically unsatisfactory anyway' [E48].\nIn the post-Einsteinian era of revitalized interest in general relativity, it has\nbecome an important topic of research. I am told that the Zeitschrift fur Physik no longer accepts\npapers on general relativity on the grounds that articles on Mach's principle pro-\nvoke too many polemical replies. Singularities; the Problem of Motion\nIn 1917 Einstein wrote to Weyl, 'The question whether the electron is to be\ntreated as a singular point, whether true singularities are at all admissible in the\nphysical description, is of great interest. Unfor-\ntunately, I do not know how Einstein reacted to that paper. [E55]\nThat is the clearest expression I know of Einstein's profound belief in a descrip-\ntion of the world exclusively in terms of everywhere-continuous fields.\n290 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEORY\nof recent years to explain the elementary particles of nature by means of contin-\nuous fields have failed. These phrases are found in a paper, prepared with Jacob Grommer,\nin which Einstein made his first contribution to the problem of motion. In other words, was\nthe separate postulate of geodesic motion, already introduced by Einstein in 1914,\nunnecessary. Einstein and Grommer showed that this is indeed true for the case\nof a weak external gravitational field.\nA few weeks later, Weyl wrote to Einstein, thanking him for the opportunity\nto see the galley proofs of his new paper and 'for the support [this paper] gives to\nmy old idea about matter' [W20], adding a reference to an article he had written\nin 1922 [W21] in which similar conclusions had been reached. Indeed, as was\ndiscussed in particular by Havas [HI2],* Einstein was one of the independent\noriginators of the problem of motion, but neither the only nor the first one.\nEinstein's last important contribution to general relativity deals again with the\nproblem of motion. It is the work done with Leopold Infeld and Banesh Hoffmann\n\"Havas's paper, which also contains a simple derivation of the Einstein-Grommer result, is one of\nseveral important articles on the problem of motion in modern guise found in a volume edited by J. In these papers, the gravitational\nfield is no longer treated as external.\nIn his report to GR9 on the problem of motion, Ehlers stressed the difficulties\nof defining isolated systems in general relativity and the need not to treat the prob-\nlem of motion as an isolated question.** Current experimental results (notably the huge precession of the per-\niastron of PSR 1913 + 16) and future terrestrial and planetary experiments were\ndiscussed, with refined tests of general relativity in mind. There were reports\non the fundamental advances of our understanding regarding the general structure\nof relativity theory, with special reference to singularity theorems, black holes, and\ncosmic censorship.\n292 RELATIVITY, THE GENERAL THEOR\non asymmetries in the universe.

In the previous chapter, Einstein's role\nin the further development of this theory and its impact on later generations of\nphysicists were discussed. In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin.\nAs was mentioned before, in December 1915 Einstein wrote to his friend Besso\nthat he was 'zufrieden aber ziemlich kaputt,' satisfied but rather worn out [El]. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 301\nMileva remained in Zurich for the rest of her life. Perhaps the most remark-\nable characteristic of this period of illness is the absence of any lull in Einstein's\nscientific activity. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN.\nLet us briefly recapitulate Einstein's progress in understanding the bending of\nlight. He\nis still too close to Newton, who believed that space is flat and who could have\nhimself computed the 0*87 (now called the Newton value) from his law of grav-\nitation and his corpuscular theory of light. The member of the Prussian Acad-\nemy discovers that general relativity implies a bending of light by the sun equal\nto 1 \"74, the Einstein value, twice the Newton value. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].\nEddington' [01].f Lorentz cabled Einstein, whose excite-\n*For many details about all these early efforts, see especially [E32].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 305\nment on receiving this news after seven years of waiting will now be clearer.

An article by Alexander Moszkowski entitled 'Die Sonne bracht' es an den Tag' in\nthe Berliner Tageblatt of October 8, 1919, must presumably have been based on information from\nEinstein himself.\nThe greatest possible interest had been\naroused in scientific circles by the hope that\nrival theories of a fundamental physical\nproblem would bo put to the test, and there was\na very large attendance of astronomers and\nphysicists.\nKven the President of tho Royal Society, in\nstating that they had just listened to \" one of\nthe most momentous, if not the most moment-\nous, pronouncements of human thought,\" had\nto confess that no one had yet succeeded in\nstating in clear language what the theory of\nEinstein really was.' However, the weekly\nBerliner Illustrierte Zeitung of December 14 carried a picture of Einstein on its\ncover with the caption 'A new great in world history: Albert Einstein, whose\nresearches, signifying a complete revolution in our concepts of nature, are on a\npar with the insights of a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton.\nEinstein himself accepted 'with joy and gratefulness' the invitation to write a\nguest article in the London Times of November 28, for this gave him an oppor-\ntunity for communication 'after the lamentable breach in the former international\nrelations existing among men of science.' Referring to an earlier\ndescription of him in the London Times, he concluded his article as follows: 'By\nan application of the theory of relativity to the tastes of readers, today in Germany\nI am called a German man of science and in England I am represented as a Swiss\nJew.' The same Times issue carried an editorial reply, 'Dr Einstein pays\na well-intended if somewhat superfluous compliment to the impartiality of\nEnglish science,' to Einstein's first remark, followed by the comments, 'We con-\ncede him his little jest. But we note that, in accordance with the general tenor of\nhis theory, Dr Einstein does not supply any absolute description of himself\" in\nreply to his second remark. The best description I know of Einstein in 1919 is the\nphotograph on the cover of the Berliner Illustrirte, a picture of an intelligent,\nsensitive, and sensuous man who is deeply weary\u2014from the strains of intense\nthinking during the past years, from illnesses from which he has barely recovered,\nfrom the pain of watching his dying mother, and, I would think, from the com-\nmotion of which he was the center (See Plate II).\nNovember 1919 was not the first time Einstein and relativity appeared in the\nnews. In 1914 Einstein himself had\nwritten a newspaper article on relativity for Die Vossische Zeitung [E38]. For\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 309\nexample, The New York Times Index contains no mention of him until November\n9, 1919. From that day until his death, not one single year passed without his\nname appearing in that paper, often in relation to science, more often in relation\nto other issues. Thus the birth of the Einstein legend can be pinpointed at Novem-\nber 7, 1919, when the London Times broke the news. more probable, however, that this often-quoted statement indeed origi-\nnated with Einstein himself and was made sometime in 1916, when he published\na pamphlet (with Earth in Leipzig) and a 'popular' book on relativity (with\nVieweg in Braunschweig). At any rate, when in December 1919 a Times corre-\nspondent interviewed him at his home and asked for an account of his work that\nwould be accessible to more than twelve people, 'the doctor laughed good-\nnaturedly but still insisted on the difficulty of making himself understood by lay-\nmen' [N5].'

In the previous chapter, Einstein's role\nin the further development of this theory and its impact on later generations of\nphysicists were discussed. In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin. To begin with, I retur\nto the days just after November 1915, when Einstein completed his work on the\nfoundations of general relativity.\nAs was mentioned before, in December 1915 Einstein wrote to his friend Besso\nthat he was 'zufrieden aber ziemlich kaputt,' satisfied but rather worn out [El]. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI]. Einstein's reply shows that his indisposition was\nnot a trivial matter. 1899).\nBy that time, Albert and Elsa had decided to get married, and therefore Einstein\nhad to institute procedures to obtain a divorce from Mileva [E15]. Perhaps the most remark-\nable characteristic of this period of illness is the absence of any lull in Einstein's\nscientific activity.*\nOn various occasions, Einstein would utter asides which expressed his reser-\nvations on the bliss attendant on the holy state of matrimony.\nIt was not the only time that Einstein wrote about his family with more frankness\nthan grace [E21]. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN. Einstein Canonized\nIn the early fall of 1919, when Pauline Einstein was in the sanatorium, she\nreceived a postcard from her son which began, 'Dear Mother, joyous news today.

This factor of 2 sets the stag\nfor a confrontation between Newton and Einstein.\nIn 1914, before Einstein had the right answer, he had written to Besso with\ntypical confidence. Frustration continued also after\nNovember 18, 1915, the day on which Einstein announced the right bending of\n1''74 [E30]. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].\nEnglish interest in the bending of light developed soon after copies of Einstein's\ngeneral relativity papers were sent from Holland by de Sitter to Arthur Stanley\nEddington at Cambridge (presumably these were the first papers on the theory to\nreach England).f Lorentz cabled Einstein, whose excite-\n*For many details about all these early efforts, see especially [E32].

Elsewhere Einstein wrote of Maxwell, 'Imagine his feelings when the dif-\nferential equations he had formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields\nspread in the form of polarized waves and with the speed of light.'

It is my\nimpression that, after 1916, Einstein finally had some energy to spare for the\nworld in which he lived. Letters (not in the Princeton Archives) written by Einstein in\nthe early 1920s, showing that for several years he had a strong attachment to a\nyounger woman, express emotions for which, perhaps, he had no energy to spare\nin his marriages.

In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin.\nAs was mentioned before, in December 1915 Einstein wrote to his friend Besso\nthat he was 'zufrieden aber ziemlich kaputt,' satisfied but rather worn out [El]. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI]. Einstein's reply shows that his indisposition was\nnot a trivial matter.\nAt that stage Elsa Einstein Lowenthal took matters in hand.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 301\nMileva remained in Zurich for the rest of her life. On\noccasional visits to his children, Einstein would stay in her home. Perhaps the most remark-\nable characteristic of this period of illness is the absence of any lull in Einstein's\nscientific activity.*\nOn various occasions, Einstein would utter asides which expressed his reser-\nvations on the bliss attendant on the holy state of matrimony. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN.\nLet us briefly recapitulate Einstein's progress in understanding the bending of\nlight. He\nis still too close to Newton, who believed that space is flat and who could have\nhimself computed the 0*87 (now called the Newton value) from his law of grav-\nitation and his corpuscular theory of light.\nIn 1914, before Einstein had the right answer, he had written to Besso with\ntypical confidence. Frustration continued also after\nNovember 18, 1915, the day on which Einstein announced the right bending of\n1''74 [E30]. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].

Then\ncame November 6, 1919, the day on which Einstein was canonized.f\nEver since 1905 Einstein had been beatus, having performed two first-class mir-\nacles.\nDyson, speaking first, concluded his remarks with the statement, 'After a careful\nstudy of the plates I am prepared to say that they confirm Einstein's prediction., in the chair, having been petitioned\ninstanter, instantius, instantissime, pronounced the canonization: 'This is the most\nimportant result obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation since New-\nton's day, and it is fitting that it should be announced at a meeting of the Society\nso closely connected with him.' A few weeks later he added, 'The deflection of light by matter,\nsuggested by Newton in the first of his Queries, would itself be a result of first-\nrate scientific importance; it is of still greater importance when its magnitude sup-\nports the law of gravity put forward by Einstein' [Tl].\n306 THE LATER JOURNEY\nOn October 22, Carl Stumpf, a psychologist and fellow member of the Prussian\nAcademy, wrote to Einstein, 'I feel compelled to send you most cordial congratu-\nlations on the occasion of the grandiose new success of your gravitation theory.* On November 3 Einstein replied, 'On my return\nfrom Holland I find your congratulations. On November 7, 1919, the Einstein legend\nbegan. The next day, the\nsame paper published a further article on the same subject headlined 'The revo-\nlution in science/Einstein v. Newton/Views of eminent physicists,' in which we\nread, 'The subject was a lively topic of conversation in the House of Commons\nyesterday, and Sir Joseph Larmor, F. It is evident that Einstein's little book \"About the\nSpecial and General Theory of Relativity in Plain Terms\" did not find its way\ninto England during wartime. An article by Alexander Moszkowski entitled 'Die Sonne bracht' es an den Tag' in\nthe Berliner Tageblatt of October 8, 1919, must presumably have been based on information from\nEinstein himself.\nThe greatest possible interest had been\naroused in scientific circles by the hope that\nrival theories of a fundamental physical\nproblem would bo put to the test, and there was\na very large attendance of astronomers and\nphysicists. Tt was generally accepted that the\nobservations were derisive in the verifying of\nthe prediction of the famous physicist, Einstein,\nstated by the President of the Royal Society\nas being tho most remarkable scientific event\nsiiico the discovery of the predicted existence\nof the planet Neptune.\nKven the President of tho Royal Society, in\nstating that they had just listened to \" one of\nthe most momentous, if not the most moment-\nous, pronouncements of human thought,\" had\nto confess that no one had yet succeeded in\nstating in clear language what the theory of\nEinstein really was. It, was accepted, how\never, that Einstein, on tho bawls of hU theory,\nhad made three predictions. A column by Freundlich in Die Vossische Zeitung (Berlin) of November 30\nbegins as follows: 'In Germany a scientific event of extraordinary significance has\nnot yet found the reaction which its importance deserves.' However, the weekly\nBerliner Illustrierte Zeitung of December 14 carried a picture of Einstein on its\ncover with the caption 'A new great in world history: Albert Einstein, whose\nresearches, signifying a complete revolution in our concepts of nature, are on a\npar with the insights of a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton.\nEinstein himself accepted 'with joy and gratefulness' the invitation to write a\nguest article in the London Times of November 28, for this gave him an oppor-\ntunity for communication 'after the lamentable breach in the former international\nrelations existing among men of science.' Referring to an earlier\ndescription of him in the London Times, he concluded his article as follows: 'By\nan application of the theory of relativity to the tastes of readers, today in Germany\nI am called a German man of science and in England I am represented as a Swiss\nJew.' The same Times issue carried an editorial reply, 'Dr Einstein pays\na well-intended if somewhat superfluous compliment to the impartiality of\nEnglish science,' to Einstein's first remark, followed by the comments, 'We con-\ncede him his little jest. But we note that, in accordance with the general tenor of\nhis theory, Dr Einstein does not supply any absolute description of himself\" in\nreply to his second remark. The best description I know of Einstein in 1919 is the\nphotograph on the cover of the Berliner Illustrirte, a picture of an intelligent,\nsensitive, and sensuous man who is deeply weary\u2014from the strains of intense\nthinking during the past years, from illnesses from which he has barely recovered,\nfrom the pain of watching his dying mother, and, I would think, from the com-\nmotion of which he was the center (See Plate II).\nNovember 1919 was not the first time Einstein and relativity appeared in the\nnews. Frank recalls having seen in 1912 a Viennese newspaper with the headlines\n'The minute in danger, a sensation of mathematical science' [F2], obviously a\nreference to the time dilation of special relativity. In 1914 Einstein himself had\nwritten a newspaper article on relativity for Die Vossische Zeitung [E38]. For\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 309\nexample, The New York Times Index contains no mention of him until November\n9, 1919. From that day until his death, not one single year passed without his\nname appearing in that paper, often in relation to science, more often in relation\nto other issues. Thus the birth of the Einstein legend can be pinpointed at Novem-\nber 7, 1919, when the London Times broke the news. more probable, however, that this often-quoted statement indeed origi-\nnated with Einstein himself and was made sometime in 1916, when he published\na pamphlet (with Earth in Leipzig) and a 'popular' book on relativity (with\nVieweg in Braunschweig). At any rate, when in December 1919 a Times corre-\nspondent interviewed him at his home and asked for an account of his work that\nwould be accessible to more than twelve people, 'the doctor laughed good-\nnaturedly but still insisted on the difficulty of making himself understood by lay-\nmen' [N5].' November 18: the Times urges its readers not\nto be offended by the fact that only twelve people can understand the theory of\n'the suddenly famous Dr Einstein.' November 25: a news column with the head-\n31O THE LATER JOURNEY\nlines: 'A new physics based on Einstein/Sir Oliver Lodge says it will prevail, and\nmathematicians will have a terrible time.' November 29: A news item headlined 'Can't understand\nEinstein' reports that 'the London Times . When interviewed by the Times on\nrelativity theory, Charles Poor, professor of celestial mechanics at Columbia Uni-\nversity, said, 'For some years past, the entire world has been in a state of unrest,\nmental as well as physical.\nIt would be a misunderstanding of the Einstein phenomenon to attribute these\nvarious reactions to a brief and intense shock of the new.\nThe worldwide character of the legend is well illustrated by reports to the For-\neign Office from German diplomats stationed in countries visited by Einstein [Kl].\nOslo, June 1920: '[Einstein's] lectures were uncommonly well received by the\npublic and the press.' Copenhagen, June 1920: 'In recent days, papers of all opin-\nions have emphasized in long articles and interviews the significance of Professor\nEinstein, \"the most famous physicist of the present. An eyewitness described the mood of the public when Einstein gave\na lecture in a large concert hall in Vienna that same year.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 311\nSo it was, and so it remained everywhere and at all times during Einstein's life. Compare, for example, the case of Einstein with the one and\nonly earlier instance in which a major discovery in physics had created a world-\nwide sensation under the influence of newspapers.\nThe essence of Einstein's unique position goes deeper and has everything to do,\nit seems to me, with the stars and with language. A new man appears abruptly,\nthe 'suddenly famous Doctor Einstein.\nIn the late years, when I knew him, fame and publicity were a source of amuse-\nment and sometimes of irritation to Einstein, whose tribe revered no saints. As I try to\nfind the best way to characterize Einstein's deeper response to adulation, I am\nreminded of words spoken by Lord Haldane when he introduced Einstein to an\naudience at King's College in London on June 13, 1921.' Then he went on to describe Einstein in these words:\nA man distinguished by his desire, if possible, to efface himself and yet impelled\nby the unmistakable power of genius which would not allow the individual of\nwhom it had taken possession to rest for one moment. Einstein's was no exception.\nIn the first instance, Einstein's role within the establishment was dictated by\nhis obligations, many of them administrative, to science. Freundlich caused Einstein and others a certain amount of trouble [K4].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 313\nresearch institute only after Einstein left Germany. On October 27,\n1920, Einstein began his new position with an inaugural address on aether and\nrelativity theory.\nEinstein's physics of the 1920s was not only an exercise in administration and\nthe holding of professorships, however. But above everything else his prime interest remained with the questions of\nprinciple in physics. First some\nremarks on Einstein's other activities during the Berlin period. The list of known pacifists appended to\nthe letter included Einstein's name [K5]. After the war, Einstein the outspoken\nsupranationalist became a figure detested by the growing number of German\nchauvinists. By aether Einstein\nmeant the gravitational field (one may wonder if this new name was felicitously chosen).\nEinstein's active interest in the fate of the Jews also began in the Berlin period. I am sure that Einstein's strongest source of\n\"Their influx was particularly noticeable in Berlin.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 315\nidentity, after science, was to be a Jew, increasingly so as the years went by.\nThere was one person who more than anyone else contributed to Einstein's\nawakening: Kurt Blumenfeld, from 1910 to 1914 secretary general of the Exec-\nutive of World Zionist Organizations, which then had its seat in Berlin, and from\n1924 to 1933 president of the Union of German Zionists. It was Blumenfeld whom Einstein often entrusted in\nlater years with the preparation of statements in his name on Zionist issues. After having convinced Einstein, he wrote to Weizmann, 'As\nyou know, Einstein is no Zionist, and I beg you not to make any attempt to prevail\non him to join our organization. that you expect Einstein to give\nspeeches. Einstein .* As to his relations with Weizmann,\nEinstein once said to me, 'Meine Beziehungen zu dem Weizmann waren, wie der\nFreud sagt, ambivalent.'**\nThe extraordinary complexity of Einstein's life in the 1920s begins to unfold,\nthe changes in midlife are becoming clear.\nOn February 12, 1920, disturbances broke out in the course of a lecture given\nby Einstein at the University of Berlin. In a statement to the press,\nEinstein noted that there was a certain hostility directed against him which was\n*Part of this letter (dated incorrectly) is reproduced in [B3J.\nf See especially the events surrounding the awarding of the Nobel prize to Einstein, Chapter 30.* Einstein attended. Einstein and Lenard were present.\nIt would, of course, have been easy for Einstein to leave Germany and find an\nexcellent position elsewhere.\nInvited by the College de France, Einstein went to Paris in March 1922 to\ndiscuss his work with physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers. Germany did not enter the League\nuntil 1926, and so Einstein was once again in an exposed position. On June 24\nWalter Rathenau, who had been foreign minister of Germany for only a few\nmonths, a Jew and an acquaintance of Einstein's, was assassinated.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 317\nindividual [E48].*\nEvidently Einstein's life and moods were strongly affected by the strife and\nviolence in Germany in the early 1920s. There came a time when Einstein had to pay.\nNot long after his recovery, Einstein was on the road again.\n*In 1927, Einstein, Curie, and Lorentz prepared a report for the committee, dealing with an inter-\nnational bureau of meteorology [E52].\n:f This was principally the doing of Millikan, who since 1924 had been urging Einstein to spend part\nof his time in Pasadena [M3].\n3l8 THE LATER JOURNEY\nIn December 1932 the Einsteins left once again for California. Einstein was one of the guests invited for a\nlunch in his honor.' And, said Kessler, 'I had to explain to him who Einstein was; he had\nevidently never heard of him' [K12]. The more important of these contributions have been\nreprinted in various collections of Einstein essays.\nAfter 1920 Einstein wrote fairly often on scientific personalities.\nEinstein had a lifelong interest in philosophy. As I already remarked in Chapter 1, calling Einstein\na philosopher sheds as much light on him as calling him a musician.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 319\nEven though Einstein's interest in and impact on philosophy were strong, he\nhimself never wrote articles that may be called philosophical in a technical sense. When one of these referred to a pos-\nsible connection between Einstein's ideas and those of Kant, Einstein replied:\nIn regard to Kant's philosophy, I believe that every philosopher has his own\nKant.\nEinstein continued to consider philosophy ennobling in his later years.\nAmong the many contributions that show Einstein as a man of culture, I select\ntwo for brief additional comments.

The best description I know of Einstein in 1919 is the\nphotograph on the cover of the Berliner Illustrirte, a picture of an intelligent,\nsensitive, and sensuous man who is deeply weary\u2014from the strains of intense\nthinking during the past years, from illnesses from which he has barely recovered,\nfrom the pain of watching his dying mother, and, I would think, from the com-\nmotion of which he was the center (See Plate II).\nNovember 1919 was not the first time Einstein and relativity appeared in the\nnews. In 1914 Einstein himself had\nwritten a newspaper article on relativity for Die Vossische Zeitung [E38]. For\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 309\nexample, The New York Times Index contains no mention of him until November\n9, 1919. From that day until his death, not one single year passed without his\nname appearing in that paper, often in relation to science, more often in relation\nto other issues. Thus the birth of the Einstein legend can be pinpointed at Novem-\nber 7, 1919, when the London Times broke the news. more probable, however, that this often-quoted statement indeed origi-\nnated with Einstein himself and was made sometime in 1916, when he published\na pamphlet (with Earth in Leipzig) and a 'popular' book on relativity (with\nVieweg in Braunschweig). At any rate, when in December 1919 a Times corre-\nspondent interviewed him at his home and asked for an account of his work that\nwould be accessible to more than twelve people, 'the doctor laughed good-\nnaturedly but still insisted on the difficulty of making himself understood by lay-\nmen' [N5].'

After the war, Einstein the outspoken\nsupranationalist became a figure detested by the growing number of German\nchauvinists.

I am sure that Einstein's strongest source of\n\"Their influx was particularly noticeable in Berlin.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 315\nidentity, after science, was to be a Jew, increasingly so as the years went by.\nThere was one person who more than anyone else contributed to Einstein's\nawakening: Kurt Blumenfeld, from 1910 to 1914 secretary general of the Exec-\nutive of World Zionist Organizations, which then had its seat in Berlin, and from\n1924 to 1933 president of the Union of German Zionists. In a beautiful essay, Blumen-\nfeld has written of his discussions with Einstein in 1919, of his efforts 'to try to\nget out of a man what is hidden in him, and never to try to instill in a man what\nis not in his nature' [B3]. It was Blumenfeld whom Einstein often entrusted in\nlater years with the preparation of statements in his name on Zionist issues. It\nwas also Blumenfeld who was able to convince Einstein that he ought to join\nWeizmann on a visit to the United States (April 2-May 30, 1921) in order to\nraise funds for the planned Hebrew University. After having convinced Einstein, he wrote to Weizmann, 'As\nyou know, Einstein is no Zionist, and I beg you not to make any attempt to prevail\non him to join our organization. that you expect Einstein to give\nspeeches. Einstein .* As to his relations with Weizmann,\nEinstein once said to me, 'Meine Beziehungen zu dem Weizmann waren, wie der\nFreud sagt, ambivalent.'**\nThe extraordinary complexity of Einstein's life in the 1920s begins to unfold,\nthe changes in midlife are becoming clear.\nOn February 12, 1920, disturbances broke out in the course of a lecture given\nby Einstein at the University of Berlin. In a statement to the press,\nEinstein noted that there was a certain hostility directed against him which was\n*Part of this letter (dated incorrectly) is reproduced in [B3J.\nf See especially the events surrounding the awarding of the Nobel prize to Einstein, Chapter 30.* Einstein attended. Nevertheless,\nEinstein's article is a distinctly weak piece of writing, out of style with anything\nelse he ever allowed to be printed under his name. Einstein and Lenard were present.\nIt would, of course, have been easy for Einstein to leave Germany and find an\nexcellent position elsewhere.\nInvited by the College de France, Einstein went to Paris in March 1922 to\ndiscuss his work with physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers. Germany did not enter the League\nuntil 1926, and so Einstein was once again in an exposed position. On June 24\nWalter Rathenau, who had been foreign minister of Germany for only a few\nmonths, a Jew and an acquaintance of Einstein's, was assassinated.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 317\nindividual [E48].*\nEvidently Einstein's life and moods were strongly affected by the strife and\nviolence in Germany in the early 1920s. There came a time when Einstein had to pay.\nNot long after his recovery, Einstein was on the road again.\n*In 1927, Einstein, Curie, and Lorentz prepared a report for the committee, dealing with an inter-\nnational bureau of meteorology [E52]. Einstein's final resignation from the committee came in April\n1932 [D2].\n:f This was principally the doing of Millikan, who since 1924 had been urging Einstein to spend part\nof his time in Pasadena [M3].\n3l8 THE LATER JOURNEY\nIn December 1932 the Einsteins left once again for California. Einstein was one of the guests invited for a\nlunch in his honor.' And, said Kessler, 'I had to explain to him who Einstein was; he had\nevidently never heard of him' [K12]. From 1916 to 1920\nwe find the early eulogies\u2014to Mach, Schwarzschild, Smoluchowski, Leo Arons\u2014\nand a few more reviews of others' work\u2014of Lorentz's Paris lectures [E54], of\nHelmholtz's lectures on Goethe [E55], of Weyl's book on relativity [E56]. The more important of these contributions have been\nreprinted in various collections of Einstein essays.\nAfter 1920 Einstein wrote fairly often on scientific personalities. He was, of\ncourse, an obvious candidate for contributions commemorating Kepler [E57],\nNewton [E57a], and Maxwell [E58]. He wrote tributes [E62] to\nEhrenfest, Marie Curie, Nernst, Langevin, and Planck; also to Julius [E63],\nEdison [E64], Michelson [E65], and Noether [E66]. As I have mentioned\nbefore, these portraits show Einstein's keen perception of people and thereby con-\ntribute to a composite portrait of Einstein himself.\nEinstein had a lifelong interest in philosophy. As I already remarked in Chapter 1, calling Einstein\na philosopher sheds as much light on him as calling him a musician.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 319\nEven though Einstein's interest in and impact on philosophy were strong, he\nhimself never wrote articles that may be called philosophical in a technical sense. When one of these referred to a pos-\nsible connection between Einstein's ideas and those of Kant, Einstein replied:\nIn regard to Kant's philosophy, I believe that every philosopher has his own\nKant.\nEinstein continued to consider philosophy ennobling in his later years.\nAmong the many contributions that show Einstein as a man of culture, I select\ntwo for brief additional comments.' Elsewhere Einstein wrote of Maxwell, 'Imagine his feelings when the dif-\nferential equations he had formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields\nspread in the form of polarized waves and with the speed of light.

With the formulation of the field equations of grav-\n32O THE LATER JOURNEY\nitation in November 1915, classical physics (that is, nonquantum physics) reached\nits perfection and Einstein's scientific career its high point. Despite much illness, his years\nfrom 1916 to 1920 were productive and fruitful, both in relativity and in quantum\ntheory.\nWho can gauge the extent to which the restlessness of Einstein's life in the\n1920s was the cause or the effect of a lessening of creative powers. It is my\nimpression that, after 1916, Einstein finally had some energy to spare for the\nworld in which he lived. Letters (not in the Princeton Archives) written by Einstein in\nthe early 1920s, showing that for several years he had a strong attachment to a\nyounger woman, express emotions for which, perhaps, he had no energy to spare\nin his marriages. That line was written only\nmonths before the discovery of quantum mechanics, the time at which a younger\ngeneration of physicists took over the lead while Einstein went his own way.\nI return to Einstein's physics. I deal with Einstein's work on unified field\ntheory first, since it is a direct outgrowth of general relativity, the last scientific\ntopic treated before the present long digression on the suddenly famous Doctor\nEinstein. Then I turn to Einstein and the quantum theory, begining once again\nwith events in the year 1905 and continuing from there until his final days.

In the previous chapter, Einstein's role\nin the further development of this theory and its impact on later generations of\nphysicists were discussed. In this chapter, I turn to the impact of general relativity\non the world at large, an impact that led to the abrupt emergence of Einstein as\na charismatic figure and a focus of awe, reverence, and hatred. I also continue the\nstory, begun in Section 14a, of Einstein's years in Berlin. To begin with, I retur\nto the days just after November 1915, when Einstein completed his work on the\nfoundations of general relativity.\nAs was mentioned before, in December 1915 Einstein wrote to his friend Besso\nthat he was 'zufrieden aber ziemlich kaputt,' satisfied but rather worn out [El]. In 1916 he wrote ten scientific papers, includin\nhis first major survey of general relativity, his theory of spontaneous and induced\nemission, his first paper on gravitational waves, articles on the energy-momentum\nconservation laws and on the Schwarzschild solution, and a new proposal for mea-\nsuring the Einstein-de Haas effect. He also completed his first semipopular book\non relativity.\nI do not know precisely when this period began, but in February 1917 Einstein\nwrote to Ehrenfest that he would not be able to visit Holland because of a liver\nailment that had forced him to observe a severe diet and to lead a very quiet life\n[E2]. That quiet life did not prevent him from writing the founding paper on\ngeneral relativistic cosmology in that same month. Lorentz expressed regret that\nEinstein could not come; however, he wrote, 'After the strenuous work of recent\nyears, you deserve a rest' [LI]. Einstein's reply shows that his indisposition was\nnot a trivial matter.\nBy that time, Albert and Elsa had decided to get married, and therefore Einstein\nhad to institute procedures to obtain a divorce from Mileva [E15]. Perhaps the most remark-\nable characteristic of this period of illness is the absence of any lull in Einstein's\nscientific activity.*\nOn various occasions, Einstein would utter asides which expressed his reser-\nvations on the bliss attendant on the holy state of matrimony.\nIt was not the only time that Einstein wrote about his family with more frankness\nthan grace [E21].\nIn March 1955, shortly after the death of his lifelong friend Michele Besso,\nEinstein wrote to the Besso family, 'What I most admired in him as a human\nbeing is the fact that he managed to live for many years not only in peace but also\nin lasting harmony with a woman\u2014an undertaking in which I twice failed rather\ndisgracefully' [E22]. She was bedded down in Einstein's study.\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN. Soon\nthereafter, Einstein wrote to Zangger, 'My mother has died. Einstein Canonized\nIn the early fall of 1919, when Pauline Einstein was in the sanatorium, she\nreceived a postcard from her son which began, 'Dear Mother, joyous news today. The telegram that had\nannounced the news to Einstein a few days earlier read, 'Eddington found star\ndisplacement at the sun's edge preliminary between nine-tenth second and double\nthat.\nLet us briefly recapitulate Einstein's progress in understanding the bending of\nlight.

The member of the Prussian Acad-\nemy discovers that general relativity implies a bending of light by the sun equal\nto 1 \"74, the Einstein value, twice the Newton value. This factor of 2 sets the stag\nfor a confrontation between Newton and Einstein.\nIn 1914, before Einstein had the right answer, he had written to Besso with\ntypical confidence. Frustration continued also after\nNovember 18, 1915, the day on which Einstein announced the right bending of\n1''74 [E30]. Ten days later, commenting on a new idea by Freundlich for mea-\nsuring light bending, Einstein wrote to Sommerfeld, 'Only the intrigues of mis-\nerable people prevent the execution of this last, new, important test of the theory,'\nand, most uncharacteristically, signed his letter 'Your infuriated Einstein,' [E31].\nEnglish interest in the bending of light developed soon after copies of Einstein's\ngeneral relativity papers were sent from Holland by de Sitter to Arthur Stanley\nEddington at Cambridge (presumably these were the first papers on the theory to\nreach England). In addition, de Sitter's beautiful essay on the subject, published\nin June 1916 in the Observatory [S2], as well as his three important papers in the\nMonthly Notices [S3] further helped to spread the word. Before departing, Eddington wrote,\n'The present eclipse expeditions may for the first time demonstrate the weight of\nlight [i., the Newton value]; or they may confirm Einstein's weird theory of non-\nEuclidean space; or they may lead to a result of yet more far-reaching conse-\nquences\u2014no deflection' [E35].f Lorentz cabled Einstein, whose excite-\n*For many details about all these early efforts, see especially [E32]. Then\ncame November 6, 1919, the day on which Einstein was canonized.f\nEver since 1905 Einstein had been beatus, having performed two first-class mir-\nacles.\nDyson, speaking first, concluded his remarks with the statement, 'After a careful\nstudy of the plates I am prepared to say that they confirm Einstein's prediction.\nA very definite result has been obtained, that light is deflected in accordance with\nEinstein's law of gravitation.'\nPointing to the portrait of Newton which hung in the meeting hall, Silberstein\nadmonished the congregation: 'We owe it to that great man to proceed very care-\nfully in modifying or retouching his Law of Gravitation.\n306 THE LATER JOURNEY\nOn October 22, Carl Stumpf, a psychologist and fellow member of the Prussian\nAcademy, wrote to Einstein, 'I feel compelled to send you most cordial congratu-\nlations on the occasion of the grandiose new success of your gravitation theory.* On November 3 Einstein replied, 'On my return\nfrom Holland I find your congratulations. On November 7, 1919, the Einstein legend\nbegan. The next day, the\nsame paper published a further article on the same subject headlined 'The revo-\nlution in science/Einstein v. Newton/Views of eminent physicists,' in which we\nread, 'The subject was a lively topic of conversation in the House of Commons\nyesterday, and Sir Joseph Larmor, F. Daily papers invited emi-\nnent physicists to comment. It is evident that Einstein's little book \"About the\nSpecial and General Theory of Relativity in Plain Terms\" did not find its way\ninto England during wartime. An article by Alexander Moszkowski entitled 'Die Sonne bracht' es an den Tag' in\nthe Berliner Tageblatt of October 8, 1919, must presumably have been based on information from\nEinstein himself.\nNEWTONIAN IDEAS\nOVERTHROWN.\nThe greatest possible interest had been\naroused in scientific circles by the hope that\nrival theories of a fundamental physical\nproblem would bo put to the test, and there was\na very large attendance of astronomers and\nphysicists.\nKven the President of tho Royal Society, in\nstating that they had just listened to \" one of\nthe most momentous, if not the most moment-\nous, pronouncements of human thought,\" had\nto confess that no one had yet succeeded in\nstating in clear language what the theory of\nEinstein really was. It, was accepted, how\never, that Einstein, on tho bawls of hU theory,\nhad made three predictions. confident that the Einstein theory\nmust now be reckoned with, and that our con-\nceptions of the fabric of the universe must be\nfundamentally altered\nAt this stage Sir Oliver Lodge, whose con-\ntribution to the discussion had been eagerly\nexpected, left the meeting.' However, the weekly\nBerliner Illustrierte Zeitung of December 14 carried a picture of Einstein on its\ncover with the caption 'A new great in world history: Albert Einstein, whose\nresearches, signifying a complete revolution in our concepts of nature, are on a\npar with the insights of a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton.' As far as I know,\nthe first news in the Swiss papers is found in the Neue Zuricher Zeitung of\nDecember 10, where it is reported that the astronomer Henri Deslandres gave an\naccount of the May 29 observations before the December 8 session of the French\nAcademy of Sciences in which he summarized Einstein's theory by saying that\nenergy attracts energy.\nEinstein himself accepted 'with joy and gratefulness' the invitation to write a\nguest article in the London Times of November 28, for this gave him an oppor-\ntunity for communication 'after the lamentable breach in the former international\nrelations existing among men of science.' Referring to an earlier\ndescription of him in the London Times, he concluded his article as follows: 'By\nan application of the theory of relativity to the tastes of readers, today in Germany\nI am called a German man of science and in England I am represented as a Swiss\nJew.' The same Times issue carried an editorial reply, 'Dr Einstein pays\na well-intended if somewhat superfluous compliment to the impartiality of\nEnglish science,' to Einstein's first remark, followed by the comments, 'We con-\ncede him his little jest.

I am sure that Einstein's strongest source of\n\"Their influx was particularly noticeable in Berlin.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN 315\nidentity, after science, was to be a Jew, increasingly so as the years went by.\nThere was one person who more than anyone else contributed to Einstein's\nawakening: Kurt Blumenfeld, from 1910 to 1914 secretary general of the Exec-\nutive of World Zionist Organizations, which then had its seat in Berlin, and from\n1924 to 1933 president of the Union of German Zionists. In a beautiful essay, Blumen-\nfeld has written of his discussions with Einstein in 1919, of his efforts 'to try to\nget out of a man what is hidden in him, and never to try to instill in a man what\nis not in his nature' [B3]. It was Blumenfeld whom Einstein often entrusted in\nlater years with the preparation of statements in his name on Zionist issues. After having convinced Einstein, he wrote to Weizmann, 'As\nyou know, Einstein is no Zionist, and I beg you not to make any attempt to prevail\non him to join our organization. that you expect Einstein to give\nspeeches. Einstein .* As to his relations with Weizmann,\nEinstein once said to me, 'Meine Beziehungen zu dem Weizmann waren, wie der\nFreud sagt, ambivalent.'**\nThe extraordinary complexity of Einstein's life in the 1920s begins to unfold,\nthe changes in midlife are becoming clear.\nOn February 12, 1920, disturbances broke out in the course of a lecture given\nby Einstein at the University of Berlin. In a statement to the press,\nEinstein noted that there was a certain hostility directed against him which was\n*Part of this letter (dated incorrectly) is reproduced in [B3J.\nf See especially the events surrounding the awarding of the Nobel prize to Einstein, Chapter 30. On\nAugust 24, 1920, a newly founded organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft\ndeutscher Naturforscher, organized a meeting in Berlin's largest concert hall for\nthe purpose of criticizing the content of relativity theory and the alleged tasteless\npropaganda made for it by its author.* Einstein attended. Nevertheless,\nEinstein's article is a distinctly weak piece of writing, out of style with anything\nelse he ever allowed to be printed under his name. Einstein and Lenard were present.\nInvited by the College de France, Einstein went to Paris in March 1922 to\ndiscuss his work with physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers. Germany did not enter the League\nuntil 1926, and so Einstein was once again in an exposed position. On July 4\nEinstein wrote to Marie Curie that he must resign from the committee, since the\nmurder of Rathenau had made it clear to him that strong anti-Semitism did not\nmake him an appropriate member [E47]. A week later he wrote to her of his\nintention to give up his Akademie position and to settle somewhere as a private\nThis organization later published a book entitled 700 Autoren Gegen Einstein [12].\n'THE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 317\nindividual [E48].*\nEvidently Einstein's life and moods were strongly affected by the strife and\nviolence in Germany in the early 1920s. There came a time when Einstein had to pay.\nNot long after his recovery, Einstein was on the road again.\n*In 1927, Einstein, Curie, and Lorentz prepared a report for the committee, dealing with an inter-\nnational bureau of meteorology [E52]. Einstein's final resignation from the committee came in April\n1932 [D2].\n:f This was principally the doing of Millikan, who since 1924 had been urging Einstein to spend part\nof his time in Pasadena [M3].\n3l8 THE LATER JOURNEY\nIn December 1932 the Einsteins left once again for California. Einstein was one of the guests invited for a\nlunch in his honor. When Einstein came in Maillol observed, 'Une belle tele; c'est\nun poete.' And, said Kessler, 'I had to explain to him who Einstein was; he had\nevidently never heard of him' [K12]. All the papers Einstein published before finishing his\nwork on the formulation of general relativity deal either directly with research or\nwith reviews of research, with minor exceptions: a note in honor of Planck written\nin 1913 [E53] and reviews of booklets on relativity by Brill and by Lorentz\n[E53a]. From 1916 to 1920\nwe find the early eulogies\u2014to Mach, Schwarzschild, Smoluchowski, Leo Arons\u2014\nand a few more reviews of others' work\u2014of Lorentz's Paris lectures [E54], of\nHelmholtz's lectures on Goethe [E55], of Weyl's book on relativity [E56]. The more important of these contributions have been\nreprinted in various collections of Einstein essays.\nAfter 1920 Einstein wrote fairly often on scientific personalities. He was, of\ncourse, an obvious candidate for contributions commemorating Kepler [E57],\nNewton [E57a], and Maxwell [E58]. He wrote tributes [E62] to\nEhrenfest, Marie Curie, Nernst, Langevin, and Planck; also to Julius [E63],\nEdison [E64], Michelson [E65], and Noether [E66]. As I have mentioned\nbefore, these portraits show Einstein's keen perception of people and thereby con-\ntribute to a composite portrait of Einstein himself.\nEinstein had a lifelong interest in philosophy. As I already remarked in Chapter 1, calling Einstein\na philosopher sheds as much light on him as calling him a musician.\nTHE SUDDENLY FAMOUS DOCTOR EINSTEIN' 319\nEven though Einstein's interest in and impact on philosophy were strong, he\nhimself never wrote articles that may be called philosophical in a technical sense. When one of these referred to a pos-\nsible connection between Einstein's ideas and those of Kant, Einstein replied:\nIn regard to Kant's philosophy, I believe that every philosopher has his own\nKant. [E72]\nFrom Einstein's introduction to a new translation of Galileo's Dialogue [E73], we\nsee that he had read Plato. His philosophical interests are also manifest in his\nreview of Emile Meyerson's La Deduction Relativiste [E76] and his introductions\nto books by Planck [E77] and Frank [E78].\nEinstein continued to consider philosophy ennobling in his later years.\nAmong the many contributions that show Einstein as a man of culture, I select\ntwo for brief additional comments.' Elsewhere Einstein wrote of Maxwell, 'Imagine his feelings when the dif-\nferential equations he had formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields\nspread in the form of polarized waves and with the speed of light. With the formulation of the field equations of grav-\n32O THE LATER JOURNEY\nitation in November 1915, classical physics (that is, nonquantum physics) reached\nits perfection and Einstein's scientific career its high point. Despite much illness, his years\nfrom 1916 to 1920 were productive and fruitful, both in relativity and in quantum\ntheory.\nWho can gauge the extent to which the restlessness of Einstein's life in the\n1920s was the cause or the effect of a lessening of creative powers. It is my\nimpression that, after 1916, Einstein finally had some energy to spare for the\nworld in which he lived. Letters (not in the Princeton Archives) written by Einstein in\nthe early 1920s, showing that for several years he had a strong attachment to a\nyounger woman, express emotions for which, perhaps, he had no energy to spare\nin his marriages. That line was written only\nmonths before the discovery of quantum mechanics, the time at which a younger\ngeneration of physicists took over the lead while Einstein went his own way.\nI return to Einstein's physics. I deal with Einstein's work on unified field\ntheory first, since it is a direct outgrowth of general relativity, the last scientific\ntopic treated before the present long digression on the suddenly famous Doctor\nEinstein. Then I turn to Einstein and the quantum theory, begining once again\nwith events in the year 1905 and continuing from there until his final days.

His statement to Ehrenfest in 1920, 'I have\nmade no progress in general relativity theory. The electromagnetic field still stands\nthere in unconnected fashion' [E4], expressed both his disbelief in Weyl's theory\n(to be described in Section 17d) and his conviction that unification is a worthy\ncause.\nNor were his interests in physics in those years confined to general relativity,\nwhether of the orthodox or of the unified variety. His January 1922 paper on\nunified field theory, written with Grommer [E8], is never mentioned in these let-\nters, but a few weeks after its completion he wrote of his work with Grommer on\nquantum problems [E9].\nMeanwhile he was not altogether idle in regard to unified field theory. There\nis the Einstein-Grommer paper of 1922 in response to the Kaluza theory (see\nSection 17c). There are several papers in 1923 (to be discussed in Section 17e)\nelaborating an attempt at unification due to Eddington. But uni-\nfied field theory now becomes the main thrust of his efforts, along with the search\nfor an alternative that deprives quantum mechanics of its status as a fundamental\ntheory.\nHeisenberg's first paper on matrix mechanics [HI] and Einstein's first privately\ncreated unified field theory [E15] were both completed in July 1925; Schroedin-\nger's first paper on wave mechanics in January 1926 [SI]. Einstein's gestation\nperiod before he made the real plunge into unified field theory had lasted about a\ndecade, just as it had been for the special and the general theories of relativity. The two pioneers of unified field theory were both\nmathematicians. The first unification, based on a generalization of Riemannian\ngeometry in the usual four space-time dimensions, was proposed by Hermann\nWeyl in 1918 (see Section 17d).* His one paper on this subject was published\n*In 1914 Nordstrom had already proposed to use a five-dimensional space for the unification of\nelectromagnetism with a scalar gravitational field [Nl].\n330 THE LATER JOURNEY\nin 1921 [K2], but he already had this idea in 1919, for in April of that year\nEinstein wrote to him, 'The idea of achieving [a unified theory] by means of a\nfive-dimensional cylinder world never dawned on me.(5) is the unified Lagrangian\nfor gravitation and electromagnetism.6)UNIFIED FIELD THEORY 331\nKaluza proved his results only for the case where the fields are weak (i.

There were no puzzles such as the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment nor curious coincidences like the equality of the inertial and the grav-\nitational mass.\nThen it came to pass that physics veered toward a different course, neither led\nnor followed by Einstein. New particles were proposed\nand discovered. Amid all these developments, Einstein stayed with the unification\nof gravitation and electromagnetism, the final task he set himself. I\nturn next to an account of Einstein's own efforts at unification. The discussion of this second category is\npreceded by a brief excursion into post-Riemannian geometry and a comment on\nthe influence of Einstein's general relativity on mathematics. In this chapter, nothing\nfurther will be said on Einstein and quantum physics. However, in Chapter 26\nI shall return to his hopes for a new dynamics, based on a generalization of general\nrelativity, in which quantum mechanics would be explained rather than\npostulated. Another Decade of Gestation\nEinstein completed his first paper on unified field theory in January 1922.\nMuch had happened to him since the strenuous days of November 1915, when\nhe completed his general relativity theory. He had done his share of applying this\ntheory to the energy-momentum conservation problem, to gravitational waves,\nand to cosmology. He had introduced the A and B coefficients in quantum theory. His statement to Ehrenfest in 1920, 'I have\nmade no progress in general relativity theory. When he wrote to Weyl in 1922 about unified theories, 'I believe that in\norder to make real progress one must again ferret out some general principle from\nnature' [E5], he was still taking his cues from physics.\nNor were his interests in physics in those years confined to general relativity,\nwhether of the orthodox or of the unified variety.

Einstein's gestation\nperiod before he made the real plunge into unified field theory had lasted about a\ndecade, just as it had been for the special and the general theories of relativity.\nThis time, however, it was not he but others who in the end ushered in the new\nphysics.\nLet us see next what he did, first with five-dimensional theories. The two pioneers of unified field theory were both\nmathematicians. The first unification, based on a generalization of Riemannian\ngeometry in the usual four space-time dimensions, was proposed by Hermann\nWeyl in 1918 (see Section 17d). With the same aim in mind, and inspired by\nWeyl's paper, the mathematician and consummate linguist Theodor Kaluza\nbecame the first to suggest that unification might be achieved by extending space-\ntime to a five-dimensional manifold.* His one paper on this subject was published\n*In 1914 Nordstrom had already proposed to use a five-dimensional space for the unification of\nelectromagnetism with a scalar gravitational field [Nl].\n330 THE LATER JOURNEY\nin 1921 [K2], but he already had this idea in 1919, for in April of that year\nEinstein wrote to him, 'The idea of achieving [a unified theory] by means of a\nfive-dimensional cylinder world never dawned on me. Still very much in the Machian mood, Einstein\nadded that one ought to examine whether this new theory would allow for a sen-\nsible solution of the cosmological problem.\n*As was mentioned in Section 15e, Einstein had used the cosmological term in 1919 for the purpose\nof linking electromagnetism to gravitation [E17].\nGeorge Uhlenbeck told me, 'I remember that in the summer of 1926, when Oskar Klein told us\nof his ideas which would not only unify the Maxwell with the Einstein equations but also bring in\nthe quantum theory, I felt a kind of ecstasy.\nThus a length / enters the theory given by(17.14)\nUNIFIED FIELD THEORY 333\nworked for some years on the Kaluza-Klein theory. However, Einstein had\nalready become actively interested in Kaluza's ideas before the appearance of\nKlein's papers in 1926. Einstein and the Kaluza-Klein Theory. In 1922 Einstein and Grommer\naddressed the question, Does Eq. It was a question Einstein had pondered\nearlier in the context of conventional general relativity.\nPerhaps, he said, since the equations for pure gravitation are nonlinear. In what follows, we shall see that time and time again Einstein\nkept insisting on the existence of singularity-free solutions of source-free equations\nas a condition that must be met by a theory acceptable to him.\nEinstein's next papers on the five-dimensional theory are two short communi-\ncations in February 1927 [E19, E20]. Recall that in 1926 (in April, to be precise) Klein had presented\nan improved version of the Kaluza theory. In August 1926 Einstein wrote to\nEhrenfest that Grommer had drawn his attention to Klein's paper: 'Subject:\nKaluza, Schroedinger, general relativity' [E21]. Then come Einstein's own two papers just mentioned, followed\nby a letter to Lorentz: 'It appears that the union of gravitation and Maxwell's\ntheory is achieved in a completely satisfactory way by the five-dimensional theory\n(Kaluza-Klein-Fock)' [E23, Fl].\nThere is nothing unusual in Einstein's change of opinion about a theory being\nunnatural at one time and completely satisfactory some months later.\nEinstein then remained silent on the subject of five dimensions until 1931, when\nhe and Walther Mayer (see Chapter 29) presented a new formalism 'which is\npsychologically connected with the known theory of Kaluza but in which an exten-\nsion of the physical continuum to five dimensions is avoided' [E24]. After 1932 we find no trace of this theory in Einstein's work.\na) Soon after the Einstein-Mayer theory, another development in five-dimen-\nsional theory began, known as projective relativity, to which many authors con-\ntributed. Two ver-\nsions of the theory were considered. Bergmann informed me that he and Einstein also had worked\non this generalization [B3]. Einstein spent much less energy on five-dimensional theories\nthan on a second category of unification attempts in which the four-dimensional\nmanifold is retained but endowed with a geometry more general than Riemann's. If he is interested in what not only Einstein but also men like Edding-\nton and Schroedinger tried to do with these geometries, turn to the next section. Relativity and Post-Riemannian Differential Geometry\nIn his address on general relativity and differential geometry to the Einstein Cen-\ntennial Symposium in Princeton [C3], the eminent mathematician Shiing-Shen\n*In that paper, one will find references to other recent work in this direction.19)\nUNIFIED FIELD THEORY 337\nGhern made two statements which apply equally well to the present section: 'It\nis a strange feeling to speak on a topic of which I do not know half the title', and\n'I soon saw the extreme difficulty of his [Einstein's] problem and the difference\nbetween mathematics and physics. Chern deals mainly with modern global problems of dif-\nferential geometry, such as the theory of fiber bundles, subjects which Einstein\nhimself never wrote about or mentioned to me. My own aim is to give an account\nof unified field theory in Einstein's day, when the concerns were uniquely with\nlocal differential geometry and when the now somewhat old-fashioned (and glob-\nally inadequate) general Ricci calculus was the main tool. This remark is of importance for the\nWeyl and Eddington theories discussed in what follows.\nThe theory of connections took off in 1916, starting with a paper by the math-\nematician Gerhard Hessenberg [H2]. These new developments were entirely a\n340 THE LATER JOURNEY\nconsequence of the advent of general relativity, as is seen from persistent reference\nto that theory in all papers on connections which appeared in the following years,\nby authors like Weyl, Levi-Civita, Schouten, Struik, and especially Elie Cartan,\nwho introduced torsion in 1922 [C4], and whose memoir 'Sur les Varietes a Con-\nnexion Affine et la theorie de la Relativite Generalisee' [C5] is one of the papers\nwhich led to the modern theory of fiber bundles [C3]. Thus Einstein's labors had\na major impact on mathematics.\nLet us consider the Weyl theory of 1918 [W2] as an example of this formalism. His is not a unified theory if one\ndemands that there be a unique underlying Lagrangian L that forces the validity\nof the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations, since to any L one can\nadd an arbitrary multiple of the gauge-invariant scalar ^F^F^yg d*x. Einstein replied, 'Your ideas show a\nwonderful cohesion. Einstein was of course critical of the\nfact that the line element was no longer invariant. Some months later, he wrote to Einstein, '[Your criticism] very much\ndisturbs me, of course, since experience has shown that one can rely on your intu-\nition' [W4].\nThis theory did not live long. The Later Journey: a Scientific Chronology\nThe last period of Einstein's scientific activities was dominated throughout by\nunified field theory.\nThe most striking characteristics of his way of working in those years are not\nall that different from what they had been before: devotion to the voyage, enthu-\n*In 1921, Einstein wrote a not very interesting note in which he explored, in the spirit of Weyl, a\nrelativity theory in which only g^dx'dx' = 0 is invariant [E34].UNIFIED FIELD THEORY\n(17. Before I start with the chronology, I should stress that Einstein had three\ndistinct motives for studying generalizations of general relativity. First, he wanted\nto join gravity with electromagnetism. Second, he had been unsuccessful in obtain-\ning singularity-free solutions of the source-free general relativistic field equations\nwhich could represent particles; he hoped to have better luck with more general\ntheories.\n1922.\n1923.

In 1923 Weyl declared the theory not fit for discus-\nsion ('undiskutierbar') [W5], and Pauli wrote to Eddington, 'In contrast to you\nand Einstein, I consider the invention of the mathematicians that one can found a\ngeometry on an affine connection without a [primary] line element as for the pres-\nent of no significance for physics' [P6].\nEinstein's own initial reaction was that Eddington had created a beautiful\nframework without content [E40].* Thus, romantically,\nbegan Einstein's adventures with general connections, adventures that were to\ncontinue until his final hours.\nEinstein set himself the task of answering a question not fully treated by\nEddington: what are the field equations for the forty fundamental FjJ, that take\nthe place of the ten field equations for the g^ in general relativity. In addition, there was the old\nlament: 'The theory .\nIn 1925 Einstein referred to these two objections at the conclusion to an appen-\ndix for the German edition of Eddington's book on relativity. 'Unfortunately, for\nme the result of this consideration consists in the impression that the Weyl-\nEddington [theories] are unable to bring progress in physical knowledge' [E43].

Einstein himself realized soon after the publication of\nthis work that the results were not impressive. In the first one, he wrote, 'I have once again a theory of gravitation-\nelectricity; very beautiful but dubious' [E45]. In a paper written in 1927 he remarked, 'As a result\nof numerous failures, I have now arrived at the conviction that this road [ Weyl\n\u2014\u00bb Eddington -* Einstein] does not bring us closer to the truth' [E48]. Einstein's work was done independently of Cartan, who was the first\nto introduce nonsymmetric connections (the antisymmetric parts of the Fj, are now\ncommonly known as Cartan torsion coefficients). There is considerable interest by\ngeneral relativists in theories of this kind, called Einstein-Cartan theories [H3].

On January 11,\n1929, he issued a brief statement to the press stating that 'the purpose of this work\nis to write the laws of the fields of gravitation and electromagnetism under a\nunified view point' and referred to a six-page paper he had submitted the day\nbefore [E52]. 'The length of this work\u2014written at the rate of half a page a\nyear\u2014is considered prodigious when it is considered that the original presentation\nof his theory of relativity [on November 25, 1915] filled only three pages' [N3].\n'Einstein is amazed at stir over theory. The 'Special Features' section of the Sunday edition of\nThe New York Times of February 3, 1929, carried a full-page article by Einstein\non the early developments in relativity, ending with remarks on distant parallelism\nin which his no doubt bewildered readers were told that in this geometry paral-\nlelograms do not close.

Pauli on the\nother hand, was scathing in a review of this subject written in 1932: '[Einstein's]\nnever-failing inventiveness as well as his tenacious energy in the pursuit of [uni-\nfication] guarantees us in recent years, on the average, one theory per annum.\nIt is psychologically interesting that for some time the current theory is usually\nconsidered by its author to be the \"definitive solution\" ' [P8].\nEinstein held out awhile longer.\n1933.

The electromagnetic field still stands\nthere in unconnected fashion' [E4], expressed both his disbelief in Weyl's theory\n(to be described in Section 17d) and his conviction that unification is a worthy\ncause. His January 1922 paper on\nunified field theory, written with Grommer [E8], is never mentioned in these let-\nters, but a few weeks after its completion he wrote of his work with Grommer on\nquantum problems [E9].\nMeanwhile he was not altogether idle in regard to unified field theory. But uni-\nfied field theory now becomes the main thrust of his efforts, along with the search\nfor an alternative that deprives quantum mechanics of its status as a fundamental\ntheory.\nHeisenberg's first paper on matrix mechanics [HI] and Einstein's first privately\ncreated unified field theory [E15] were both completed in July 1925; Schroedin-\nger's first paper on wave mechanics in January 1926 [SI]. The two pioneers of unified field theory were both\nmathematicians. The first unification, based on a generalization of Riemannian\ngeometry in the usual four space-time dimensions, was proposed by Hermann\nWeyl in 1918 (see Section 17d).6)UNIFIED FIELD THEORY 331\nKaluza proved his results only for the case where the fields are weak (i.\nThus a length / enters the theory given by(17.14)\nUNIFIED FIELD THEORY 333\nworked for some years on the Kaluza-Klein theory. Einstein and Grommer [E8] showed that 'the Kaluza theory possesses\nno centrally symmetric solution which depends on the g^ only and which might\nbe interpreted as a (singularity-free) electron,' a conclusion which of course has\nnothing to do with unified field theory per se, since it could equally well have been\nasked in the context of ordinary general relativity theory.\nEinstein's next papers on the five-dimensional theory are two short communi-\ncations in February 1927 [E19, E20]. After 1932 we find no trace of this theory in Einstein's work.UNIFIED FIELD THEORY 335\ndiscussed in much detail in Bergmann's book (see also [B2] and [PI]). Two ver-\nsions of the theory were considered.

It was also known well before\n1906 that specific heats of gases exhibited even more curious properties.390 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEINSTEIN AND SPECIFIC HEATS 391\nIt became clear rather soon, however, that even for solid elements the Dulong-\nPetit rule is not as general as its propounders had thought.* Matters got more serious in 1840, when two Swiss\nphysicists, Auguste de la Rive and Francois Marcet, reported on studies of carbon. At almost the same time, diamond was also being studied by Henri Victor\nRegnault, who more than any other physicist contributed to the experimental\ninvestigations of specific heats in the nineteenth century.*\nIn 1872, not only Weber, but also a second physicist, made the conjecture that\nthe Dulong-Petit value c ~ 6 would be reached by carbon at high temperatures:\nJames Dewar. His work is included in a\ndetailed compilation by Alfred Wigand [W3] of the literature on the specific heats\nof solid elements that appeared in the same issue of the Annalen der Physik as\nEinstein's first paper on the quantum theory of specific heats. We are therefore\nup to date in regard to the experimental developments preceding Einstein's work. Einstein was the first one to state\nthis fact clearly. Even though this is a topic that does\nnot directly bear on Einstein's work in 1906, I believe it will be useful to complete\nthe nineteenth century picture with a brief explanation of why gases caused so\nmuch more aggravation. [M2]\nMaxwell's conundrum was the mystery of the missing vibrations. Einstein's work on specific heats [El] is above all\nimportant because it made clear for the first time that quantum concepts have a\nfar more general applicability. His 1906 paper is also unusual because here we\nmeet an Einstein who is quite prepared to use a model he knows to be approxi-\nmate in order to bring home a point of principle.\nEarlier in 1906 Einstein had come to accept Planck's relation (Eq.

In 1900 Planck discovered the blackbody radiation\nlaw without using light-quanta. In 1905 Einstein discovered light-quanta without\nusing Planck's law. Chapter 19 is devoted to the light-quantum hypothesis. This Chapter ends with a\ndetailed account of the reasons why the light-quantum paper drew such a negative\nresponse. In 1906 Einstein\ncompleted the first paper on quantum effects in the solid state. The light-quantum as originally defined was a parcel of\nenergy.\n(d) Einstein's work on quantum statistics is treated in Chapter 23, which also\nincludes a discussion of Bose's contribution.\nI shall continue the outline of Einstein's contributions to the quantum theory\nin Section 18c. Particle Physics: The First Fifty Years\nLet us leave aside the photon for a while and ask how physicists reacted to the\nexperimental discovery or the theoretical prediction (whichever came first) of other\nnew particles.\nThe discovery in 1897 of the first particle, the electron, was an unexpected\nexperimental development which brought to an end the ongoing debate about\nwhether cathode rays are molecular torrents or aetherial disturbances. Nevertheless, the existence of the electron was widely accepted within the\nspan of very few years. The discoveries of the free electron and of the Zeeman effect (in 1896)\ncombined made it evident that a universal atomic constituent had been discovered\nand that the excitations of electrons in atoms were somehow the sources of atomic\nspectra.\nThe discovery of the electron was a discovery at the outer experimental frontier.\n360 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIn the first instance, this finding led to the abandonment of the earlier qualitative\nconcept of the indivisibility of the atom, but it did not require, or at least not at\nonce, a modification of the established corpus of theoretical physics.\nDuring the next fifty years, three other particles entered the scene in ways not\nso dissimilar from the case of the electron, namely, via unexpected discoveries of\nan experimental nature at the outer frontier. (Prior to\nthe discovery of the muon, theorists had already speculated about the need for an\nextra particle to explain these anomalies. Within months after the public unveiling of\nthe neutrino hypothesis, the first theory of the weak interactions, which is still\nimmensely useful, was proposed. The meson hypothesis immediately led to con-\nsiderable theoretical activity as well.\nThen there was the positron, 'a new kind of particle, unknown to experimental\nphysics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron' [Dl]. In fact, twelve\nyears before its discovery, in one of his Bakerian lectures (1920) Rutherford spoke [R2] of 'the idea\nof the possible existence of an atom of mass one which has zero nuclear charge. During that period, one participant expressed fear for 'a new crisis in quan-\ntum physics'[Wl].\nAnd then there was the photon, the first particle to be predicted theoretically. The light-quan-\ntum hypothesis was considered somewhat of an aberration even by leading phys-\nicists who otherwise held Einstein in the highest esteem. The hypothesis seemed paradoxical:\nlight was known to consist of waves, hence it could not consist of particles.

Planck concluded from Eq. Now comes the\nquantum postulate. And that is how the quantum theory was born.\nFrom the point of view of physics in 1900 the logic of Planck's electromagnetic\nand thermodynamic steps was impeccable, but his statistical step was wild. As will be discussed in Section 19b, the classical\nequipartition theorem could have given him a quite definite method for determin-\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 37.

Planck had obtained Eq. Dur-\ning the 1890s, Planck had made several errors in reasoning before he arrived at\nhis radiation law, but none as astounding and of as great an historical significance\nas his fortunate failure to be the first to derive Eq.\nThus the experimentalists close to Planck were well aware of Rayleigh's work.\nIn July 1905 Rayleigh acknowledges Jeans' contribution [R6]. Of far greater interest is the role this equation played in the early\nreactions to the quantum theory. From 1900 to 1905, Planck's radiation formula\nwas generally considered to be neither more nor less than a successful represen-\ntation of the data (see [Bl]).

He was also on his way from statistical\nphysics to quantum physics.\nEinstein derived the above value for N in the light-quantum paper, completed\nin March 1905.\nWe now leave the classical part of the March paper and turn to its quantum\npart.\n376 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n19c. The Light-Quantum Hypothesis and the Heuristic Principle\nI mentioned in Chapter 3 that the March paper was Einstein's only contribution\nthat he himself called revolutionary.\nIn 1905, it was Einstein's position that Eq.17 agreed with existing theory but not\nwith experiment.20 and we have Einstein's\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 377\nLight-quantum hypothesis: Monochromatic radiation of low density [i.\nThis result, which reads like a theorem, was nevertheless a hypothesis since it\nwas based on Wien's guess, which itself still needed proof from first principles.\nThe genius of the light-quantum hypothesis lies in the intuition for choosing the\nright piece of experimental input and the right, utterly simple, theoretical ingre-\ndients.\nEinstein's introduction of light-quanta in the Wien regime is the first step\ntoward the concept of radiation as a Bose gas of photons. Just as was the case for\nPlanck's derivation of his radiation law, Einstein's derivation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis grew out of statistical mechanics. Since\n1925, we have known (thanks to Bose and especially to Einstein) that the photon\ngas obeys Bose statistics for all frequencies, that the statistical independence of\nenergy quanta is not true in general, and that the gas analogy which makes use\nof the Boltzmann statistics relation (Eq. The physicist of 1905 could take or leave the\nlight-quantum hypothesis as nothing more than a curious property of pure radia-\ntion in thermal equilibrium, without any physical consequence.\n378 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIn other words, the light-quantum hypothesis is an assertion about a quantum\nproperty of free electromagnetic radiation; the heuristic principle is an extension\nof these properties of light to the interaction between light and matter.\nI shall leave Einstein's applications of the heuristic principle to Section 19e and\nshall describe next how, in 1906, Einstein ceased assiduously avoiding Planck's\nequation (Eq.11) and embraced it as a new hypothesis.

Einstein had introduced a quantization related to p: the light-quantum hypoth-\nesis.11 is also valid in the quantum theory.11 even though its theoretical foundation had become a mystery\nwhen quantum effects are important.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. In 1905, however, the\nsubject was still in its infancy.\nIn 1905 the status of experimental techniques was still rudimentary in all these\nareas; yet in each of them initial discoveries of great importance had already been\nmade. Five experimental observations made within the span of one\ndecade largely shaped the physics of the twentieth century.\n380 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIt was not an electrostatic effect, since it made no qualitative difference whether\nthe interposed surface was a conductor or an insulator.\nThe earliest speculations on the nature of the effect predate the discovery of the\nelectron in 1897. He made the crucial discovery that the electron energy showed 'not the\nslightest dependence on the light intensity' [L5].\n1905: Einstein. However, soon thereafter\nJeans stated in his important survey of the theory of radiation [ J3] that 'there is\nalmost general agreement' that Eq.24)\n382 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nexperiments and a summary of his beautiful results: Eq. I turn next to a\nmore systematic review of the responses to the light-quantum idea. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next. That he may sometimes have\nmissed the target in his speculations, as, for example, in his hypothesis of light-\nquanta, cannot really be held too much against him, for it is not possible to intro-\nduce really new ideas even in the most exact sciences without sometimes taking a\nrisk' [K5]. His struggles with the quantum theory in general and\nwith the light-quantum hypothesis in particular are a recurring theme.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. This led him to approach quantum problems with great cau-\ntion in his writings\u2014a caution already evident in the way the title of his March\npaper was phrased. In the earliest years following his light-quantum proposal,\nEinstein had good reasons to regard it as provisional.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 383\nhe had used this law as an experimental fact without explaining it. He did\nthis very clearly in 1911, at the first Solvay congress, where he said, 'I insist on\nthe provisional character of this concept [light-quanta] which does not seem recon-\ncilable with the experimentally verified consequences of the wave theory' [El2].\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3].\nIt is my impression that the resistance to the light-quantum idea was so strong\nthat Einstein's caution was almost hopefully mistaken for vacillation. However,\njudging from his papers and letters, I find no evidence that he at any time with-\ndrew any of his statements made in 1905. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4].\nFirst, a general remark on the old quantum theory. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation. There, advances became possible only after the advent of quantum\nfield theory, when the concepts of particle creation and annihilation were formu-\nlated.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. In 1907 he wrote to\nEinstein:\nI am not seeking the meaning of the quantum of action [light-quanta] in the\nvacuum but rather in places where absorption and emission occur, and [I]\nassume that what happens in the vacuum is rigorously described by Maxwell's\nequations. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9].\nThus by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, many leading\ntheorists were prepared to accept the fact that the quantum theory was here to\nstay. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2].\nPhysicists\u2014good physicists\u2014enjoy scientific speculation in private but tend to\nfrown upon it when done in public. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein. His proximity to the first-rate experiments on blackbody radia-\ntion being performed at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin was\nbeyond doubt a crucial factor in his discovery of 1900 (though it would be very\nwrong to say that this was the only decisive factor).\nBohr's paper [B2] of April 1913 about the hydrogen atom was revolutionary\nand certainly not at once generally accepted. When told of the helium/hydrogen ratio, Einstein is\nreported to have said of Bohr's work, 'Then it is one of the greatest discoveries'\n[H6].\nTo be sure, he had mentioned a number of experimental consequences of his\nhypothesis in his 1905 paper.\nI have already mentioned that Millikan relished his result on the photoeffect\nbut declared that, even so, the light quantum theory 'seems untenable' [M5]. In\n386 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n1918, Rutherford commented on the Duane-Hunt results, 'There is at present no\nphysical explanation possible of this remarkable connection between energy and\nfrequency' [R7].\nTo summarize: the enormous resistance to light-quanta found its roots in the\nparticle-wave paradoxes. Einstein's own emphasis\non the provisional nature of the light-quantum hypothesis tended to strengthen\nthe reservations held by other physicists.\nRight after March 1905, Einstein sat down and wrote his doctoral thesis.\nHe did not return to the light-quantum until 1909. However, in 1906 he made\nanother important contribution to quantum physics, his theory of specific heats. We shall return to the light-quantum\nin Chapter 21.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 387\nE8.

His purpose for doing so was to apply\n402\nTHE PHOTON 403\nthis result to energy fluctuations of blackbody radiation in a frequency interval\nbetween v and v + dv.' His vision of light-quanta as particles is especially evident in a\nletter to Sommerfeld, also dating from 1909, in which he writes of 'the ordering\nof the energy of light around discrete points which move with light velocity' [E4].

Light-Quantum and Photon. A photon is a state of the electromagnetic field\nwith the following properties.\nThe number of photons is in general not conserved in particle reactions and\ndecays. I shall return to the nonconservation of photon number in Chapter 23, but\nwould like to note here an ironic twist of history. The term photon first appeared\nin the title of a paper written in 1926: 'The Conservation of Photons. The subject: a\nspeculation that light consists of 'a new kind of atom . propose the name photon' [L2]. In\n*There have been occasional speculations that the photon might have a tiny nonzero mass. Direct\nexperimental information on the photon mass is therefore a matter of interest. In what follows, the photon mass is taken to be strictly zero. Its subject was 'electrons et\nphotons. For this reason, in this section I make the distinction between\nlight-quantum ('E \u2014 hv only') and photon. It was via the analysis of statistical fluctuations of blackbody radiation\nthat Einstein eventually came to associate a definite momentum with a light-quan-\ntum. Einstein's first results bearing on the\nquestion of photon momentum are found in the two 1909 papers.\nTHE PHOTON 409\nThe parallels between Eqs.17 would lead Einstein to\nstate, in 1909, the 'momentum quantum postulate': monochromatic radiation of\nlow density behaves in regard to pressure fluctuations as if it consists of mutually\nindependent momentum quanta of magnitude hv/' c.\nWhat he did say was, 'If the radiation were to consist of very few extended\ncomplexes with energy hv which move independently through space and which\nare independently reflected\u2014a picture that represents the roughest visualization\nof the light-quantum hypothesis\u2014then as a consequence of fluctuations in the\nradiation pressure there would act on our plate only such momenta as are repre-\nsented by the first term of our formula [Eq.\nThe photon momentum made its explicit appearance in that same year, 1909. As an example, he mentioned Bremsstrahlung, for which he wrote\ndown the equation\nthe first occasion on record in which the photon enters explicitly into the law of\nmomentum conservation for an elementary process. Einstein himself did not explicitly intro-\nduce photon momentum until 1916, in the course of his studies on thermal equi-\nlibrium between electromagnetic radiation and a molecular gas [E10, Ell].16, he\nhad to invoke a condition of directedness: 'if a bundle of radiation causes a mole-\ncule to emit or absorb an energy amount hv, then a momentum hv/c is transferred\nto the molecule, directed along the bundle for absorption and opposite the bundle\nfor [induced] emission' [El 1]. Earliest Unbehagen about Chance\nEinstein prefaced his statement about photon momentum just quoted with the\nremark that this conclusion can be considered 'als ziemlich sicher erwiesen,' as\nfairly certainly proven.\nTHE PHOTON 411\nBesso about the needle rays, he wrote, 'Damit sind die Lichtquanten so gut wie\ngesichert' [E13].16): the needle ray picture\napplies not only to induced processes (as was mentioned above) but also to spon-\ntaneous emission.16] make it seem\nalmost inevitable to formulate a truly quantized theory of radiation. The Compton Effect\nI return to the photon story and come to its denouement. Even those opposed to quantized radiation might\nhave found these relations to their liking since (independent of any quantum\ndynamics) they yield at once significant differences from the classical theories of\nthe scattering of light by matter** and therefore provide simple tests of the photon\nidea. First, because photons were rejected out of\nhand by the vast majority of physicists, few may have felt compelled to ask for\ntests of an idea they did not believe to begin with.THE PHOTON 413\nit is not surprising that he would look for new ways in which the existence of\nphotons might lead to observable deviations from the classical picture. In fact, after\n1917 nothing particularly memorable happened in regard to light-quanta until\ncapital progress was achieved* when Arthur Compton [Cl] and Debye [D2]\nindependently derived the relativistic kinematics for the scattering of a photon off\nan electron at rest:\n(21.* The quality of the experiment is well demonstrated by the value\nhe obtained for the Compton wavelength: h/mc \u00ab 0. Compton concluded, 'The experimental support of the theory indicates\nvery convincingly that a radiation quantum carries with it directed momentum as\nwell as energy. Nevertheless, the photon idea was rapidly accepted. Sommerfeld\nincorporated the Compton effect in his new edition of Atombau und Spektrallinien\nwith the comment, 'It is probably the most important discovery which could have\nbeen made in the current state of physics' [S3]. A year after Compton's experiments, Einstein\nwrote a popular article for Berliner Tageblatt, which ends as follows: 'The posi-\ntive result of the Compton experiment proves that radiation behaves as if it con-\nsisted of discrete energy projectiles, not only in regard to energy transfer but also\nin regard to Stosswirkung (momentum transfer)' [E24].

From Kirchhoff to Planck\nIn the last four months of 1859, there occurred a number of events that were to\nchange the course of science. The response to Kirchhoff's\nchallenge led to the discovery of the quantum theory.\nConsider a body in thermal equilibrium with radiation. Let the radiation\nenergy which the body absorbs be converted to thermal energy only, not to any\nother energy form. Let E,dv denote the amount of energy emitted by the body per\nunit time per cm2 in the frequency interval dv. He also gave an operational definition for a system, the\n'Hohlraumstrahlung,' which acts as a perfect blackbody: 'Given a space enclosed\nby bodies of equal temperature, through which no radiation can penetrate, then\nevery bundle of radiation within this space is constituted, with respect to quality\nand intensity, as if it came from a completely black body of the same temperature. Experimentalists had to cope with three\nmain problems: (1) to construct manageable bodies with perfectly black properties,\n(2) to devise radiation detectors with adequate sensitivity, and (3) to find ways of\nextending the measurements over large frequency domains. A quarter of a century passed\nbefore the next theoretical advance in blackbody radiation came about.\nIn 1879 Josef Stefan conjectured on experimental grounds that the total energy\nradiated by a hot body varies with the fourth power of the absolute temperature\n[SI]. His proof again involved thermodynamics, but combined this time with a\nstill younger branch of theoretical physics: the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell.\nFor the case of Hohlraumstrahlung, the radiation is homogeneous, isotropic,\nand unpolarized, so that\none had come as far as possible on the basis of thermodynamics and general elec-\ntromagnetic theory. All these guesses may be forgotten except for one, Wien's exponential\nlaw, proposed in 1896 [W2]:(19.4)This law was the very first thermodynamic consequence derived from Maxwell's\ntheorem, according to which the numerical value of the radiation pressure equals\none third of the energy per unit volume. When in 1893 Wilhelm Wien proved his\ndisplacement law [Wll(19. For a brief period, it appeared that Wien's\nlaw was the final answer. The other was the persistence and vision of Planck. At the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt, at that\ntime probably the world's best-equipped physics laboratory, two teams were\nindependently at work on blackbody radiation experiments. The first of these,\nOtto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, had tackled the problem in an as yet unex-\nplored wavelength region, X = 12-18 /an (and T = 300-1650 K). By the middle of the\nnineteenth century, wavelengths had been measured up to X \u00ab 1. Progress\nwas slow in the next forty years, as demonstrated by a question raised by Samuel\nPierpont Langley in a lecture given in 1885 before the AAAS meeting in Ann\nArbor: 'Does [the] ultimate wavelength of 2. The first sentence of the first\npaper in the first issue of the Physical Review reads as follows: 'Within a few\nyears the study of obscure radiation has been greatly advanced by systematic\ninquiry into the laws of dispersion of the infrared rays.

The next candidate was\nPlanck, to whom the offer of extraordinarius (associate professor) was made.\nPlanck accepted and was soon promoted to full professor.\nPlanck most probably* discovered his law in the early evening of Sunday,\nOctober 7. Rubens and his wife had called on the Plancks on the afternoon of that\nday. In the course of the conversation, Rubens mentioned to Planck that he had\nfound p(v, 7) to be proportional to T for small v. Planck went to work after the\nvisitors left and found an interpolation between this result and Wien's law, Eq. Expressed in notations introduced by Planck\ntwo months later, he proposed that\nwhich is indeed correct in the quantum regime hv/kT 3> 1, a condition that is\nwell satisfied in Paschen's experiment mentioned earlier (hv/kT ~ 15 for T =\n1000 K and X = 1 /urn).\nIt would do grave injustice to Planck if I left the reader with the impression\nthat Planck's discovery was exclusively the result of interpolating experimental\ndata. For years, it had been his ambition to derive the correct radiation law from\nfirst principles. I must refrain from discussing Planck's\nearlier research (cf. However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life.\n*Here I rely on the obituary of Rubens by Gerhard Hettner [HI], himself an experimental expert\non blackbody radiation. Hettner's account differs slightly from the recollections that Planck himself\nwrote in his late eighties [P2].6 contains Wien's law of 1896:\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 369\nEven if Planck had stopped after October 19, he would forever be remembered\nas the discoverer of the radiation law. That made him the discoverer of\nthe quantum theory. This concerns a result Planck had obtained some\ntime earlier [P5]. Consider in par-\nticular the case in which the radiation damping due to the 'x term is very small,\nthat is, 7 <sC v, where 7 = Si^eV/Smc3. This\nyields\nThis equation for the joint equilibrium of matter and radiation, one of Planck's\nimportant contributions to classical physics, was the starting point for his discovery\nof the quantum theory. As we soon shall see, this same equation was also the point\nof departure for Einstein's critique in 1905 of Planck's reasoning and for his quan-\ntum theory of specific heats. Planck concluded from Eq. I should rather say, what Planck held to be a statistical\nstep.\nFrom the point of view of physics in 1900 the logic of Planck's electromagnetic\nand thermodynamic steps was impeccable, but his statistical step was wild.\nIn 1931 Planck referred to it as 'an act of desperation. In Planck's opin-\nion, 'the electromagnetic theory of radiation does not provide us with any starting\npoint whatever to speak of such a probability [ WN] in a definite sense' [PI].\nHowever, let us leave aside for the moment what Planck did not do or what he\nmight have done and return to his unorthodox handling of Boltzmann's principle.\nIn his papers, Planck alluded to the inspiration he had received from Boltzmann's\nstatistical methods. The corresponding\ncounting problem, discussed previously in Section 4b, has nothing to do with\nPlanck's counting of partitions of indistinguishable objects, the energy elements. Planck himself knew that and said so.\n[P7]**\nThus the only justification for Planck's two desperate acts was that they gave him\nwhat he wanted. It cast Planck, con-\nservative by inclination, into the role of a reluctant revolutionary. Although there have been other major innovations in\nphysics since December 1900, the world has not seen since a figure like Planck.\nFrom 1859 to 1926, blackbody radiation remained a problem at the frontier of\ntheoretical physics, first in thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the\nold quantum theory, and finally in quantum statistics. As Pringsheim put it in\na lecture given in 1903, 'Planck's equation is in such good agreement with exper-\niment that it can be considered, at least to high approximation, as the mathemat-\nical expression of Kirchhoff's function' [P8]. In 1901 Planck obtained from the available data the value\nh = 6. At the time of Planck's\n*In January 1905 and again in January 1906, Planck proposed Boltzmann for the Nobel prize.\n**The interesting suggestion has been made that Planck may have been led to Eq. Not until 1908, when the charge of the alpha\nparticle was found to be 9.3 X 10~10 [R3] was it realized how good Planck's value\nfor e was.\nFrom the very start, Planck's results were a source of inspiration and bewil-\nderment to Einstein. Addressing Planck in 1929, he said 'It is twenty-nine years\nago that I was inspired by his ingenious derivation of the radiation formula which\n. In 1913,\nEinstein wrote that Planck's work 'invigorates and at the same time makes so\ndifficult the physicist's existence.\nFrom my discussions with Einstein, I know that he venerated Planck as the\ndiscoverer of the quantum theory, that he deeply respected him as a human being\nwho stood firm under the inordinate sufferings of his personal life and of his coun-\ntry, and that he was grateful to him: 'You were the first to advocate the theory of\nrelativity' [El]. In 1918 he proposed Planck for the Nobel prize.* In 1948, after\nPlanck's death, Einstein wrote, 'This discovery [i., the quantum theory] set sci-\nence a fresh task: that of finding a new conceptual basis for all of physics. Nothing further\nhappened in quantum physics after 1901 until Einstein proposed the light-quan-\ntum hypothesis. Einstein on Planck: 1905.\nThe Rayleigh-Einstein-Jeans Law\nThe first sentence on the quantum theory published by Einstein was written in\nthe month of March, in the year 1905. It is the title of his first paper on light-\nquanta, 'On a heuristic point of view concerning the generation and conversion of\nlight' [E5, Al].' Later on, I shall mention the last sentence published by\nEinstein on scientific matters, also written in March, exactly one half-century\n\u2022See Chapter 30.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 373\nlater. Whatever one may think of the\nstatus of the quantum theory in 1955, in 1905 this opinion was, of course, entirely\njustified.\nIn the March paper, Einstein referred to Eq.6 as 'the Planck formula,\nwhich agrees with all experiments to date.' But what was the meaning of Planck's\nderivation of that equation. The\nMarch paper opens with a section entitled 'on a difficulty concerning the theory\nof blackbody radiation,' in which he put these imperfections in sharp focus. The first of these was the Planck equation (Eq.16)\nwhere R is the gas constant, N Avogadro's number, and R/N (= k) the Boltz-\nmann constant (for a number of years, Einstein did not use the symbol k in his\npapers).\nand went on to note that this classical relation is in disagreement with experiment\nand has the disastrous consequence that a = oo, where a is the Stefan-Boltzmann\nconstant given in Eq.\n'If Planck had drawn this conclusion, he would probably not have made his\ngreat discovery,' Einstein said later [E3]. Planck had obtained Eq. Dur-\ning the 1890s, Planck had made several errors in reasoning before he arrived at\nhis radiation law, but none as astounding and of as great an historical significance\nas his fortunate failure to be the first to derive Eq. This omission is no\ndoubt related to Planck's decidedly negative attitude (before 1900) towards Boltz-\nmann's ideas on statistical mechanics. It contains for the\nfirst time the suggestion to apply to radiation 'the Maxwell -Boltzmann doctrine\nof the partition of energy' (i.\nThus the experimentalists close to Planck were well aware of Rayleigh's work.\nOne wonders whether or not Planck himself knew of this important paper, which\nappeared half a year before he proposed his own law. Whichever may be the case,\nin 1900 Planck did not refer to Rayleigh's contribution.\nIn July 1905 Rayleigh acknowledges Jeans' contribution [R6].

The\nmiddle section of that paper is entitled 'On the meaning of the constant K in the\nkinetic atomic energy,' K being half the Boltzmann constant. In the final section,\n'Application to radiation,' he had discussed energy fluctuations of radiation near\nthermal equilibrium.

The Light-Quantum Hypothesis and the Heuristic Principle\nI mentioned in Chapter 3 that the March paper was Einstein's only contribution\nthat he himself called revolutionary.\nIn 1905, it was Einstein's position that Eq. He therefore set out to study blackbody radiation in a new way\n'which is not based on a picture of the generation and propagation of radiation'\u2014\nthat is, which does not make use of Planck's equation (Eq. He extracted the light-quantum postulate\nfrom an analogy between radiation in the Wien regime and a classical ideal gas\nof material particles.\nNow to the radiation problem.22)\nLet the radiation be contained in a volume v.20 and we have Einstein's\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 377\nLight-quantum hypothesis: Monochromatic radiation of low density [i.,\nwithin the domain of validity of the Wien radiation formula] behaves in ther-\nmodynamic respect as if it consists of mutually independent energy quanta of\nmagnitude Rftv/N (ft = h/k, R/N = k, Rftv/N = hv). That choice is less surprising\nif one recalls* that a year earlier the question of volume dependence had seemed\nquite important to him for the analysis of the energy fluctuations of radiation.\nEinstein's introduction of light-quanta in the Wien regime is the first step\ntoward the concept of radiation as a Bose gas of photons. Just as was the case for\nPlanck's derivation of his radiation law, Einstein's derivation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis grew out of statistical mechanics. Since\n1925, we have known (thanks to Bose and especially to Einstein) that the photon\ngas obeys Bose statistics for all frequencies, that the statistical independence of\nenergy quanta is not true in general, and that the gas analogy which makes use\nof the Boltzmann statistics relation (Eq. However,\ncall it genius, call it luck, in the Wien regime the counting according to Boltzmann\nand the counting according to Bose happen to give the same answer while non-\nconservation of photons effectively plays no role. The physicist of 1905 could take or leave the\nlight-quantum hypothesis as nothing more than a curious property of pure radia-\ntion in thermal equilibrium, without any physical consequence.\nThe heuristic principle: If, in regard to the volume dependence of the entropy,\nmonochromatic radiation (of sufficiently low density) behaves as a discrete\nmedium consisting of energy quanta of magnitude Rfiv/' N, then this suggests\nan inquiry as to whether the laws of the generation and conversion of light are\nalso constituted as if light were to consist of energy quanta of this kind.\n378 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIn other words, the light-quantum hypothesis is an assertion about a quantum\nproperty of free electromagnetic radiation; the heuristic principle is an extension\nof these properties of light to the interaction between light and matter.\nI shall leave Einstein's applications of the heuristic principle to Section 19e and\nshall describe next how, in 1906, Einstein ceased assiduously avoiding Planck's\nequation (Eq. Einstein on Planck: 1906\nIn 1906 Einstein returned once more to Planck's theory of 1900. Now he had\nmuch more positive things to say about Planck's radiation law. This change in\nattitude was due to his realization that 'Planck's theory makes implicit use of the\n. light-quantum hypothesis' [E8]. Einstein's reconsideration of Planck's reason-\ning and of its relation to his own work can be summarized in the following way:\n1. Planck had used the p- U relation, Eq. Planck had introduced a quantization related to U, namely, the prescription\nU = Phv/N(sce Eqs. Einstein had introduced a quantization related to p: the light-quantum hypoth-\nesis. He then re-examined the derivation of\nPlanck's law with the help of this new assumption. 'We must consider the following theorem to be the basis of\nPlanck's radiation theory: the energy of a [Planck oscillator] can take on only those\nvalues that are integral multiples of hv; in emission and absorption the energy of\na [Planck oscillator] changes by jumps which are multiples of hv.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions. We shall see in Section\n19f that Planck was not at all prepared to accept at once Einstein's reasoning,\ndespite the fact that it lent support to his own endeavors. As to Einstein himself,\nhis acceptance of Planck's Eq.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. The Photoelectric Effect: The Second Coming of h\nThe most widely remembered part of Einstein's March paper deals with his inter-\npretation of the photoelectric effect. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves. Hertz\nfound the photoeffect when he became intrigued by a side effect he had observed\nin the course of his investigations on the electromagnetic wave nature of light\n[H3]. He also came to the (not quite correct) conclusion that 'If the\nobserved phenomenon is indeed an action of light, then it is only one of ultraviolet\nlight. Stimulated by Hertz's work, Wilhelm Hallwachs showed\nnext that irradiation with ultraviolet light causes uncharged metallic bodies to\nacquire a positive charge [H4]. His conclusion:\n'The value of m/e in the case of ultraviolet light. He made the crucial discovery that the electron energy showed 'not the\nslightest dependence on the light intensity' [L5].\n1905: Einstein. Third, the value of the slope was predicted to be Planck's\nconstant determined from the radiation law.\nEinstein gave several other applications of his heuristic principle: (1) the fre-\nquency of light in photoluminescence cannot exceed the frequency of the incident\nlight (Stokes's rule) [E5]; (2) in photbionization, the energy of the emitted electron\ncannot exceed hv, where v is the incident light frequency [E5];* (3) in 1906, he\ndiscussed the application to the inverse photoeffect (the Volta effect) [E8]; (4) in\n1909, he treated the generation of secondary cathode rays by X-rays [Ell]; (5) in\n1911, he used the principle to predict the high-frequency limit in Bremsstrahlung\n[E12]. However, soon thereafter\nJeans stated in his important survey of the theory of radiation [ J3] that 'there is\nalmost general agreement' that Eq. A long paper published in 1916 gives the details of the\n*In 1912, Einstein [E10] noted that the heuristic principle could be applied not only to photonion-\nization but also in a quite similar way to photochemical processes.24)\n382 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nexperiments and a summary of his beautiful results: Eq.24 holds very well\nand 'Planck's h has been photoelectrically determined with a precision of about\n0.) Working with an X-ray tube operated at a constant potential V, they\nfound that the X-ray frequencies produced have a sharp upper limit v given by\neV = hv, as had been predicted by Einstein in 1906. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next. His struggles with the quantum theory in general and\nwith the light-quantum hypothesis in particular are a recurring theme.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. This led him to approach quantum problems with great cau-\ntion in his writings\u2014a caution already evident in the way the title of his March\npaper was phrased. In the earliest years following his light-quantum proposal,\nEinstein had good reasons to regard it as provisional. He could formulate it clearly\nonly in the domain hv/kT^>\\, where Wien's blackbody radiation law holds.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 383\nhe had used this law as an experimental fact without explaining it.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. the apparently complete success of the Einstein\nequation [for the photoeffect], the physical theory of which it was designed to be\nthe symbolic expression is found so untenable that Einstein himself, I believe, no\nlonger holds to it' [M4]. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Yet the resistance to Planck's ideas\u2014while cer-\ntainly not absent\u2014was much less pronounced and vehement than in the case of\nEinstein. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation. By and\nlarge, no comparable breakthroughs occurred in regard to the most difficult of all\nquestions concerning electromagnetic phenomena: the interaction between matter\nand radiation.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. He was unaware of the fact\nthat his proposal implied the need for a revision of the classical radiation field\nitself. His reasoning alleged to involve only a modification of the interaction\nbetween matter and radiation. Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nThis difference in assessment of the two theoretical issues, one raised by Planck,\none by Einstein, is quite evident in the writings of the leading theorists of the day.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. In 1907 he wrote to\nEinstein:\nI am not seeking the meaning of the quantum of action [light-quanta] in the\nvacuum but rather in places where absorption and emission occur, and [I]\nassume that what happens in the vacuum is rigorously described by Maxwell's\nequations. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9].\nThus by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, many leading\ntheorists were prepared to accept the fact that the quantum theory was here to\nstay. However, the Maxwell theory of the free radiation field, pure and simple,\nprovided neither room for modification (it seemed) nor a place to hide one's igno-\nrance, in contrast with the less transparent situation concerning the interaction\nbetween matter and radiation. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Yet the resistance to the\nideas of Planck and Bohr\u2014while certainly not absent\u2014was much less pro-\nnounced and vehement than in the case of Einstein. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. His proximity to the first-rate experiments on blackbody radia-\ntion being performed at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin was\nbeyond doubt a crucial factor in his discovery of 1900 (though it would be very\nwrong to say that this was the only decisive factor). In the first instance, experi-\nment also set the pace for the acceptance of the Planck formula. At\nthe same time, however, neither Einstein nor any one else denied the fact that\nPlanck's highly nontrivial universal curve admirably fitted the data. When told of the helium/hydrogen ratio, Einstein is\nreported to have said of Bohr's work, 'Then it is one of the greatest discoveries'\n[H6]. Unlike Bohr and Planck, Einstein had to wait a\ndecade before he saw one of his predictions, the linear E-v relation, vindicated,\nas was discussed in the previous section.\nI have already mentioned that Millikan relished his result on the photoeffect\nbut declared that, even so, the light quantum theory 'seems untenable' [M5]. In\n386 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n1918, Rutherford commented on the Duane-Hunt results, 'There is at present no\nphysical explanation possible of this remarkable connection between energy and\nfrequency' [R7]. The fact of the matter is that, even after Ein-\nstein's photoelectric law was accepted, almost no one but Einstein himself would\nhave anything to do with light-quanta.\nThis went on until the early 1920s, as is best illustrated by quoting the citation\nfor Einstein's Nobel prize in 1922: 'To Albert Einstein for his services to theoret-\nical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect'\n[A2].\nTo summarize: the enormous resistance to light-quanta found its roots in the\nparticle-wave paradoxes.\nRight after March 1905, Einstein sat down and wrote his doctoral thesis.\nHe did not return to the light-quantum until 1909. However, in 1906 he made\nanother important contribution to quantum physics, his theory of specific heats. Einstein, Forschungen undFortschritte 5, 248 (1929).\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 387\nE8.

Wien, Math.", "Planck_Radiation_Law_1905": " From Kirchhoff to Planck\nIn the last four months of 1859, there occurred a number of events that were to\nchange the course of science.\nConsider a body in thermal equilibrium with radiation. Let the radiation\nenergy which the body absorbs be converted to thermal energy only, not to any\nother energy form. Let E,dv denote the amount of energy emitted by the body per\nunit time per cm2 in the frequency interval dv. A quarter of a century passed\nbefore the next theoretical advance in blackbody radiation came about.\nIn 1879 Josef Stefan conjectured on experimental grounds that the total energy\nradiated by a hot body varies with the fourth power of the absolute temperature\n[SI]. The precise formulation was\ngiven in 1884, when Boltzmann (then a professsor of experimental physics in\nGraz) proved theoretically that the strict T4 law holds only for bodies which are\nblack.\nFor the case of Hohlraumstrahlung, the radiation is homogeneous, isotropic,\nand unpolarized, so that\none had come as far as possible on the basis of thermodynamics and general elec-\ntromagnetic theory. All these guesses may be forgotten except for one, Wien's exponential\nlaw, proposed in 1896 [W2]:(19.4)This law was the very first thermodynamic consequence derived from Maxwell's\ntheorem, according to which the numerical value of the radiation pressure equals\none third of the energy per unit volume. When in 1893 Wilhelm Wien proved his\ndisplacement law [Wll(19. In this case, the Stefan-Boltzmann law reads (V is the volume of the\ncavity)(19. For a brief period, it appeared that Wien's\nlaw was the final answer. The other was the persistence and vision of Planck. In February\n1900 they stated their conclusion: Wien's law fails in that region [LI]. By the middle of the\nnineteenth century, wavelengths had been measured up to X \u00ab 1. The first sentence of the first\npaper in the first issue of the Physical Review reads as follows: 'Within a few\nyears the study of obscure radiation has been greatly advanced by systematic\ninquiry into the laws of dispersion of the infrared rays. These experimental developments\nare of fundamental importance for our main subject, the quantum theory, since\nthey were crucial to the discovery of the blackbody radiation law.\n* There had been earlier indications of deviations from Wien's law, but these were not well\ndocumented.5)\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM367\nSample of the Rubens-Kurlbaum data which led Planck to guess his radiation formula\n[Rl].\nPlanck's formula is not yet plotted.

The next candidate was\nPlanck, to whom the offer of extraordinarius (associate professor) was made.\nPlanck accepted and was soon promoted to full professor.\nPlanck most probably* discovered his law in the early evening of Sunday,\nOctober 7. Rubens and his wife had called on the Plancks on the afternoon of that\nday. In the course of the conversation, Rubens mentioned to Planck that he had\nfound p(v, 7) to be proportional to T for small v. Planck went to work after the\nvisitors left and found an interpolation between this result and Wien's law, Eq. Expressed in notations introduced by Planck\ntwo months later, he proposed that\nwhich is indeed correct in the quantum regime hv/kT 3> 1, a condition that is\nwell satisfied in Paschen's experiment mentioned earlier (hv/kT ~ 15 for T =\n1000 K and X = 1 /urn).\nIt would do grave injustice to Planck if I left the reader with the impression\nthat Planck's discovery was exclusively the result of interpolating experimental\ndata. For years, it had been his ambition to derive the correct radiation law from\nfirst principles. I must refrain from discussing Planck's\nearlier research (cf. However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life.\n*Here I rely on the obituary of Rubens by Gerhard Hettner [HI], himself an experimental expert\non blackbody radiation.

This concerns a result Planck had obtained some\ntime earlier [P5].

This\nyields\nThis equation for the joint equilibrium of matter and radiation, one of Planck's\nimportant contributions to classical physics, was the starting point for his discovery\nof the quantum theory. As we soon shall see, this same equation was also the point\nof departure for Einstein's critique in 1905 of Planck's reasoning and for his quan-\ntum theory of specific heats. Planck concluded from Eq. I should rather say, what Planck held to be a statistical\nstep.\nFrom the point of view of physics in 1900 the logic of Planck's electromagnetic\nand thermodynamic steps was impeccable, but his statistical step was wild.\nIn 1931 Planck referred to it as 'an act of desperation. In Planck's opin-\nion, 'the electromagnetic theory of radiation does not provide us with any starting\npoint whatever to speak of such a probability [ WN] in a definite sense' [PI].\nHowever, let us leave aside for the moment what Planck did not do or what he\nmight have done and return to his unorthodox handling of Boltzmann's principle.\nIn his papers, Planck alluded to the inspiration he had received from Boltzmann's\nstatistical methods. The corresponding\ncounting problem, discussed previously in Section 4b, has nothing to do with\nPlanck's counting of partitions of indistinguishable objects, the energy elements. Planck himself knew that and said so.\n[P7]**\nThus the only justification for Planck's two desperate acts was that they gave him\nwhat he wanted. Although there have been other major innovations in\nphysics since December 1900, the world has not seen since a figure like Planck.\nFrom 1859 to 1926, blackbody radiation remained a problem at the frontier of\ntheoretical physics, first in thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the\nold quantum theory, and finally in quantum statistics. As Pringsheim put it in\na lecture given in 1903, 'Planck's equation is in such good agreement with exper-\niment that it can be considered, at least to high approximation, as the mathemat-\nical expression of Kirchhoff's function' [P8]. In 1901 Planck obtained from the available data the value\nh = 6. At the time of Planck's\n*In January 1905 and again in January 1906, Planck proposed Boltzmann for the Nobel prize.\n**The interesting suggestion has been made that Planck may have been led to Eq.3 X 10~10 [R3] was it realized how good Planck's value\nfor e was.\nFrom the very start, Planck's results were a source of inspiration and bewil-\nderment to Einstein. Addressing Planck in 1929, he said 'It is twenty-nine years\nago that I was inspired by his ingenious derivation of the radiation formula which\n. In 1913,\nEinstein wrote that Planck's work 'invigorates and at the same time makes so\ndifficult the physicist's existence.\nFrom my discussions with Einstein, I know that he venerated Planck as the\ndiscoverer of the quantum theory, that he deeply respected him as a human being\nwho stood firm under the inordinate sufferings of his personal life and of his coun-\ntry, and that he was grateful to him: 'You were the first to advocate the theory of\nrelativity' [El]. In 1918 he proposed Planck for the Nobel prize.* In 1948, after\nPlanck's death, Einstein wrote, 'This discovery [i.

But what was the meaning of Planck's\nderivation of that equation. The\nMarch paper opens with a section entitled 'on a difficulty concerning the theory\nof blackbody radiation,' in which he put these imperfections in sharp focus. The first of these was the Planck equation (Eq.16)\nwhere R is the gas constant, N Avogadro's number, and R/N (= k) the Boltz-\nmann constant (for a number of years, Einstein did not use the symbol k in his\npapers).\n'If Planck had drawn this conclusion, he would probably not have made his\ngreat discovery,' Einstein said later [E3].

Einstein on Planck: 1906\nIn 1906 Einstein returned once more to Planck's theory of 1900. Now he had\nmuch more positive things to say about Planck's radiation law. This change in\nattitude was due to his realization that 'Planck's theory makes implicit use of the\n. Einstein's reconsideration of Planck's reason-\ning and of its relation to his own work can be summarized in the following way:\n1. Planck had used the p- U relation, Eq. Planck had introduced a quantization related to U, namely, the prescription\nU = Phv/N(sce Eqs. He then re-examined the derivation of\nPlanck's law with the help of this new assumption. 'We must consider the following theorem to be the basis of\nPlanck's radiation theory: the energy of a [Planck oscillator] can take on only those\nvalues that are integral multiples of hv; in emission and absorption the energy of\na [Planck oscillator] changes by jumps which are multiples of hv.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions. We shall see in Section\n19f that Planck was not at all prepared to accept at once Einstein's reasoning,\ndespite the fact that it lent support to his own endeavors. As to Einstein himself,\nhis acceptance of Planck's Eq.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves. He also came to the (not quite correct) conclusion that 'If the\nobserved phenomenon is indeed an action of light, then it is only one of ultraviolet\nlight. Stimulated by Hertz's work, Wilhelm Hallwachs showed\nnext that irradiation with ultraviolet light causes uncharged metallic bodies to\nacquire a positive charge [H4]. His conclusion:\n'The value of m/e in the case of ultraviolet light.\n1905: Einstein. Second, the\nslope of the (E,v) plot is a universal constant, independent of the nature of the\nirradiated material. Third, the value of the slope was predicted to be Planck's\nconstant determined from the radiation law. However, soon thereafter\nJeans stated in his important survey of the theory of radiation [ J3] that 'there is\nalmost general agreement' that Eq.24 holds very well\nand 'Planck's h has been photoelectrically determined with a precision of about\n0.) Working with an X-ray tube operated at a constant potential V, they\nfound that the X-ray frequencies produced have a sharp upper limit v given by\neV = hv, as had been predicted by Einstein in 1906. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next. He could formulate it clearly\nonly in the domain hv/kT^>\\, where Wien's blackbody radiation law holds.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 383\nhe had used this law as an experimental fact without explaining it.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Yet the resistance to Planck's ideas\u2014while cer-\ntainly not absent\u2014was much less pronounced and vehement than in the case of\nEinstein. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation. By and\nlarge, no comparable breakthroughs occurred in regard to the most difficult of all\nquestions concerning electromagnetic phenomena: the interaction between matter\nand radiation.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. His reasoning alleged to involve only a modification of the interaction\nbetween matter and radiation. Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nThis difference in assessment of the two theoretical issues, one raised by Planck,\none by Einstein, is quite evident in the writings of the leading theorists of the day.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. In 1907 he wrote to\nEinstein:\nI am not seeking the meaning of the quantum of action [light-quanta] in the\nvacuum but rather in places where absorption and emission occur, and [I]\nassume that what happens in the vacuum is rigorously described by Maxwell's\nequations. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9]. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Yet the resistance to the\nideas of Planck and Bohr\u2014while certainly not absent\u2014was much less pro-\nnounced and vehement than in the case of Einstein. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. In the first instance, experi-\nment also set the pace for the acceptance of the Planck formula. Unlike Bohr and Planck, Einstein had to wait a\ndecade before he saw one of his predictions, the linear E-v relation, vindicated,\nas was discussed in the previous section. The fact of the matter is that, even after Ein-\nstein's photoelectric law was accepted, almost no one but Einstein himself would\nhave anything to do with light-quanta.Kangro, History of Planck's Radiation Law. Einstein, December 27, 1907. Planck in M. Planck, Physikalische Abhandlungen und Vortrage (M.

Wien, Math.", "Radiation_Theory_1905": "\nConsider a body in thermal equilibrium with radiation. Let the radiation\nenergy which the body absorbs be converted to thermal energy only, not to any\nother energy form. He also gave an operational definition for a system, the\n'Hohlraumstrahlung,' which acts as a perfect blackbody: 'Given a space enclosed\nby bodies of equal temperature, through which no radiation can penetrate, then\nevery bundle of radiation within this space is constituted, with respect to quality\nand intensity, as if it came from a completely black body of the same temperature. Experimentalists had to cope with three\nmain problems: (1) to construct manageable bodies with perfectly black properties,\n(2) to devise radiation detectors with adequate sensitivity, and (3) to find ways of\nextending the measurements over large frequency domains. A quarter of a century passed\nbefore the next theoretical advance in blackbody radiation came about.\nIn 1879 Josef Stefan conjectured on experimental grounds that the total energy\nradiated by a hot body varies with the fourth power of the absolute temperature\n[SI]. His proof again involved thermodynamics, but combined this time with a\nstill younger branch of theoretical physics: the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell.\nFor the case of Hohlraumstrahlung, the radiation is homogeneous, isotropic,\nand unpolarized, so that\none had come as far as possible on the basis of thermodynamics and general elec-\ntromagnetic theory. All these guesses may be forgotten except for one, Wien's exponential\nlaw, proposed in 1896 [W2]:(19.4)This law was the very first thermodynamic consequence derived from Maxwell's\ntheorem, according to which the numerical value of the radiation pressure equals\none third of the energy per unit volume. For a brief period, it appeared that Wien's\nlaw was the final answer. The other was the persistence and vision of Planck. At the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt, at that\ntime probably the world's best-equipped physics laboratory, two teams were\nindependently at work on blackbody radiation experiments. The first sentence of the first\npaper in the first issue of the Physical Review reads as follows: 'Within a few\nyears the study of obscure radiation has been greatly advanced by systematic\ninquiry into the laws of dispersion of the infrared rays. These experimental developments\nare of fundamental importance for our main subject, the quantum theory, since\nthey were crucial to the discovery of the blackbody radiation law.5)\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM367\nSample of the Rubens-Kurlbaum data which led Planck to guess his radiation formula\n[Rl].\nPlanck most probably* discovered his law in the early evening of Sunday,\nOctober 7. For years, it had been his ambition to derive the correct radiation law from\nfirst principles. However,\nit is very important for an understanding of Einstein's starting point in 1905 and\nof the subsequent reactions to the light-quantum hypothesis to give a brief account\nof Planck's activities from October to December 1900, the heroic period of his life.\n*Here I rely on the obituary of Rubens by Gerhard Hettner [HI], himself an experimental expert\non blackbody radiation.6 contains Wien's law of 1896:\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 369\nEven if Planck had stopped after October 19, he would forever be remembered\nas the discoverer of the radiation law. That made him the discoverer of\nthe quantum theory.\nThe Electromagnetic Step. Consider in par-\nticular the case in which the radiation damping due to the 'x term is very small,\nthat is, 7 <sC v, where 7 = Si^eV/Smc3. This\nyields\nThis equation for the joint equilibrium of matter and radiation, one of Planck's\nimportant contributions to classical physics, was the starting point for his discovery\nof the quantum theory. As we soon shall see, this same equation was also the point\nof departure for Einstein's critique in 1905 of Planck's reasoning and for his quan-\ntum theory of specific heats.\nFrom the point of view of physics in 1900 the logic of Planck's electromagnetic\nand thermodynamic steps was impeccable, but his statistical step was wild. In Planck's opin-\nion, 'the electromagnetic theory of radiation does not provide us with any starting\npoint whatever to speak of such a probability [ WN] in a definite sense' [PI]. Deeply rooted\nin nineteenth century thinking and prejudice, he made the first conceptual break\nthat has made twentieth century physics look so discontinuously different from\nthat of the preceding era. Although there have been other major innovations in\nphysics since December 1900, the world has not seen since a figure like Planck.\nFrom 1859 to 1926, blackbody radiation remained a problem at the frontier of\ntheoretical physics, first in thermodynamics, then in electromagnetism, then in the\nold quantum theory, and finally in quantum statistics. From the experimental\npoint of view, the right answer had been found by 1900. In 1901 Planck obtained from the available data the value\nh = 6. At the time of Planck's\n*In January 1905 and again in January 1906, Planck proposed Boltzmann for the Nobel prize.\n**The interesting suggestion has been made that Planck may have been led to Eq. Not until 1908, when the charge of the alpha\nparticle was found to be 9. Addressing Planck in 1929, he said 'It is twenty-nine years\nago that I was inspired by his ingenious derivation of the radiation formula which\n. to adapt the theoretical foundations\nof physics to this [new type of] knowledge failed completely., the quantum theory] set sci-\nence a fresh task: that of finding a new conceptual basis for all of physics. Nothing further\nhappened in quantum physics after 1901 until Einstein proposed the light-quan-\ntum hypothesis. Einstein on Planck: 1905.\nThe Rayleigh-Einstein-Jeans Law\nThe first sentence on the quantum theory published by Einstein was written in\nthe month of March, in the year 1905. It is the title of his first paper on light-\nquanta, 'On a heuristic point of view concerning the generation and conversion of\nlight' [E5, Al]. Whatever one may think of the\nstatus of the quantum theory in 1955, in 1905 this opinion was, of course, entirely\njustified.6 as 'the Planck formula,\nwhich agrees with all experiments to date. 'The imperfections of [that derivation] remained at\nfirst hidden, which was most fortunate for the development of physics' [E3]. The\nMarch paper opens with a section entitled 'on a difficulty concerning the theory\nof blackbody radiation,' in which he put these imperfections in sharp focus. The first of these was the Planck equation (Eq.\nand went on to note that this classical relation is in disagreement with experiment\nand has the disastrous consequence that a = oo, where a is the Stefan-Boltzmann\nconstant given in Eq. Planck had obtained Eq. Dur-\ning the 1890s, Planck had made several errors in reasoning before he arrived at\nhis radiation law, but none as astounding and of as great an historical significance\nas his fortunate failure to be the first to derive Eq. It contains for the\nfirst time the suggestion to apply to radiation 'the Maxwell -Boltzmann doctrine\nof the partition of energy' (i.\nThus the experimentalists close to Planck were well aware of Rayleigh's work. Whichever may be the case,\nin 1900 Planck did not refer to Rayleigh's contribution.\nIn July 1905 Rayleigh acknowledges Jeans' contribution [R6]. From 1900 to 1905, Planck's radiation formula\nwas generally considered to be neither more nor less than a successful represen-\ntation of the data (see [Bl]). Only in 1905 did it begin to dawn, and then only on\n* Planck derived his radiation law in a circuitous way via the equilibrium properties of his material\noscillators. He did so because of his simultaneous concern with two questions, How is radiative\nequilibrium established. This enabled him to apply equipartition directly to these radiation oscillators.\n**This same observation was also made independently by Einstein in 1905 [E5].** In order to suppress the catastrophic high frequency behavior, he intro-\nduces next an ad hoc exponential cutoff factor and proposes the overall radiation\nlaw\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 375\na few, that a crisis in physics was at hand [E6].\nThe March paper, the first of Einstein's six papers written in 1905, was com-\npleted almost exactly one year after he had finished the single article he published\nin 1904 [E7], in which Planck is mentioned for the first time (see Section 4c). In the final section,\n'Application to radiation,' he had discussed energy fluctuations of radiation near\nthermal equilibrium. He was also on his way from statistical\nphysics to quantum physics.19)\n1 his value is just as good as the one Planck had tound trom his radiation law,\nbut, Einstein argued, if I use Eq.\nEinstein derived the above value for N in the light-quantum paper, completed\nin March 1905. I have already discussed the important role that Einstein's May\n1905 method, Brownian motion, played in the consolidation of the value for N.\nIn 1905, it was Einstein's position that Eq. He therefore set out to study blackbody radiation in a new way\n'which is not based on a picture of the generation and propagation of radiation'\u2014\nthat is, which does not make use of Planck's equation (Eq. He extracted the light-quantum postulate\nfrom an analogy between radiation in the Wien regime and a classical ideal gas\nof material particles.\nNow to the radiation problem.22)\nLet the radiation be contained in a volume v.20 and we have Einstein's\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 377\nLight-quantum hypothesis: Monochromatic radiation of low density [i. That choice is less surprising\nif one recalls* that a year earlier the question of volume dependence had seemed\nquite important to him for the analysis of the energy fluctuations of radiation.\nEinstein's introduction of light-quanta in the Wien regime is the first step\ntoward the concept of radiation as a Bose gas of photons. Just as was the case for\nPlanck's derivation of his radiation law, Einstein's derivation of the light-quantum\nhypothesis grew out of statistical mechanics. The physicist of 1905 could take or leave the\nlight-quantum hypothesis as nothing more than a curious property of pure radia-\ntion in thermal equilibrium, without any physical consequence.\nI shall leave Einstein's applications of the heuristic principle to Section 19e and\nshall describe next how, in 1906, Einstein ceased assiduously avoiding Planck's\nequation (Eq. Einstein on Planck: 1906\nIn 1906 Einstein returned once more to Planck's theory of 1900. Now he had\nmuch more positive things to say about Planck's radiation law. 'We must consider the following theorem to be the basis of\nPlanck's radiation theory: the energy of a [Planck oscillator] can take on only those\nvalues that are integral multiples of hv; in emission and absorption the energy of\na [Planck oscillator] changes by jumps which are multiples of hv.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter. Finally I outline the developments\nup to 1916, by which time Einstein's predictions were confirmed. In 1905, however, the\nsubject was still in its infancy. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves. The high school teachers Julius Elster and Hans Geitel\npioneered the study of photoelectric effects in vacuum tubes and constructed the\nfirst phototubes [E9]; they also performed fundamental experiments in radioac-\ntivity. Pierre Curie and one of his co-workers were the first to discover that pho-\ntoelectric effects can be induced by X-rays [Cl]. Five experimental observations made within the span of one\ndecade largely shaped the physics of the twentieth century. In order of appearance,\nthey are the discoveries of the photoelectric effect, X-rays, radioactivity, the Zee-\nman effect, and the electron. Hertz\nfound the photoeffect when he became intrigued by a side effect he had observed\nin the course of his investigations on the electromagnetic wave nature of light\n[H3]. He also came to the (not quite correct) conclusion that 'If the\nobserved phenomenon is indeed an action of light, then it is only one of ultraviolet\nlight. Stimulated by Hertz's work, Wilhelm Hallwachs showed\nnext that irradiation with ultraviolet light causes uncharged metallic bodies to\nacquire a positive charge [H4].\nThe earliest speculations on the nature of the effect predate the discovery of the\nelectron in 1897. He began\nhis photoelectric studies by measuring the e/m of the particles produced by light,\nusing the same method he had applied to cathode rays two years earlier (the par-\nticle beams move through crossed electric and magnetic fields). His conclusion:\n'The value of m/e in the case of ultraviolet light.' In 1897 he had been unable to determine m or e separately for cathode\nrays. In 1902 Philip Lenard studied the photoeffect using a carbon\narc light as a source.\n1905: Einstein. He also noted that an electron\nejected from the interior of the body will in general suffer an energy loss before\nwhere v is the frequency of the incident (monochromatic) radiation and P is the\nwork function, the energy needed to escape the surface. Second, the\nslope of the (E,v) plot is a universal constant, independent of the nature of the\nirradiated material. Third, the value of the slope was predicted to be Planck's\nconstant determined from the radiation law.\nEinstein gave several other applications of his heuristic principle: (1) the fre-\nquency of light in photoluminescence cannot exceed the frequency of the incident\nlight (Stokes's rule) [E5]; (2) in photbionization, the energy of the emitted electron\ncannot exceed hv, where v is the incident light frequency [E5];* (3) in 1906, he\ndiscussed the application to the inverse photoeffect (the Volta effect) [E8]; (4) in\n1909, he treated the generation of secondary cathode rays by X-rays [Ell]; (5) in\n1911, he used the principle to predict the high-frequency limit in Bremsstrahlung\n[E12]. However, soon thereafter\nJeans stated in his important survey of the theory of radiation [ J3] that 'there is\nalmost general agreement' that Eq. A long paper published in 1916 gives the details of the\n*In 1912, Einstein [E10] noted that the heuristic principle could be applied not only to photonion-\nization but also in a quite similar way to photochemical processes. His interest in X-rays was due largely to the role they play in cancer\ntherapy.) Working with an X-ray tube operated at a constant potential V, they\nfound that the X-ray frequencies produced have a sharp upper limit v given by\neV = hv, as had been predicted by Einstein in 1906.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. This led him to approach quantum problems with great cau-\ntion in his writings\u2014a caution already evident in the way the title of his March\npaper was phrased. He could formulate it clearly\nonly in the domain hv/kT^>\\, where Wien's blackbody radiation law holds. Above all, it\nwas obvious to him from the start that grave tensions existed between his principle\nand the wave picture of electromagnetic radiation\u2014tensions which, in his own\nmind, were resolved neither then nor later.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. the apparently complete success of the Einstein\nequation [for the photoeffect], the physical theory of which it was designed to be\nthe symbolic expression is found so untenable that Einstein himself, I believe, no\nlonger holds to it' [M4]. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation. By and\nlarge, no comparable breakthroughs occurred in regard to the most difficult of all\nquestions concerning electromagnetic phenomena: the interaction between matter\nand radiation. There, advances became possible only after the advent of quantum\nfield theory, when the concepts of particle creation and annihilation were formu-\nlated.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. He was unaware of the fact\nthat his proposal implied the need for a revision of the classical radiation field\nitself. His reasoning alleged to involve only a modification of the interaction\nbetween matter and radiation. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9].\nThus by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, many leading\ntheorists were prepared to accept the fact that the quantum theory was here to\nstay. However, the Maxwell theory of the free radiation field, pure and simple,\nprovided neither room for modification (it seemed) nor a place to hide one's igno-\nrance, in contrast with the less transparent situation concerning the interaction\nbetween matter and radiation. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein. His proximity to the first-rate experiments on blackbody radia-\ntion being performed at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin was\nbeyond doubt a crucial factor in his discovery of 1900 (though it would be very\nwrong to say that this was the only decisive factor).\nTo be sure, he had mentioned a number of experimental consequences of his\nhypothesis in his 1905 paper. In\n386 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n1918, Rutherford commented on the Duane-Hunt results, 'There is at present no\nphysical explanation possible of this remarkable connection between energy and\nfrequency' [R7].\nThis went on until the early 1920s, as is best illustrated by quoting the citation\nfor Einstein's Nobel prize in 1922: 'To Albert Einstein for his services to theoret-\nical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect'\n[A2].\nRight after March 1905, Einstein sat down and wrote his doctoral thesis. However, in 1906 he made\nanother important contribution to quantum physics, his theory of specific heats.

Our\nnext subject will be two profound papers on radiation published in 1909.\nThese papers are not as widely known as they should be because they address\nquestions of principle without offering any new experimental conclusion or pre-\ndiction, as had been the case for the first light-quantum paper (photoeffect) and\nthe paper on specific heats. The blackbody radiation\nlaw had meanwhile been found by Planck. As is so typical for\nEinstein, he derived this statistical physics equation in a paper devoted to the\nquantum theory, the January 1909 paper. His purpose for doing so was to apply\n402\nTHE PHOTON 403\nthis result to energy fluctuations of blackbody radiation in a frequency interval\nbetween v and v + dv.5, Einstein stressed that 'the current theory of radia-\ntion is incompatible with this result.' By current theory, he meant, of course, the\nclassical wave theory of light.5, Einstein had this to say: 'If it alone were present, it would\nresult in fluctuations [to be expected] if radiation were to consist of independently\nmoving pointlike quanta with energy hi>.' His vision of light-quanta as particles is especially evident in a\nletter to Sommerfeld, also dating from 1909, in which he writes of 'the ordering\nof the energy of light around discrete points which move with light velocity' [E4].5 suggests (loosely speaking) that the particle and wave aspects of\nradiation occur side by side. This is one of the arguments which led Einstein in\n1909 to summarize his view on the status of the radiation theory in the following\nway.*\nI already attempted earlier to show that our current foundations of the radiation\ntheory have to be abandoned. In 1909, at age\nthirty, he was prepared for a fusion theory. It may have distressed him that one statement he made\nin 1909 needed revision: moving light-quanta with energy hv are not pointlike.3 from classical electromagnetic theory [LI].\nTHE PHOTON 405\nIt was known at that time that one can obtain Planck's expression for p by\nintroducing the quantum prescription* that the electromagnetic field oscillators\ncould have only energies nhv. Spontaneous and Induced Radiative Transitions\nAfter 1909 Einstein continued brooding about the light-quantum for almost\nanother two years.\nIn October 1911 Einstein (now a professor in Prague) gave a report on the quan-\ntum theory to the first Solvay Congress [E7], but by this time general relativity\nhad already become his main concern and would remain so until November 1915.\nIn 1916, he returned once again to blackbody radiation and made his next\nadvance. In November 1916 he wrote to Besso, 'A splended light has dawned on\nme about the absorption and emission of radiation' [E8]. He had obtained a deep\ninsight into the meaning of his heuristic principle, and this led him to a new der-\nivation of Planck's radiation law. His\nmethod is based on general hypotheses about the interaction between radiation\nand matter. No special assumptions are made about intrinsic properties of the\nobjects which interact with the radiation.)\nEinstein considered a system consisting of a gas of his molecules interacting\nwith electromagnetic radiation.8, p\nis a function of v and T, where 'we shall assume that a molecule can go from the\nstate En to the state Em by absorption of radiation with a definite frequency v, and\n[similarly] for emission' [E9]. By this\nremarkable reasoning, Einstein therefore established a bridge between blackbody\nradiation and Bohr's theory of spectra.\nTwo of the three papers under discussion [E10, Ell] contained another result,\none which Einstein himself considered far more important than his derivation of\nthe radiation law: light-quanta carry a momentum hv/c. I shall return to the nonconservation of photon number in Chapter 23, but\nwould like to note here an ironic twist of history. The term photon first appeared\nin the title of a paper written in 1926: 'The Conservation of Photons. Its subject was 'electrons et\nphotons. It was via the analysis of statistical fluctuations of blackbody radiation\nthat Einstein eventually came to associate a definite momentum with a light-quan-\ntum. Momentum Fluctuations: 1909. Einstein's first results bearing on the\nquestion of photon momentum are found in the two 1909 papers. This\nforce would eventually bring the mirror to rest were it not for the momentum\nfluctuation term A, induced by the fluctuations of the radiation pressure.17 would lead Einstein to\nstate, in 1909, the 'momentum quantum postulate': monochromatic radiation of\nlow density behaves in regard to pressure fluctuations as if it consists of mutually\nindependent momentum quanta of magnitude hv/' c.\nWhat he did say was, 'If the radiation were to consist of very few extended\ncomplexes with energy hv which move independently through space and which\nare independently reflected\u2014a picture that represents the roughest visualization\nof the light-quantum hypothesis\u2014then as a consequence of fluctuations in the\nradiation pressure there would act on our plate only such momenta as are repre-\nsented by the first term of our formula [Eq. Yet a particle concept (the photon) was clearly on his mind, since he went\non to conjecture that 'the electromagnetic fields of light are linked to singular\npoints similar to the occurrence of electrostatic fields in the theory of electrons'\n[E3].\nThe photon momentum made its explicit appearance in that same year, 1909. As an example, he mentioned Bremsstrahlung, for which he wrote\ndown the equation\nthe first occasion on record in which the photon enters explicitly into the law of\nmomentum conservation for an elementary process. Einstein himself did not explicitly intro-\nduce photon momentum until 1916, in the course of his studies on thermal equi-\nlibrium between electromagnetic radiation and a molecular gas [E10, Ell]. How is this distribution maintained in time considering the fact\nthat the molecules are subject to the influence of radiation pressure.18)\n410 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nTechnically, the following issue arises. Question: What can one say about the\ndegree of directedness of the emitted or absorbed radiation for the system under\nconsideration. Einstein began the discussion of this question in the same way he\nhad treated the mirror problem in 1909.16, he\nhad to invoke a condition of directedness: 'if a bundle of radiation causes a mole-\ncule to emit or absorb an energy amount hv, then a momentum hv/c is transferred\nto the molecule, directed along the bundle for absorption and opposite the bundle\nfor [induced] emission' [El 1].8) requires that the radiation be fully directed (this is often called\nNadelstrahlung). Earliest Unbehagen about Chance\nEinstein prefaced his statement about photon momentum just quoted with the\nremark that this conclusion can be considered 'als ziemlich sicher erwiesen,' as\nfairly certainly proven. In a letter to\n*In 1910, Einstein had made a related calculation, together with Hopf [E12]. At that time, he used\nthe classical electromagnetic theory to compute (A2) and P.\nTHE PHOTON 411\nBesso about the needle rays, he wrote, 'Damit sind die Lichtquanten so gut wie\ngesichert' [E13].* And, in a phrase contained in another letter about two years\nlater, 'I do not doubt anymore the reality of radiation quanta, although I still\nstand quite alone in this conviction,' he underlined the word 'Realitat' [E14]. This earliest unease stemmed\nfrom the conclusion concerning spontaneous emission that Einstein had been\nforced to draw from his consistency condition (Eq.16): the needle ray picture\napplies not only to induced processes (as was mentioned above) but also to spon-\ntaneous emission. They also apply to another class of emission\nprocesses, the spontaneity of which had puzzled physicists since the turn of the\ncentury: radioactive transformations. A spontaneous emission coefficient was in\nfact first introduced by Rutherford in 1900 when he derived** the equation dN\n= \u2014\\Ndt for the decrease of the number N of radioactive thorium emanation\natoms in the time interval dt [R2]. Einstein himself drew attention to this simi-\nlarity: 'It speaks in favor of the theory that the statistical law assumed for [spon-\ntaneous] emission is nothing but the Rutherford law of radioactive decay' [E9]. I should now add that Einstein was the first to realize that the\nprobability for spontaneous emission is a nonclassical quantity.16] make it seem\nalmost inevitable to formulate a truly quantized theory of radiation.\n**Here a development began which, two years later, culminated in the transformation theory for\nradioactive substances [Rl].\n412 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nunderstood as yet' [E15]. One\nfurther example may show how from 1917 on he could not make his peace with\nthe quantum theory. An Aside: Quantum Conditions for Nonseparable Classical Motion\nIn May 1917, shortly after Einstein finished his triple of papers on the quantum\ntheory of radiation, he wrote an article on the restrictions imposed by the 'old'\nquantum theory on classically allowed orbits in phase space [El7], to which he\nadded a brief mathematical sequel a few months later [E18]. The Compton Effect\nI return to the photon story and come to its denouement. Even those opposed to quantized radiation might\nhave found these relations to their liking since (independent of any quantum\ndynamics) they yield at once significant differences from the classical theories of\nthe scattering of light by matter** and therefore provide simple tests of the photon\nidea. First, because photons were rejected out of\nhand by the vast majority of physicists, few may have felt compelled to ask for\ntests of an idea they did not believe to begin with.f Debye, incidentally, mentioned his indebtedness to Ein-\nstein's work on needle radiation [D2].\nThe same paper in which Compton discussed Eqs. Compton found this relation to be satisfied\n* Einstein attached great importance to an advance in another direction that took place in the inter-\nvening years: the effect discovered by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach [E21].\n**For details on these classical theories, see Stuewer's fine monograph on the Compton effect [S2]. In his paper, Debye acknowledges a 1922 report by Compton in which the evidence against\nthe classical theory was reviewed. In fact, after\n1917 nothing particularly memorable happened in regard to light-quanta until\ncapital progress was achieved* when Arthur Compton [Cl] and Debye [D2]\nindependently derived the relativistic kinematics for the scattering of a photon off\nan electron at rest:\n(21.* The quality of the experiment is well demonstrated by the value\nhe obtained for the Compton wavelength: h/mc \u00ab 0. Compton concluded, 'The experimental support of the theory indicates\nvery convincingly that a radiation quantum carries with it directed momentum as\nwell as energy.'**\nThis discovery 'created a sensation among the physicists of that time' [Al]. Nevertheless, the photon idea was rapidly accepted. Sommerfeld\nincorporated the Compton effect in his new edition of Atombau und Spektrallinien\nwith the comment, 'It is probably the most important discovery which could have\nbeen made in the current state of physics' [S3]. A year after Compton's experiments, Einstein\nwrote a popular article for Berliner Tageblatt, which ends as follows: 'The posi-\ntive result of the Compton experiment proves that radiation behaves as if it con-\nsisted of discrete energy projectiles, not only in regard to energy transfer but also\nin regard to Stosswirkung (momentum transfer)' [E24]. In both cases, we encounter the phra-\nseology, 'Radiation . Compton, Phys. Scat-\ntered X-rays at 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0 were analyzed.\n**The work of Compton and Debye led Pauli to extend Einstein's work of 1917 to the case of\nradiation in equilibrium with free electrons [P3].

Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nThis difference in assessment of the two theoretical issues, one raised by Planck,\none by Einstein, is quite evident in the writings of the leading theorists of the day.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9]. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Yet the resistance to the\nideas of Planck and Bohr\u2014while certainly not absent\u2014was much less pro-\nnounced and vehement than in the case of Einstein. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. In the first instance, experi-\nment also set the pace for the acceptance of the Planck formula. At\nthe same time, however, neither Einstein nor any one else denied the fact that\nPlanck's highly nontrivial universal curve admirably fitted the data.

This change in\nattitude was due to his realization that 'Planck's theory makes implicit use of the\n. Einstein's reconsideration of Planck's reason-\ning and of its relation to his own work can be summarized in the following way:\n1. Planck had used the p- U relation, Eq. Planck had introduced a quantization related to U, namely, the prescription\nU = Phv/N(sce Eqs. Einstein had introduced a quantization related to p: the light-quantum hypoth-\nesis. The question arises of whether a connection can be established between\nPlanck's quantization related to U and Einstein's quantization related to p. He then re-examined the derivation of\nPlanck's law with the help of this new assumption. 'We must consider the following theorem to be the basis of\nPlanck's radiation theory: the energy of a [Planck oscillator] can take on only those\nvalues that are integral multiples of hv; in emission and absorption the energy of\na [Planck oscillator] changes by jumps which are multiples of hv.' Thus already\nin 1906 Einstein correctly guessed the main properties of a quantum mechanical\nmaterial oscillator and its behavior in radiative transitions. We shall see in Section\n19f that Planck was not at all prepared to accept at once Einstein's reasoning,\ndespite the fact that it lent support to his own endeavors. As to Einstein himself,\nhis acceptance of Planck's Eq.11, albeit as a hypothesis, led to a major advance\nin his own work: the quantum theory of specific heats, to be discussed in the next\nchapter.\nTHE LIGHT-QUANTUM 379\n19e. We have a detailed picture of the status of photo-\nelectricity a few months before Einstein finished his paper on light-quanta: the\nfirst review article on the photoelectric effect, completed in December 1904 [S2],\nshows that at that time photoelectricity was as much a frontier subject as were\nradioactivity, cathode ray physics, and (to a slightly lesser extent) the study of\nHertzian waves.\n1905: Einstein.

Working with an X-ray tube operated at a constant potential V, they\nfound that the X-ray frequencies produced have a sharp upper limit v given by\neV = hv, as had been predicted by Einstein in 1906. Reactions to the Light-Quantum Hypothesis\nComments by Planck, Nernst, Rubens, and Warburg written in 1913 when they\nproposed Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy will set the right tone\nfor what follows next.*\nThroughout his scientific career, quantum physics remained a crisis phenome-\nnon to Einstein. He could formulate it clearly\nonly in the domain hv/kT^>\\, where Wien's blackbody radiation law holds.\nThe first of these was his admirer von Laue, who wrote Einstein in 1906, 'To me\nat least, any paper in which probability considerations are applied to the vacuum\nseems very dubious'[L7], and who wrote him again at the end of 1907, 'I would\nlike to tell you how pleased I am that you have given up your light-quantum\ntheory' [L8]. In 1912 Sommerfeld wrote, 'Einstein drew the most far-reaching\nconsequences from Planck's discovery [of the quantum of action] and transferred\nthe quantum properties of emission and absorption phenomena to the structure of\nlight energy in space without, as I believe, maintaining today his original point of\nview [of 1905] in all its audacity' [S3]. the apparently complete success of the Einstein\nequation [for the photoeffect], the physical theory of which it was designed to be\nthe symbolic expression is found so untenable that Einstein himself, I believe, no\nlonger holds to it' [M4]. Einstein's March paper\nis the second of the revolutionary papers on the old quantum theory. The first one\nwas, of course, Planck's of December 1900 [P4]. Yet the resistance to Planck's ideas\u2014while cer-\ntainly not absent\u2014was much less pronounced and vehement than in the case of\nEinstein. Its main discoveries con-\ncerned quantum rules for stationary states of matter and of pure radiation.\nAs we saw in Section 19a, when Planck introduced the quantum in order to\ndescribe the spectral properties of pure radiation he did so by a procedure of quan-\n384 THE QUANTUM THEORY\ntization applied to matter, to his material oscillators. Therefore, it seemed less repugnant to accept Planck's extravaganzas than\nEinstein's.\nThis difference in assessment of the two theoretical issues, one raised by Planck,\none by Einstein, is quite evident in the writings of the leading theorists of the day.\nPlanck himself had grave reservations about light-quanta. [Pll]\nA remark by Planck at a physics meeting in 1909 vividly illustrates his and others'\npredilections for 'leaving alone' the radiation field and for seeking the resolution\nof the quantum paradoxes in the interactions:\nI believe one should first try to move the whole difficulty of the quantum theory\nto the domain of the interaction between matter and radiation. [PI2]\nIn that same year, Lorentz expressed his belief in 'Planck's hypothesis of the\nenergy elements' but also his strong reservations regarding 'light-quanta which\nretain their individuality in propagation' [L9]. The first three revolutionary papers on the\nold quantum theory were those by Planck [P4], Einstein [E5], and Bohr [B2]. Yet the resistance to the\nideas of Planck and Bohr\u2014while certainly not absent\u2014was much less pro-\nnounced and vehement than in the case of Einstein. Meanwhile, I shall discuss next the influence of experimental devel-\nopments on the acceptance of the ideas of Planck, Bohr, and Einstein.\nFirst, Planck. In the first instance, experi-\nment also set the pace for the acceptance of the Planck formula. At\nthe same time, however, neither Einstein nor any one else denied the fact that\nPlanck's highly nontrivial universal curve admirably fitted the data. Unlike Bohr and Planck, Einstein had to wait a\ndecade before he saw one of his predictions, the linear E-v relation, vindicated,\nas was discussed in the previous section. In\n386 THE QUANTUM THEORY\n1918, Rutherford commented on the Duane-Hunt results, 'There is at present no\nphysical explanation possible of this remarkable connection between energy and\nfrequency' [R7].

I mention this incorrect speculation only in order to stress one\nimportant point: before Einstein's paper of 1906, it was not realized that the dia-\nmond anomaly was to be understood in terms of the failure (or, rather, the inap-\nplicability) of the classical equipartition theorem.\nBy sharp contrast, it was well appreciated that the equipartition theorem was\nin trouble when applied to the specific heat of gases.

The equipartition theorem was therefore very helpful, yet, on the whole, the\nspecific heat of gases remained a murky subject. In 1895 he suggested a way out: the equi-\npartition theorem is correct for gases but does not apply to the combined gas-\naether system because there is no thermal equilibrium: 'The entire ether has not\nhad time to come into thermal equilibrium with the gas molecules and has in no\nway attained the state which it would have if it were enclosed for an infinitely\nlong time in the same vessel with the molecules of the gas' [B6].\nKelvin took a different position; he felt that the classical equipartition theorem\nwas wrong.

Einstein in 1912\n20a. Specific Heats in the Nineteenth Century\nBy the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, three major quantum the-\noretical discoveries had been made. Einstein's hypothesis was many years ahead of its decisive experimental\ntests. Einstein's first paper on the subject [El], submitted in November 1906,\ncontains the qualitatively correct explanation of an anomaly that had been\nobserved as early as 1840: the low value of the specific heat of diamond at room\ntemperature. It also represents one of only\nthree instances I know of in which Einstein published a graph to compare theory\nwith experiment (another example will be mentioned in Section 20b). As I just mentioned, peculiarities in specific heats were diagnosed more\nthan half a century before Einstein explained them. It was also known well before\n1906 that specific heats of gases exhibited even more curious properties.\nFor a perspective on Einstein's contributions, it is necessary to sketch the answer\nto these questions.

Tiny variations in specific heats\nwith temperature had long been known for some substances (for example, water)\n[Nl]. His measurements for twelve different temperatures\nbetween 0\u00b0 and 200\u00b0 C confirmed his conjecture: for diamond c varied by a factor\nof 3 over this range.' The next time we hear from Weber is in 1875, when he presented his beau-\ntiful specific heat measurements for boron, silicon, graphite, and diamond, from\n-100\u00b0 to 1000\u00b0C [W2].\n**Weber was Einstein's teacher, whom we encountered in Chapter 3.

Even though this is a topic that does\nnot directly bear on Einstein's work in 1906, I believe it will be useful to complete\nthe nineteenth century picture with a brief explanation of why gases caused so\nmuch more aggravation. Every additional variable increases the specific heat.

His idea about\nthe anomalies for the specific heats of solids could not work for gases.\nSuch was the state of affairs when Einstein took on the specific heat problem. Einstein's work on specific heats [El] is above all\nimportant because it made clear for the first time that quantum concepts have a\nfar more general applicability. His 1906 paper is also unusual because here we\nmeet an Einstein who is quite prepared to use a model he knows to be approxi-\nmate in order to bring home a point of principle.\nEarlier in 1906 Einstein had come to accept Planck's relation (Eq.

This value is much too large to be\naccommodated (simultaneously with Weber's points) by Einstein's Eq. Einstein himself explored some\nmodifications of this assumption [ E4]. Einstein had ended his active research on the specific heats of\nsolids by the time the work of Debye and the more exact treatment of lattice\nvibrations by Max Born and Theodore von Karman appeared [B7].\nHowever, in 1913 Einstein returned once again to specific heats, this time to\nconsider the case of gases. In a\npaper on this subject, we find another instance of curve fitting by Einstein [E6].*\nIn 1925 Einstein was to turn his attention one last time to gases at very low\ntemperatures, as we shall see in Section 23b.'

In 1910 Einstein\nwrote to a friend, 'At present, I have high hopes for solving the radiation problem,\nand that without light quanta.\n**A letter from Ehrenfest to Einstein shows that Bohr's thoughts had gone in that direction at least\nas early as 1922 [E8[.\nHeisenberg wrote to Pauli that he had met Einstein in Goettingen and that the\nlatter had 'a hundred objections' [H2].\nEinstein had given a colloquium on this paper, at which he had raised objec-\ntions.\n**On October 25, 1924, the Danish newspaper Politiken carried an item on the Bohr-Einstein\ncontroversy. This led the editor of a German newspaper to send a query to Einstein [Jl]. Einstein\nsent a brief reply [E12], acknowledging that a conflict existed and adding that no written exchanges\nbetween himself and Bohr had resulted. Einstein's views had\nbeen fully vindicated. In July\n1925 he wrote, 'One must be prepared for the fact that the required generalization\nof the classical electrodynamic theory demands a profound revolution in the con-\ncepts on which the description of nature has until now been founded' [B4].

In a letter to\nEhrenfest, written in July, Einstein did not withdraw, but did qualify his praise\nof Bose's paper: Bose's 'derivation is elegant but the essence remains obscure' [El ].

Einstein replied, 'This [objection] is entirely\ncorrect' [E7]. Einstein on Indistinguishability. In order to illustrate further the differ-\nences between the new and the old counting of macrostates, Einstein cast W in awith v = V/N.\nIn his second paper [E7], the most important one of the three, Einstein began\nwith the v \u2014 T relation at A = 1:\n(23.

After 1917 Einstein ceased to\nwrite scientific articles on questions related to radiation. I found a notice\nby Einstein in 1930 announcing a new paper on radiation fluctuations [E10]. Postscript on Bose-Einstein Condensation\n(1) In December 1924, Einstein wrote to Ehrenfest, 'From a certain tempera-\nture on, the molecules \"condense\" without attractive forces, that is, they accu-\nmulate at zero velocity.\n(2) In 1925, Einstein mentioned hydrogen, helium, and the electron gas as the\nbest possible candidates in which to observe his condensation phenomenon [E7].\n(3) In his 1925 paper, Einstein did not call the condensation phenomenon a\nphase transition.

It ends in January 1926\nwith Schroedinger's first paper on wave mechanics [SI]. The main purpose of this\nchapter is to stress Einstein's key role in these developments, his influence on de\nBroglie, de Broglie's subsequent influence on him, and, finally, the influence of\nboth on Schroedinger.\nNeither directly nor indirectly did Einstein contribute to an equally fundamen-\ntal development that preceded Schroedinger's discovery of wave mechanics: the\ndiscovery of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg [HI]. From Einstein to de Broglie\nDuring the period that began with Einstein's work on needle rays (1917) and\nended with Debye's and Gompton's papers on the Compton effect (1923), there\nwere a few other theoreticians also doing research on photon questions. That was in October 1923\u2014one month after his enunciation of the\nepochal new principle that particle-wave duality should apply not only to radia-\ntion but also to matter. 'After long reflection in solitude and meditation, I suddenly\nhad the idea, during the year 1923, that the discovery made by Einstein in 1905\nshould be generalized by extending it to all material particles and notably to elec-\ntrons' [B7].\nHe made the leap in his September 10, 1923, paper [Bl]: E = hv shall hold\nnot only for photons but also for electrons, to which he assigns a 'fictitious asso-\nciated wave. Einstein\nreceived a copy of this thesis from Langevin, who was one of de Broglie's exam-\niners. A letter to Lorentz (in December) shows that Einstein was impressed and\nalso that he had found a new application of de Broglie's ideas:\nA younger brother of . From de Broglie to Einstein\nIn 1909 and again in 1917, Einstein had drawn major conclusions about radiation\nfrom the study of fluctuations around thermal equilibrium.2)EINSTEIN AS A TRANSITIONAL FIGURE: THE BIRTH OF WAVE MECHANICS 437\nwhere Z(v) is the number of states per interval dv given in Eq. In his paper\nsubmitted on January 8, 1925, Einstein showed that Eq.\nWhen discussing radiation in 1909, Einstein recognized the second term of Eq.1 as the familiar wave term and the first one as the unfamiliar particle term.\nWhen in 1924 he revisited the fluctuation problem for the case of the quantum\ngas, he noted a reversal of roles. Since this term was associated\nwith waves in the case of radiation, Einstein was led to 'interpret it in a corre-\nsponding way for the gas, by associating with the gas a radiative phenomenon'\n[E2].'\nBut what were the waves.\nAt this point, Einstein turned to de Broglie's thesis [B7], 'a very notable pub-\nlication. He also remarked that the de Broglie\nwavefield had to be a scalar (the polarization factor is 2 for Eq.\nIt is another of Einstein's feats that he would be led to state the necessity of the\nexistence of matter waves from the analysis of fluctuations. One may wonder what\nthe history of twentieth century physics would have looked like had Einstein\npushed the analogy still further. However, with the achievement of an indepen-\ndent argument for the particle-wave duality of matter, the twenty-year period of\nhighest scientific creativity in Einstein's life, at a level probably never equalled,\ncame to an end. In the course of preparing this chapter, I noticed\na recollection by Pauli of a statement made by Einstein during a physics meeting\nheld in Innsbruck in 1924. According to Pauli, Einstein proposed in the course of\nthat meeting 'to search for interference and diffraction phenomena with molecular\nbeams' [PI]. Einstein arrived at the particle-wave duality of matter\nvia a route that was independent of the one taken by de Broglie. If Pauli's memory is correct, then Einstein made\nhis remark about two months prior to that time. Could he have come upon the\nwave properties of matter independently of de Broglie. After all, Einstein had\nbeen thinking about the molecular gas since July. The questions arise, When did\n438 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nEinstein become aware of de Broglie's work.\nDe Broglie does not believe that Einstein was aware of his three short publi-\ncations [Bl, B2, B3] written in 1923. 'I am certain that Einstein knew of my\nThese since the spring of 1924' [B9]. Langevin, probablement un peu etonne par la nouveaute\nde mes idees,* asked me to furnish him with a second typed copy of my These for\ntransmittal to Einstein. It was then that Einstein declared, after having read my\nwork, that my ideas seemed quite interesting to him.\nThus, Einstein was not only one of the three fathers of the quantum theory,\nbut also the sole godfather of wave mechanics. From de Broglie and Einstein to Schroedinger\nLate in 1925, Schroedinger completed an article entitled 'On Einstein's Gas The-\nory' [S2]. It was his last paper prior to his discovery of wave mechanics.\nEINSTEIN AS A TRANSITIONAL FIGURE: THE BIRTH OF WAVE MECHANICS 439\nby treating Einstein's molecular gas according to the Debye method. Now comes the key sentence in the article: 'That means\nnothing else but taking seriously the de Broglie-Einstein wave theory of moving\nparticles' [S2].\nSchroedinger's next paper was received on January 27, 1926 [SI]. Wave mechanics was born. In this new paper,\nSchroedinger acknowledged his debt to de Broglie and Einstein:\nI have recently shown [S2] that the Einstein gas theory can be founded on the\nconsideration of standing waves which obey the dispersion law of de Broglie.\nIn April 1926, Schroedinger again acknowledged the influence of de Broglie and\n'brief but infinitely far-seeing remarks by Einstein' [S3]. 20, 145 (1923). , preface to his reedited 1924 PhD thesis, Recherches sur la Theorie des\nQuanta, p.

Eugene Wigner, who was in Berlin in 1925, told me that Einstein had\nat that time the idea of wavefields serving as 'Fiihrungsfelder,' guiding fields, for\nlight-quanta or other particles, one field for each particle. During the very early days of quantum mechanics,*\nwe find him 'working strenuously on the further development of a theory on the\nconnection between gravitation and electricity' [E3]. Bose, who visited\nBerlin in November 1925, recalled that 'Einstein was very excited about the ne\nquantum mechanics.

How-\never, a number of letters from Heisenberg to Einstein are extant.

I\nfind it remarkable that Einstein apparently sensed that there was some connection\nbetween the BKS theory and quantum mechanics. Could Einstein have surmised as early as 1925 that some statistical element\nis inherent in the quantum mechanical description.\nDuring the following months, Einstein vacillated in his reaction to the Heisen-\nberg theory. In view of the scientific links between Einstein's and Schroe-\ndinger's work, it is not surprising that Einstein would express real enthusiasm\nabout wave mechanics: 'Schroedinger has come out with a pair of wonderful\npapers on the quantum rules', he wrote in May 1926 [E10]. [Bl]\nOne month later, Born wrote a more elaborate sequel to this paper, in which he\npointed out that the starting point of his considerations was 'a remark by Einstein\non the relation between [a] wavefield and light-quanta; he [E.\nEINSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO THE NEW DYNAMICS 443\nand spoke in this sense of a \"Gespensterfeld\"', ghost field [B2], clearly a reference\nto Einstein's idea of a Tuhrungsfeld.' Shortly thereafter, Born wrote to Einstein:\nMy idea to consider Schroedinger's wavefield as a 'Gespensterfeld' in your sense\nof the word proves to be more useful all the time. [B3]*\nOnce more, but now for the last time, we encounter Einstein as a transitional\nfigure in the period of the birth of quantum mechanics.** Einstein's position in the\nyears to follow can be summarized succinctly by saying that he took exception to\nevery single statement in Bern's papers and in the letter Born subsequently wrote\nto him. His earliest expressions of lasting dissent I know of date from December\n1926 and are, in fact, contained in his reply to one of Bern's letters: 'Quantum\nmechanics is very impressive.\n'Einstein's verdict . There are other\ninstances as well in which Einstein's reactions were experienced with a sense of\nloss, of being abandoned in battle by a venerated leader. Needless to say, Einstein's reactions affected the older generation more\nintensely than the younger. In a lecture given in Berlin, Einstein is reported to have said\nthat 'what nature demands from us is not a quantum theory or a wave theory;\nrather, nature demands from us a synthesis of these two views which thus far has\nexceeded the mental powers of physicists' [El2].

This letter is apparently in response\nto another lost letter by Einstein, triggered, most probably, by Heisenberg's work\nin March. Heisenberg had heard\nindirectly that Einstein 'had written a paper in which you . Einstein eventually withdrew his paper. As was mentioned in\nChapter 23, Einstein had declined an invitation to give a paper on quantum sta-\ntistics at that conference. Otto Stern has given this first-hand account**:\n\"This is the title of a paper Einstein submitted for the May 5, 1927, meeting of the Prussian Acad-\nemy in Berlin.

Between 1925 and 1931, the only objection by Einstein that\nappeared in print in the scientific literature is the one at the 1927 Solvay confer-\nence [E13]. I have written else-\nwhere about the profound role that the\" discussions with Einstein played in Bohr's\nlife [PI].\nThe record of the Solvay meeting contains only minor reactions to Einstein's\ncomments. Let us consider next the\nsubstance of Einstein's remarks.\nEinstein's opening phrase tells more about him than does many a book: 'Je dois\nm'excuser de n'avoir pas approfondi la mecanique des quanta,' I must apologize\nfor not having penetrated quantum mechanics deeply enough [El3]*.\nQuantum mechanics provides the following answer to Einstein's query. As we shall see, what was and is an\naccepted renunciation to others was an intolerable abdication in Einstein's eyes.\nI have dwelt at some length on this simple problem since it contains the germ\nof Einstein's position, which he stated more explicitly in later years. Meanwhile,\nthe debate in the corridors between Bohr and Einstein continued during the sixth\nSolvay Conference (on magnetism) in 1930. During\nthe whole evening he was extremely unhappy, going from one to the other and\ntrying to persuade them that it couldn't be true, that it would be the end of physics\nif Einstein were right; but he couldn't produce any refutation. This paper, a forerunner of\nthe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article to be discussed below, need not be remem-\nbered for its conclusions.\nA far more important expression of Einstein's opinions is found in a letter he\nwrote the following September.' Einstein had\nalready proposed Heisenberg and Schroedinger in 1928, and proposed Schroedinger again in 1932\n(see Chapter 31).\nDuring the last twenty-five years of life, Einstein maintained that quantum\nmechanics was incomplete.\nIn November 1931 Einstein gave a colloquium in Berlin 'on the uncertainty\nrelation' [El6]. The report of this talk does not state that Einstein objected to\nHeisenberg's relations. My friend Gasimir has written to me about a colloquium Einstein gave\nin Leiden, with Ehrenfest in the chair [Cl] (this must have been in November\n1930). In his talk, Einstein discussed several aspects of the clock-in-the-box exper-\niments. Einstein reacted to this statement as follows: 'Ich weiss es,\nwiderspruchsfrei ist die Sache schon, aber sie enthalt meines Erachtens doch eine\ngewisse Harte' (I know, this business is free of contradictions, yet in my view it\ncontains a certain unreasonableness).\nIt was in 1935 that Einstein stated his own desiderata for the first time in a\nprecise form. By 1935 Einstein was settled in Princeton. At this point, I\ninterrupt the account of the quantum theory in order to describe what happened\nto Einstein and his family from 1932 to 1945. Einstein at Princeton\nEinstein settled permanently in the United States in October 1933.\nEinstein's decision to move to Princeton was the result of three meetings with\nAbraham Flexner [Fl]. On that occasion, he\nwas introduced to Einstein. When they met again in Oxford, in the spring of 1932, Flexner asked if\nEinstein himself might be interested in joining the Institute.\nEinstein originally intended to spend five months of the year in Princeton and\nthe rest of the time in Berlin [K2]. The situation deteriorated rapidly, however, and in a letter dated\nMarch 28, 1933, Einstein sent his resignation to the Akademie in Berlin [K4]. They had to return to Europe because Einstein had obliga-\ntions and because arrangements had to be made for the move to Princeton, which\nnow, of course, was to be their only home.

It was to be Einstein's last home. This was Einstein's last trip outside the United States.\n**One biographer's story [C2] that Mayer had joined Einstein in England is incorrect.\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Einstein gave the Queen of Belgium\nhis early impressions of Princeton: 'A quaint ceremonious village of puny demi-\ngods on stilts' [E24].\nEinstein went on with his physics.\n454 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nDuring the years 1933-45 Einstein spoke out less on political issues than he\nhad done before or would do again after the war.\nMuch has been written about Einstein's letters to President Roosevelt on the\nimportance of the development of atomic weapons [E26].

Before returning to objective reality, I mention one anecdote of Einstein's early\nyears in the United States, a story I owe to Helen Dukas.\nDuring a speech by a high official at a major reception for Einstein, the honored\nguest took out his pen and started scribbling equations on the back of his program,\noblivious to everything.

Einstein tended to com-\npare the successes of classical mechanics with those of quantum mechanics.\nThe crux of Einstein's thinking on the quantum theory was not his negative\nposition in regard to what others had done, but rather his deep faith in his own\ndistinct approach to the quantum problems. [E2]\n(2) One should not try to find the new theory by beginning with quantum\nmechanics and trying to refine or reinterpret it:\nI do not believe that quantum mechanics will be the starting point in the search\nfor this basis, just as one cannot arrive at the foundations of mechanics from\nthermodynamics or statistical mechanics.

He was going to\ndo that again for the quantum theory, and never mind the time it might take.\n462 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nIt was a solitary position.\nEinstein's apartness in regard to the foundations of quantum physics predates\nthe discovery of quantum mechanics. I shall enlarge on this in Section 26c, but\nfirst some final Comments on the subject of Chapter 2: Einstein's general attitude\ntoward the quantum and relativity theories. Relativity Theory and Quantum Theory\nIt is a very striking characteristic of Einstein's early scientific writing that he left\nrelativity theory separate from quantum theory, even on occasions where it would\nhave been natural and straightforward to connect them. This separation is already\nevident in his very first paper on special relativity, in which he noted, 'It is remark-\nable that the energy and frequency of a light complex vary with the state of motion\nof the observer according to the same law' [E13]. Here was an obvious opportu-\nnity to refer to the relation E = hv of his paper on light-quanta, finished only a\nfew months earlier. Also, in the September 1905\npaper on relativity [El4], he referred to radiation but not to light-quanta. In his\n1909 address at Salzburg, Einstein discussed his ideas both on relativity theory\nand on quantum theory but kept these two areas well separated [El 5]. As we saw\nin Section 21c, in his 1917 paper Einstein ascribed to light-quanta an energy E\n= hv and a momentum p = hv/c. Because, I believe, to him relativity was to such an extent the revealed\ntruth that in his view the phenomenological and provisional quantum theory was\nnot yet ripe enough, perhaps not yet worthy enough, to be brought into contact\nwith relativity arguments.\nSo it was in the days of the old quantum theory. So it remained after quantum\nmechanics came along. In the previous section, I noted that Einstein considered\nquantum mechanics to be highly successful. I should now be more precise and add\nthat this opinion of his applied exclusively to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nI know from experience how difficult it was to discuss quantum field theory with\nhim. He did not believe that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics provided a secure\nenough basis for relativistic generalizations [E17, E18]. Relativistic quantum field\ntheory was repugnant to him [Blj. Walter Thirring has written to me of conver-\nsations with Einstein in which 'his objections became even stronger when it con-\ncerned quantum field theory, and he did not believe in any of its consequences'\n[Tl]. Valentin Bargmann has told me that at one time Einstein asked him for a\nprivate survey of quantum field theory, beginning with second quantization.\nThe preceding remarks on quantum field theory refer principally to its special\nrelativistic version. In the time capsule of Section 2b, I inserted the comment that\nto this day the synthesis of quantum theory and general relativity is beset with\nconceptual difficulties. an indirect description of Reality, even if the [quantum] theory can befitted\nsuccessfully to the General Relativity postulates [my italics]. [E19]\n'That programme' is uniquely Einstein's. His main point was that one should not\nstart out by accepting the quantum postulates as primary rules and then proceed\nto fit these rules to general relativity. Instead, he believed one should start with a\nclassical field theory, a unified field theory, and demand of that theory that the\nquantum rules should emerge as constraints imposed by that theory itself. the constructions of his\n464 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nimagination appear so necessary and so natural that he is apt to treat them not as\nthe creations of his thoughts but as given realities' [E4].\nFinally, I should like to reiterate my own view that Einstein's technical objec-\ntions to quantum mechanics are unfounded, but that I do not know whether either\nquantum mechanics or general relativity is complete, or whether their desired syn-\nthesis can be consummated simply by welding together their respective sets of\npostulates. Uberkausalitat\nIn 1923 Einstein published an article entitled 'Does field theory offer possibilities\nfor the solution of the quantum problem. However, Einstein continued,\nthis method cannot be applied to quantum problems without further ado. Then he asked, Can one nevertheless implement these quantum\nconstraints in a (causal) theory based on partial differential equations.\nEINSTEIN'S VISION 465\nOverdetermination was and remained Einstein's hope for an answer to the\nquantum problem. In addressing Planck, six years later, he made his point quite\nemphatically: the understanding of quantum phenomena does not demand a\nweakening of classical causality, as is done in quantum mechanics. He demanded that the theory shall be strictly causal,\nthat it shall unify gravitation and electromagnetism, that the particles of physics\nshall emerge as special solutions of the general field equations, and that the quan-\ntum postulates shall be a consequence of the general field equations. Einstein had\nall these criteria in mind when he wrote, in 1949, 'Our problem is that of finding\nthe field equations of the total field' [E3]. Einstein's scientific evolution can there-\nfore be schematized by the picture given in the preface:\nSpecial relativity Statistical physics\nI I\nGeneral relativity Quantum theory\n^ Unified \"^\nfield theory\nIn Chapter 171 discussed that portion of Einstein's work on unified field theory\nthat dealt with the synthesis of gravitation and electromagnetism. Here I add a\nfew remarks on the quantum aspects.\nEinstein's correspondence shows that the unified field theory and the quantum\nproblems were very often simultaneously on his mind. In 1925, while he was at work on a theory with a nonsymmetric metric, he\nwrote to a friend, 'Now the question is whether this field theory is compatible\nwith the existence of atoms and quanta. statistical\n[quantum] theory .\n466 THE QUANTUM THEORY\nForever and in vain, Einstein kept looking for hints that would help him realize\nhis vision of a quantum theory derived from a unified field theory. This urge\nexplains his reference to the quantum theory at unexpected places. the quantum\ntheory' [E28]. In 1930\nhe gave a lecture on unified field theory, a report of which contains the statement,\n'He emphasized that he is in no way taking notice of the results of quantum cal-\nculations because he believes that by dealing with microscopic phenomena these\nwill come out by themselves' [E30]. A report in 1931 by Einstein on a five-dimen-\nsional theory which should unify gravitation and electromagnetism ends, 'This\ntheory does not yet contain the conclusions of the quantum theory' [E31]. One phrase in this paper, 'one does not see\na priori whether the theory contains the quantum phenomena' illustrates once\nagain the scope of the program that was on Einstein's mind. Gravitation and electromagnetism were not synthesized,\nquantum physics was not integrated, satisfactory particle-like solutions were not\nfound.\nAs early as 1927, Heisenberg stressed, in a letter to Einstein, that the latter's\nconcept of simplicity and the simplicity inherent in quantum mechanics cannot be\nrealized at the same time. 'If I have understood correctly your point of view, then\nyou would gladly sacrifice the simplicity [of quantum mechanics] to the principle\nof [classical] causality.\n'The theory of relativity and the quantum theory .* To his dear friend Besso he wrote in 1954,\n'I consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept, i. are in part due to the\nconjecture that a sensible general relativistic [classical] field theory might per-\nhaps provide the key to a more complete quantum theory.

My sole focus will be upon matters of great historical interest:\nthe scientific judgments of leading physicists who made the proposals and the judg-\n502\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 503\nment of a highly responsible, rather conservative body of great prestige, the Com-\nmittee. It read, 'Nobelpreis fur Physik ihnen zuerkannt naheres brieflich [signed]\nAurivillius. Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al]. Bohr had been awarded the physics prize for\n1922. At that time, he promised that he would give her the money\nhe was to receive when his Nobel prize came.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. for physics awarded to you more by letter.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI].\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. The 1916\nphysics prize was never awarded. Bohr, Paschen, Planck, Sommerfeld; (prize deferred;\n1917 prize goes to Barkla). Knudsen, Lehmann, Planck; (Stark; also, 1918\nprize goes to Planck). Same as 1920; (prize deferred). On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize. Ostwald, winner of the chemistry prize for 1909, the only\none to propose Einstein for 1910, repeated his nominations for the 1912 and 1913\nawards. Pringsheim wrote,\n'I believe that the Nobel Committee will rarely have the opportunity of awarding\na prize for works of similar significance' [PI].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507\nBefore turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions\nof the Committee to the earlier ones. In the Report for 1910, it was suggested that\none should wait for further experimental verification 'before one can accept the\n[relativity] principle and in particular award it a Nobel prize. He was not nominated for the 1915 prize. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Gehrcke, one of the leaders of the 'Arbeitsgemeinschaft\nDeutscher Naturforscher' (Chapter 16). In 1921 Lenard proposed Gehrcke for the Nobel\nprize.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. In 1910 and\nagain in 1911, he was proposed for the Nobel prize in physics. 'In 1911 the orig-\ninal suggestion from the Committee was that the prize should be given to Professor\nA.\nI quote from its summary, found in the Report for 1921.*\nThe main points of Arrhenius's report were first, that a prize for quantum\ntheory had just been given (Planck, 1918) and second, that it would be preferable\nto give an award to experimentalists if the photoeffect were to be honored.\nNo prize for physics was given that year. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 511\nA further exchange between Gullstrand and Kretschmann settled their differ-\nences to mutual satisfaction [K3].\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity.\nWas the photoeffect worth a Nobel prize.

January 19, 1921. In his letter, Einstein lauds\nMasaryk for his role in protecting oppressed minorities, especially the Czechs and\nthe Jews, and adds, 'I am convinced that awarding him the Nobel prize would\nrepresent a beautiful victory for international reconciliation. October 26, 1923.'\nIn 1925 the physics prize is awarded to Franck and Hertz. May 22, 1925. September 28, 1927.'\nIn 1927 the physics prize is awarded to Compton and Wilson. February 15, 1928. Dr Heinrich Meng from Stuttgart, editor of Zeit-\nschrift fur Psychoanalytische Pddagogik, and author Stefan Zweig (then in Salz-\nburg) have written to a number of prominent figures urging them to support the\nnomination of Freud for the Nobel prize. Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl].) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930. With respect to achievement, each one of these\ninvestigators deserves a full Nobel prize although their theories in the main coin-\ncide in regard to reality content.' In 1937,' Davisson shares the prize with G. September 20, 1931. The achievements of both men are independent of each other and so signif-\nicant that it would not be appropriate to divide a Nobel prize between them. If I had to decide, I would give the prize first\nto Schroedinger. No physics prize is awarded in 1931.\nThe Nobel committee for physics decides to drop the 1931 prize altogether and\nto postpone the 1932 award until 1933. 'Formally speak-\ning, I have no right to propose a candidate for the Nobel peace prize,' but, he\nadds, his conscience demands that he write anyway.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem.\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 517\nhim for the peace prize, initiated in 1934, grew into an international campaign.\nIn January 1936, more than 500 members of the parliaments of Czechoslovakia,\nEngland, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland signed petitions\nnominating him for the peace prize. In November 1936 he was awarded the peace prize for 1935.\nOn January 30, 1937, Hitler decreed that no German was henceforth permitted\nto receive Nobel prizes of any kind. The Nobel committee nevertheless awarded\nto Germans the chemistry prize in 1938 and the medicine prize in 1939. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. The letter appears to\nbe in response to an earlier letter by Johnson concerning the possibility of a Nobel\nprize for literature for Hermann Broch.\nIn 1954 Bothe and Born share the physics prize. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.'\nThe peace prize for 1954 is awarded to the office of the U.\nEINSTEIN'S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 519\nE2.

Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909. Einstein\nat the laboratory of the University of Zurich,' in which Einstein's idea was real-\nized with the help of a set of six rotating condensers [H2]. Einstein still continued\nto take a lively interest in the project after his own work had gone in other direc-\ntions. Hopf arranged a meeting between\nEinstein and Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst [SI]. Assistant to Einstein in Prague. 'The many hours Einstein and my\nfather spent together in Einstein's study, his world view and character left a lasting\nimpression on my father.

The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-\neral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21]. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists. He first met Einstein in 1915. The meeting came about because of a chance\nencounter between the Miihsams and Elsa Einstein. The membrane consists of the walls of a tube that is open at one\n'Einstein's article on Ehrenfest was originally published in the Almanak van het Leidsche Studen-\ntencorps in 1934.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 489\nend. Tor a long period, Einstein visited us daily in Berlin' [M2]. Mrs\nMiihsam wrote to Seelig after her husband's death, 'Do you know that Einstein\nonce said to me, \"First comes your husband, then for a long while comes nothing,\nand only then come all other people\". I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. It was to\nMiihsam that Einstein told the story of having, at age twelve, composed songs in\nhonor of God which he would sing to himself on his way to school [S5] (see Chap-\nter 3). Muhsam could have informed us better than anyone\nelse about personal events which may well have contributed to Einstein's becoming\na figure who went his lonely separate way in physics after 1926. A letter from\nEinstein in 1942 still shows personal touches: 'I have become a lonely old chap\nwho is mainly known because he does not wear socks and who is exhibited as a\ncuriosum on special occasions' [E27]. I believe\nit was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-\nics. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent\noffice in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928).* Briefly, the task Einstein and Szilard had set for themselves was to devise\na noiseless household refrigerator. An acquaintance of Einstein, a\ndistinguished singer, had become hard of hearing. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-\nschmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. Einstein's\naddress is given as 'Earlier in Berlin, present residence unknown.'\nGoldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-\nrespondence with Einstein, d.\nLanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over\na dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. A week later, Lanczos wrote\nto Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4].\nEinstein refers to Lanczos' work in one of his articles on distant parallelism [E31],\na subject on which Lanczos wrote a review two years later [L5].\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35]. In October\nEinstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which\na new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-\ntime continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point\n[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493\nham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-\nment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-\ntion. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work . The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. During Einstein's second visit to California,\nhe published a joint note with de Sitter [E48] in which a cosmologically flat uni-\nverse is proposed (without cosmological term and with zero pressure), d. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. I was sure that Einstein had not\ndone the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function\ninstead. The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. The little man with the pince-nez must have replied to the good\nprofessor, for shortly afterward Einstein wrote again to Molotov to thank him for\nhis help [E56]. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote\nabout his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3]. Einstein wrote an introduction\nto Bergmann's textbook on relativity [E65].\nBargmann and Einstein published two papers together, the one with Bergmann\njust mentioned [E64] and a paper on bivectors [E66]. Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]\non relativity theory. 1922, Munich. Assistant to Einstein 1944-8. Two\nexamples of such generalizations (about which Einstein never published) are\nfound in Straus's reminiscences [Wl].\n\"Einstein also wrote a sequel to this paper [E67].\nfThis is an improved version of an earlier result obtained by Einstein alone [E70].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 497\nwithout awareness of numerous earlier contributions to this subject by others\n[E72].

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. In Novem-\nber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein. On December 4 he received a telegram from the Prussian Academy:\n'Antwort: Einstein ist Reichsdeutscher. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,\nthough he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien). Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E. As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. Einstein was deeply\nimmersed in the struggle with general relativity and was confusing everybody,\nincluding himself, with his hybrid theory in which everything was covariant\nexcept the gravitational field equations. The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] . Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics.' Also beside\nthe mark is his finding about the general theory: 'As Gullstrand has shown, the\nsituation is that it remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein\ntheory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion experiment [. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

In response to another request for a nomination in phys-\nics, Einstein writes that he finds it difficult to make one definite proposal.\n**The references given in [PI] and [P2] occur explicitly in Einstein's letters. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies\nto Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-\nnot decide to intervene in the present case.'\nUpon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a\nletter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-\ninitely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals. Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. I mention here one\nadditional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:\n'The old one had . I leave, of course, to myself and\nto my readers all attempts to analyse what this statement reveals about Freud and\nabout Einstein. This is the first of three letters in which Einstein\nfocuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. It is significant that neither\nin 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac. Einstein is now convinced that quantum mechanics\nwill survive.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,\nProfessor E.\n[Here Einstein adds a footnote: This, however, is only my own opinion, which\nmay be wrong. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the\nEnglishman Herbert Runham Brown. Schroedinger\nfrom Berlin. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'\npeace prize proposals.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem. Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers.

Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-\ngang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory\nconsisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of\nmodern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that\ntheory stop Albert Einstein. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. Einstein writes that he has no insight and\nunderstanding concerning modern literature.\nHe and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue\nto award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -\nGeiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.\nIt has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to\nStockholm proposing A.

Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.\nAll of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the\nformative stages of their development. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909. Einstein\nat the laboratory of the University of Zurich,' in which Einstein's idea was real-\nized with the help of a set of six rotating condensers [H2]. Assistant to Einstein in Prague.

The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-\neral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21]. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists.

Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote\nabout his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3].

A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2].

For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E. The comments on relativity\nin the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize.\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] .\n1920. A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein.

Since I was about to take a\nterm's leave from Princeton, I called Helen Dukas and asked her to be kind\nenough to give my best wishes to Professor Einstein. After I\narrived, I went upstairs and knocked at the door of Einstein's study.\n479\nThis page intentionally left blank VIII\nAPPENDICES\nThis page intentionally left blank 29\nOf Tensors and a Hearing Aid\nand Many Other Things:\nEinstein's Collaborators\nAll of Einstein's major papers are his alone. Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 485\nstein was quite excited about his invention, and at one time must have even con-\nsidered patenting it.

Einstein attempted to help Nohel but without success\n[E12]. PhD in\n1912 in physical chemistry with Otto Sackur in Breslau. Fellow student of Einstein at the\nETH, 1896-1900.\nIn 1905 Einstein dedicated his PhD thesis to the younger Grossmann. Einstein remembered Grossmann with gratitude in his last autobiograph-\nical sketch [E14].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 487\n9. Fokker worked with Einstein in Zurich dur-\ning the winter semester in 1913-14.\nLorentz) went to Berlin, where he worked first in the laboratory of Henri du Bois\nand then with Einstein at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt. The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists. He first met Einstein in 1915.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 489\nend. I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. Muhsam could have informed us better than anyone\nelse about personal events which may well have contributed to Einstein's becoming\na figure who went his lonely separate way in physics after 1926. I believe\nit was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-\nics. PhD in Berlin in 1922\nwith von Laue.\nEinstein and Szilard made a considerable number of joint patent applications,\neight German (November 1927-December 1930), six British (December 1927-\nDecember 1929), one U. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent\noffice in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928). All the German pat-\n490 APPENDICES\nents were awarded after Einstein had left that country. In 1927 Einstein autho-\nrized Szilard to apply in his own name for patents abroad of some of their joint\nventures [E28]. Rudolf Goldschmidt.\n**I am grateful to Professor Goldschmidt's daugther-in-law Rose Goldie from New Maiden, Surrey,\nEngland, and to Horst Melcher from Potsdam for information which was of great help to me in the\npreparation of this note on the Einstein-Goldschmidt patent. I first became aware of this patent\nthrough Professor Melcher's papers [M4, M5],\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 491\nused in the first radiotelegraphic link between Germany and the United States,\nopened on June 19, 1914, with an exchange of telegrams between Wilhelm II and\nWoodrow Wilson. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-\nschmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her.'\nGoldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-\nrespondence with Einstein, d. PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work . Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,\nwhen the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c). The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. A member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1935-7. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3].

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al]. Bohr had been awarded the physics prize for\n1922.\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923. At that time, he promised that he would give her the money\nhe was to receive when his Nobel prize came.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. for physics awarded to you more by letter. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El]. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Some physicists also\nsigned: M. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien).\n(Lorentz, who shared the 1902 prize with Zeeman, was nominated by Wien for\na prize to be shared with Einstein. Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). The 1916\nphysics prize was never awarded. Bohr, Debye, Nernst, Planck, Sommerfeld;\n(prize deferred). Bohr, Paschen, Planck, Sommerfeld; (prize deferred;\n1917 prize goes to Barkla). Knudsen, Lehmann, Planck; (Stark; also, 1918\nprize goes to Planck). Mathematical physics. Same as 1920; (prize deferred). Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). Ostwald, winner of the chemistry prize for 1909, the only\none to propose Einstein for 1910, repeated his nominations for the 1912 and 1913\nawards. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E. Pringsheim wrote,\n'I believe that the Nobel Committee will rarely have the opportunity of awarding\na prize for works of similar significance' [PI].\nWien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and\nLorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein\nand Lorentz).\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507\nBefore turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions\nof the Committee to the earlier ones. In the Report for 1910, it was suggested that\none should wait for further experimental verification 'before one can accept the\n[relativity] principle and in particular award it a Nobel prize. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] . A letter dated January 24,\n1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the\ntheory of gravitation. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In 1921 Lenard proposed Gehrcke for the Nobel\nprize.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. In 1910 and\nagain in 1911, he was proposed for the Nobel prize in physics. 'In 1911 the orig-\ninal suggestion from the Committee was that the prize should be given to Professor\nA.\" So Gull-\nstrand declined the prize in physics, and the Committee wrote an extra report\n(now including Gullstrand among the signers) suggesting Wien for the prize'\n[Nl].*\nThe main points of Arrhenius's report were first, that a prize for quantum\ntheory had just been given (Planck, 1918) and second, that it would be preferable\nto give an award to experimentalists if the photoeffect were to be honored.\nNo prize for physics was given that year. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2].\nPlanck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,\nrespectively.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.\nThat is how Einstein got the Nobel prize 'for his services to theoretical physics\nand especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 511\nA further exchange between Gullstrand and Kretschmann settled their differ-\nences to mutual satisfaction [K3].\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was.\nWas the photoeffect worth a Nobel prize. The order of awards for quantum\nphysics was perfect: first Planck, then Einstein, then Bohr. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

In September 1918 Einstein received a request from Stockholm\nfor a nomination in physics for the year 1919.\nOn November 13, 1919, Planck is awarded the physics prize for 1918. Einstein endorses the proposal of the Czech parliament\nto give the peace prize to Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the first president (from 1918\nto 1935) of the young nation of Czechoslovakia. In his letter, Einstein lauds\nMasaryk for his role in protecting oppressed minorities, especially the Czechs and\nthe Jews, and adds, 'I am convinced that awarding him the Nobel prize would\nrepresent a beautiful victory for international reconciliation.'\nIn 1925 the physics prize is awarded to Franck and Hertz. Einstein proposes the famous Brazilian explorer Marshal\nCandido Mariano da Silva Rondon for the peace prize.'\nIn 1927 the physics prize is awarded to Compton and Wilson. Dr Heinrich Meng from Stuttgart, editor of Zeit-\nschrift fur Psychoanalytische Pddagogik, and author Stefan Zweig (then in Salz-\nburg) have written to a number of prominent figures urging them to support the\nnomination of Freud for the Nobel prize. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies\nto Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-\nnot decide to intervene in the present case.'\nUpon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a\nletter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-\ninitely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals. Much more revealing information is\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515\nfound in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. 'In my opinion, the most\nimportant and not yet rewarded achievement in physics is the insight into the wave\nnature of mechanical processes.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. Heisenberg from\nLeipzig. The achievements of both men are independent of each other and so signif-\nicant that it would not be appropriate to divide a Nobel prize between them. If I had to decide, I would give the prize first\nto Schroedinger. No physics prize is awarded in 1931. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the\nEnglishman Herbert Runham Brown.\nThe Nobel committee for physics decides to drop the 1931 prize altogether and\nto postpone the 1932 award until 1933. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'\npeace prize proposals.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a\nhistoric act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem. Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers.\nEINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 517\nhim for the peace prize, initiated in 1934, grew into an international campaign. The Nobel committee nevertheless awarded\nto Germans the chemistry prize in 1938 and the medicine prize in 1939. Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-\ngang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory\nconsisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of\nmodern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that\ntheory stop Albert Einstein. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it\nquite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]\nand I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any\nperson. Einstein writes to Dr Alvin Johnson, president emeritus\nof The New School for Social Research in New York City.\nHe and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein proposes Friedrich Wilhelm Forster for the\npeace prize: 'It might be difficult to find people who have actually been successful\nin their efforts to secure peace. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue\nto award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -\nGeiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution.\nIn 1954 Bothe and Born share the physics prize. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the\nhonor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the\nNobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through\nwhich children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.\nIt has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to\nStockholm proposing A.

Since I was about to take a\nterm's leave from Princeton, I called Helen Dukas and asked her to be kind\nenough to give my best wishes to Professor Einstein. After I\narrived, I went upstairs and knocked at the door of Einstein's study.\n479\nThis page intentionally left blank VIII\nAPPENDICES\nThis page intentionally left blank 29\nOf Tensors and a Hearing Aid\nand Many Other Things:\nEinstein's Collaborators\nAll of Einstein's major papers are his alone. Einstein did not like\ncrowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved\nto talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the\nEinstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-\nativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.\nAll of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the\nformative stages of their development. Along with the younger physicists\nwho came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his\nown generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,\nBucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,\nwas already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-\nthermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of\nconcern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein.\nTo understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize\na reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which\nthe nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what\nbecame of the people who worked with Einstein. I do not\ninclude men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied\nor followed by a joint enterprise.\n**See also [PI] for an account of Einstein's earliest scientific collaborations. Laub published on special relativity as early as 1907\n[LI]. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could\nwork with him [L2]. Ritz and Einstein published one very brief\njoint paper, written in April 1909.\nAs the result of a note on voltage fluctations in a condenser, 'a phenomenon\nsimilar to Brownian motion' [E3], that Einstein wrote in 1907, he became inter-\nested in the possibility of amplifying small voltage differences. Einstein\nat the laboratory of the University of Zurich,' in which Einstein's idea was real-\nized with the help of a set of six rotating condensers [H2]. Einstein still continued\nto take a lively interest in the project after his own work had gone in other direc-\ntions. Hopf\nmet Einstein in September 1909 at the Salzburg physics meeting and soon joined\nhim at the University of Zurich as his assistant. Hopf arranged a meeting between\nEinstein and Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst [SI]. Assistant to Einstein in Prague. 'The many hours Einstein and my\nfather spent together in Einstein's study, his world view and character left a lasting\nimpression on my father. He was fond of Einstein's first wife and regretted\ntheir separation. Einstein attempted to help Nohel but without success\n[E12]. Marcel Grossmann. Fellow student of Einstein at the\nETH, 1896-1900. Grossmann and his\nfather were instrumental in getting Einstein appointed to the patent office in Bern.\nIn 1905 Einstein dedicated his PhD thesis to the younger Grossmann. Einstein remembered Grossmann with gratitude in his last autobiograph-\nical sketch [E14].\n**For other biographical details about Grossmann, see [Kl] and [S3].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 487\n9. Fokker worked with Einstein in Zurich dur-\ning the winter semester in 1913-14.\nLorentz) went to Berlin, where he worked first in the laboratory of Henri du Bois\nand then with Einstein at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt.\nGrommer worked with Einstein for ten years, the longest period any person\ncollaborated with him. The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on\ncosmology [E17]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in\none of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully\nassisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity\n\"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee\nthat was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl]. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. 'Paul\nEhrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,\nwas written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever\nknown.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and\nphysicists. He first met Einstein in 1915.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 489\nend. Tor a long period, Einstein visited us daily in Berlin' [M2]. I have reasons to believe that\nMiihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. Muhsam could have informed us better than anyone\nelse about personal events which may well have contributed to Einstein's becoming\na figure who went his lonely separate way in physics after 1926. A letter from\nEinstein in 1942 still shows personal touches: 'I have become a lonely old chap\nwho is mainly known because he does not wear socks and who is exhibited as a\ncuriosum on special occasions' [E27]. In that same letter, he also writes about his\nwork: 'In regard to work, I am more fanatic than ever and really hope to have\nsolved my old problem of the unity of the physical field. I believe\nit was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-\nics. PhD in Berlin in 1922\nwith von Laue. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent\noffice in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928). In 1927 Einstein autho-\nrized Szilard to apply in his own name for patents abroad of some of their joint\nventures [E28]. Rudolf Goldschmidt.\n**I am grateful to Professor Goldschmidt's daugther-in-law Rose Goldie from New Maiden, Surrey,\nEngland, and to Horst Melcher from Potsdam for information which was of great help to me in the\npreparation of this note on the Einstein-Goldschmidt patent. I first became aware of this patent\nthrough Professor Melcher's papers [M4, M5],\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 491\nused in the first radiotelegraphic link between Germany and the United States,\nopened on June 19, 1914, with an exchange of telegrams between Wilhelm II and\nWoodrow Wilson. An acquaintance of Einstein, a\ndistinguished singer, had become hard of hearing. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-\nschmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. Einstein's\naddress is given as 'Earlier in Berlin, present residence unknown.'\nGoldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-\nrespondence with Einstein, d. PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.\nLanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over\na dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. In 1928,\nEinstein wrote to Erwin Madelung in Frankfurt am Main, asking if it would be\npossible for Lanczos to have a year's leave of absence from his position as an\nassistant and Privatdozent at the University of Frankfurt in order to work with\nEinstein on problems in unified field theory [E30]. A week later, Lanczos wrote\nto Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4]. Hermann Miintz.\n492 APPENDICES\nwith Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant\nparallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-\neration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'\n[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.* Einstein acknowledged Miintz's work in two papers on distant\nparallelism [E31, E33].\nAfter the departure of Lanczos and Miintz, Einstein contacted Richard von\nMises in Vienna to ask if he knew of someone interested in working with him. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to\nkeep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig\nBieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35]. In October\nEinstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which\na new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-\ntime continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point\n[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their\nfirst trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish\nto interrupt the collaboration. It deals with semi-vectors and spinors\n[E38] and was the last paper published by Einstein in the Sitzungsberichte of the\nPreussische Akademie.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493\nham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-\nment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-\ntion. After other conditions of his professorship had been settled to mutual\nsatisfaction, Einstein wrote to Flexner, 'Now my only wish is that Herr Dr W. At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment\nhad still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise\ncare in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A\nsubsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he\nwanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted\na chair at Madrid University.\nThe very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration\nwith Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer\narrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would\nseverely impair our joint work .\nEinstein prevailed, and Mayer was given a tenured position with the title of\nassociate, the only appointment of its kind ever made by the Institute. The entire\ncollaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint\npaper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. Professor at California Institute\nof Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During\nEinstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-\nsky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein\nand Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics [E47]. Podolsky met Einstein\nin Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,\nwhen the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c). I was sure that Einstein had not\ndone the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function\ninstead. The first\njoint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which\ncame from Rosen.\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495\nment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin\nInstitute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the\nPhysical Review again. At\nthat time Rosen was in the Soviet Union, where Einstein had helped him to obtain\na temporary position. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-\nogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein. Leopold Infeld. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and\ncorresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to\na popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute\nfor Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles\n[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being\nthe well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In\n1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book\nwritten to help Infeld financially [E61]. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. In 1929 Hoffmann\nstarted work on projective relativity with Veblen. A member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1935-7. Hoffmann\nco-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has\nbeen professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of\n496 APPENDICES\nan excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,\nof a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3]. PhD in 1936 in Prague with\nPhilipp Frank, who recommended him to Einstein. Einstein wrote an introduction\nto Bergmann's textbook on relativity [E65]. Member of The Institute for Advanced Study 1937-46.\nBargmann and Einstein published two papers together, the one with Bergmann\njust mentioned [E64] and a paper on bivectors [E66]. Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]\non relativity theory. Ernst Gabor Straus, b. Assistant to Einstein 1944-8. At\nthe time Straus came to work with Einstein, the latter was much interested in the\nproblem of finding generalizations of general relativity that are not based on dif-\nferential geometry. Two\nexamples of such generalizations (about which Einstein never published) are\nfound in Straus's reminiscences [Wl].\n\"Einstein also wrote a sequel to this paper [E67].\nfThis is an improved version of an earlier result obtained by Einstein alone [E70].\nEINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 497\nwithout awareness of numerous earlier contributions to this subject by others\n[E72].

Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-\nvillius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have\nalready informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-\nemy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,\nin consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the\nvalue which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these\nare confirmed in the future' [Al].\nEinstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. Einstein\nleft anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923.\nOn December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,\naccepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet\nheld in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again\none of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind. In Novem-\nber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein. On December 4 he received a telegram from the Prussian Academy:\n'Antwort: Einstein ist Reichsdeutscher. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-\nemy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had\ntaken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans\ncan be state officials. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and\nreiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this\nvisit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the\nPrussian Academy reads in part, '[R.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the\nNobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the\nmedal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be\ndone via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-\nfessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El]. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general\nlecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your\nrelativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,\nthough he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very\nhot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of\nabout two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems\nof the theory of relativity' [E3].\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 505\nchat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical\nlecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science\nSociety.\nThe records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the\nphysics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915. For each year in the\nfollowing synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,\nthe company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the\nyear. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien). Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize). Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the\n1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.\nWho nominated Einstein.\nThe first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to\nwhom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of\n1901 (see Chapter 3). On the third occasion, he emphasized that the\nissues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-\ngested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-\nwin [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E.\nWien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and\nLorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein\nand Lorentz). As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908\nsome experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation. This [need for fur-\nther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein\nwas proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and\ncaused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on\nBrownian motion had gained him great recognition. In the\nReport for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a\nserious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be\nconsiderable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my\nown comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise\nat not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn\n(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several\ndomains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may\ntake a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity\nand his other work. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special\nand general relativity. The third and last letter that year,\nby Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written\n[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose\nwork represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes\nEinstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then\nthe two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-\ntoelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's\nexperimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-\nicist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental\nsnag: The measurements of C. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-\nory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von\nLaue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;\nEdgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;\n508 APPENDICES\nStefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the\nspecial and the general theory).\nPlanck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step\nbeyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. The Report goes in detail into statistical\nproblems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work\non critical opalescence. 'It would\nundoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the\nprize for [statistical physics] . Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. Einstein 'has placed himself in the\nfirst rank of physicists of all time.\nAppended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the\nrequest of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity.* The Com-\nmittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the\naward. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein.\nHOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509\nHaas and Warburg are also back. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Hadamard (Paris) proposes either Einstein or Perrin. Lyman (Harvard)\ncites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Eddington writes, 'Einstein\nstands above his contemporaries even as Newton did' [E5]. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what\nthe general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not\nappear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2]. Poulton (Oxford).\nOseen, the theoretical physicist, gives an excellent analysis of Einstein's paper\nof 1905 on the light-quantum as well as of his work in 1909 on energy fluctuations\nin blackbody radiation.\nThe Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize.' That is also\nwhy Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not\nbased on relativity.\nIn his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-\ncussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. The editors did not include\nhis book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came\nto know, like, and respect Bergson. It is not more than my guess that he\nmight have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed\nto in a quite different context: the bending of light.\nWhy did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity. Leading physicists had\nrecognized him for what he was. It is a touching twist\nof history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein\nfor the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics. Einstein, November 10, 1922.

In September 1918 Einstein received a request from Stockholm\nfor a nomination in physics for the year 1919. In response to another request for a nomination in phys-\nics, Einstein writes that he finds it difficult to make one definite proposal.\n**The references given in [PI] and [P2] occur explicitly in Einstein's letters. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies\nto Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-\nnot decide to intervene in the present case.'\nUpon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a\nletter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-\ninitely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals. I mention here one\nadditional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:\n'The old one had . This is the first of three letters in which Einstein\nfocuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-\nlently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)\nshould be considered (for 1930.'\nAs further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie\nand Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. It is significant that neither\nin 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,\nProfessor E.

Efforts to nominate\n*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]\n**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by\nothers.
