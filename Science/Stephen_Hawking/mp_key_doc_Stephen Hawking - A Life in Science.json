This initiallymodest readjustment of their world view grew, like an avalanchetriggered by a snowball rolling down a hill, to become a revolutionthat engulfed the whole of physics\u2014the quantum revolution. In the quantum world (the world of the verysmall, on the scale of atoms and below), particles and waves are  sim-ply twin facets of allentities.\u201d The dual description of particles aswaves and waves as particles turned out to be the key to unlockingthe secrets of the quantum world, leading to the development of asatisfactory theory to account for the behavior of atoms, particles,and light. The German physicist WernerHeisenberg established in the 1920s that all observable quantitiesare subject, on the quantum scale, to random variations in theirsize, with the magnitude of these variations determined by Planck\u2019sconstant. But there is something muchmore important to our everyday lives inherent in quantum physics.By introducing uncertainty and probability into the equations,quantum physics does away once and for all with the predictiveclockwork of Newtonian determinism. Quantum physics explained how atoms and molecules workand gave an insight into the nature of light and other forms of radi-ation.

Nevertheless, the special theory, which was published in1905, contributed a key ingredient to the new understanding of theUniverse. Before we move on to this, though, we should at least givea brief outline of the main features of the special theory. \nEinstein developed the special theory of relativity in response to\na puzzle that had emerged from nineteenth-century science. \nEinstein resolved the dilemma with his special theory. The special theory of relativity is no exception tothis rule. \nIn essence, the special theory is the result of a marriage of\nNewton\u2019s equations of motion with Maxwell\u2019s equations describingradiation. It was very much a child of its time, and if Einstein hadn\u2019tcome up with the theory in 1905, one of his contemporaries wouldsurely have done so within the next few years.

But the essence of cosmology is still mathematics,which means that cosmological ideas can be expressed in terms ofequations written down using pencil and paper.

And if the Universe can be likened to a cosmicclockwork machine, who wound up the clockwork and set it going. \nStrangely, though, in Newton\u2019s day, and down into the twentieth\ncentury, science did not really contemplate the notion of a beginningto the Universe at all. The Universe at large was perceived as eternaland unchanging, with \u201cfixed\u201d stars hanging in space. A static universe will soonstart to collapse under the pull of gravity. But that became clear onlyafter Einstein had developed a new theory of gravity\u2014a theory,moreover, which contained within itself a prediction that theUniverse would certainly not be static and might actually be not col-lapsing but expanding. Nevertheless, the special theory, which was published in1905, contributed a key ingredient to the new understanding of theUniverse. And they explained the\u201cconstancy\u201d of the speed of light in Maxwell\u2019s equations by sayingthat the equations applied to some \u201cabsolute space,\u201d a fundamentalreference frame for the entire Universe. This absolutespace was also sometimes called the \u201caether\u201d and was conceived ofClassical Cosmology 27Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nStrange and wonderful though all these things are, they are only\nperipheral to the story of modern cosmology and to the search forlinks between quantum physics and gravity. All the strange notions implicit in the theory\u2014the con-stancy of the speed of light, the stretching of time and shrinking oflength for moving objects, the increase in mass of a moving object\u2014have been measured and confirmed to great precision in very manyClassical Cosmology 29Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Yet the great universal constant, c, is a speed, and speed\nis a measure that relates space and time. So the fact that the fundamentalconstant is a velocity must be telling us something significant aboutthe Universe.  (Instead of\nthinking about space and time as two separate entities, as long agoas 1905 Einstein was telling physicists that they should be thinkingabout them as different aspects of a single, unified whole\u2014space-time. But this space-time, the special theory also said, was not fixedand permanent like the absolute space or absolute time ofNewtonian physics\u2014it could be stretched or squeezed. Bent space-time was real: the general theoryof relativity was correct. \nBut the equations developed by Einstein to describe the distortion\nof space-time by the presence of matter, the very equations thatwere so triumphantly vindicated by the eclipse observations, con-tained a baffling feature that even Einstein could not comprehend.The equations insisted that the space-time in which the materialUniverse is embedded could not be static.

Next came a collectionof essays called Black Holes and Baby Universes which contained a\nmixture of separate short pieces covering a range of subjects fromtechnical lectures to descriptions of the author\u2019s personal life andviews on religion and philosophy. \nBut by far the most significant commercial addition to Hawking\u2019s\nliterary canon was the publication, late in 2001, of The Universe in\na Nutshell . In this book, Hawking considered many of the themes\nhe had covered in A Brief History of Time but attempted to deal\nwith them in clearer terms aimed squarely at a lay audience. Many found The Universe in a Nutshell far more\napproachable than Hawking\u2019s earlier work, yet some found littlemerit in it.\u201d\n2\nThe fact that the early 1990s saw the start of a Hawking indus-\ntry (of which the original version of this book was a significant part)should come as no surprise.

The sum-over-histories approach was Feynman\u2019s contribution to this morepragmatic form of \u201cunderstanding\u201d at the quantum level, and in thelate 1970s Hawking applied it to the study of the Big Bang.)\nQuantum theory tells us that we can neither shrink away a blackhole to a mathematical point nor look back in time literally to themoment when time \u201cbegan.\u201d Even if we pushed the Big Bang modelto its most extreme limit, we would have to envisage the Universebeing created with an \u201cage\u201d equal to the Planck time.

In the same way,at the Big Bang there was no past, and all times lay in the future. You just cannot get backto a time before the Big Bang (strictly speaking, before the Plancktime) because there simply is no \u201cbefore.\nAlready, in 1981, the attention of Hawking and other theorists wasfocusing on the next question\u2014how did a tiny seed of a Universeget blown up to the enormous size that we see today.htmlThe puzzle of how the Universe has got to be as big as it is today\nhad itself loomed larger and larger during the 1970s. When every-body thought that the Big Bang theory was just a model to playwith, they didn\u2019t worry too much about the details of how it mightwork. \nThere were two problems that cosmologists were simply unable\nto answer in the 1970s.Cosmologists suspected that the smoothness and flatness of theUniverse were telling us something fundamental about the nature ofthe Big Bang, but nobody could see just what that might be until ayoung researcher at Cornell University, Alan Guth, came up with anew idea. At that pointthe inflation was exhausted, and the grapefruit-sized fireball beganthe steady expansion associated with the standard model of the BigBang, growing over the next 15 billion years to become the entirevisible Universe.

Hawking alwayswanted things done yesterday. And it wasin that year that Stephen Hawking began to turn his attentiontoward the exotic astronomical objects recently dubbed \u201cblackholes\u201d and once again found himself in collaboration with themathematician Roger Penrose. Soon after the birth of his second child,Lucy, in November 1970, he was thinking about black holes as hegot ready for bed one night. Suddenly,\nI realised that many of the techniques that Penrose and I had developed to provesingularities could be applied to black holes.\n2\nAt that time, notions of what a black hole was really like were\npretty hazy, and both Penrose and Hawking had been trying tocome up with some way of stating which points in space-time wereinside a black hole and which were outside. \nFor the next two years (as we describe more fully in Chapter 9)\nthe pair of them developed their ideas about the physics of blackholes. As they worked, they came to see that the way they hadoriginally perceived black hole physics was not as clear cut as itought to be. In particular,Hawking was gaining a renewed interest in a field called thermo-dynamics, developed by Lord Kelvin and others in the nineteenthcentury. \nNo one would have imagined that thermodynamics had any rel-\nevance to black holes at all. Little did Hawking realize at the time that thermodynamics\nwas to have a huge influence on the future of black hole theory andwould shortly lead him into his second major scientific confronta-tion with another physicist. \nBy early 1973, Hawking and Penrose were beginning to use\nthermodynamics as an analogy for what was happening in a blackhole.\nHe had been using thermodynamics as nothing more than a modelfor what was going on and believed it totally ridiculous to take itfurther and actually apply it to black holes.In reply to a paper Bekenstein published, Hawking, Carter, andBardeen responded with their own, entitled \u201cThe Four Laws ofBlack Hole Mechanics.htmlIn those days in 1973 when I was often told that I was headed the wrong way, I\ndrew some comfort from Wheeler\u2019s opinion that \u201cblack hole thermodynamics iscrazy, perhaps crazy enough to work. What brought about the change was aseries of events that would lead him to a far more important con-clusion about black holes and propel him to the forefront of theo-retical physics. \nMeanwhile Hawking was finding the mathematics of the work\nincreasingly difficult to deal with. The equations for interpreting thephysics of black holes are amazingly complex, and by this stage ofhis illness he could use neither paper and pen nor a typewriter.\n6STEPHEN HAWKING 124Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nBetween trips abroad and working on black holes with Roger\nPenrose, Hawking was collaborating with George Ellis on a bookeventually to be called The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime . George Ellis was one of Hawking\u2019s close associatesSTEPHEN HAWKING 126Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. In particular,Hawking\u2019s own work on black holes (with which Ellis was notdirectly involved) had progressed faster than they could amend thetext. The book dealt purely with classical theories of cosmology, butby the time of its publication in 1973, Hawking had made greatstrides in the quantum interpretation of black hole physics, and itwas not until it went into a second edition that they were able toupdate the text.\u201d asked Hawking. The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime and other, later, tech-\nnical books of Hawking\u2019s showed a definite upturn in their salescurves upon the publication, many years later, of A Brief History of\nTime . \nIn the world of black hole research, work was moving forward at a\nstartling pace, and Hawking was in the vanguard. It was becomingmore and more clear to him that the purely classical interpretationof black holes was deficient. He andhis team had been working on black holes, in particular on the wayin which they interacted with light.\u201d\n7STEPHEN HAWKING 128Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Itseemed to be the only way forward if he were to explain thebehavior of black holes thrown up by the contradictory ideas ofBekenstein on the one hand and of him and Penrose on the other. According to the equations, black holes appeared to beemitting radiation. \nGoing against all current ideas about black holes, by the power of\nmathematical reasoning, Hawking had been forced to the unarguableconclusion that not only did tiny black holes emit radiation, butunder certain conditions they could actually explode. STEPHEN HAWKING 130Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.\u201d The radiation that he had discovered could beemitted by certain black holes was from then on known as HawkingRadiation. \nHowever, not everyone was convinced, and it was quite a while\nbefore many groups working around the world came to terms withthis revolution in black hole physics.\u201d\n8\nThe mid-seventies saw the beginnings of a renaissance in publicawareness of science, and the idea of such exotic objects as blackholes that could eat whole solar systems for breakfast caught thepublic imagination.\nHe was becoming the black hole cosmonaut trapped in a crippledbody, piercing the mysteries of the Universe with the mind of alatter-day Einstein, going where even angels feared to tread. WithSTEPHEN HAWKING 132Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthe arrival of black holes in the public consciousness, the mystique\nthat had begun to gather around him in Cambridge at the end of thesixties started to extend beyond the cloistered limits of the physicscommunity. Newspaper articles and TV documentaries about blackholes started to appear, and Stephen Hawking began to be seen asthe man to talk to. Hawking\u2019s achievements had been noticed by the sci-entific establishment. STEPHEN HAWKING 134Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.9\nWhen Black Holes Explode\n135In 1970, as we have mentioned in Chapter 7, Hawking had\nshifted the focus of his scientific attention from what goes on atthe heart of a black hole, at the singularity, to events that occur\non the horizon surrounding the black hole, the nearest thing it hasto a \u201csurface. But when you apply your theory to predict what goes on atthe surface of a black hole, at the horizon, then whatever strangeevents it describes ought to make their mark on the outside Universeand might even produce effects that could be detected by instru-ments here on Earth or on satellites in orbit around the Earth. \nIt was, in fact, satellite borne instruments that identified, at about\nthis time, the first really plausible black hole candidate in our MilkyWay Galaxy. An isolated black hole is, of course, unde-\ntectable, except by its gravitational pull\u2014the way it distorts spacein its vicinity. Matter torn off the companion star by thegravitational influence of the black hole would funnel down intothe hole and be swallowed up. Theorbital variations also give astronomers a clue to the masses ofSTEPHEN HAWKING 136Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthe two stars, and that turned out to be crucial in identifying\nblack hole candidates.But four reasonable black hole prospects did emerge from the firstX-ray surveys of the sky, carried out in the early 1970s. Another had a mass three times that of theSun, which seemed a little high for a neutron star but left room fordoubt about its black hole status. Ultimate proof that Cygnus X-1 harbors a black hole wouldonly come if we were able to go and look at it close up; but theweight of evidence that has accumulated over two decades has con-When Black Holes Explode 137Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Several other promising candidates are also now known,which strengthens the case\u2014we would hardly expect there to bejust one detectable black hole in our Galaxy. \nThe identification of Cygnus X-1 itself as a black hole candidate\nwas the occasion of a famous bet, which sheds intriguing light onHawking\u2019s character. Hawking, whose career has been founded onthe study of black holes, made a bet with Kip Thorne of Caltech,that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. The form of the betwas that, if it were ever proved that the source is a black hole,Hawking would give Thorne a year\u2019s subscription to Penthouse ; but\nif it were ever proved that Cygnus X-1 is not a black hole, Thornewould give Hawking a four-year subscription to the satirical maga-zine Private Eye. But why didHawking bet against black holes.\nIf black holes didn\u2019t exist, he had been wasting his time for most ofhis career, but at least he would have had the consolation of win-ning the bet. \nIn the eyes of most astronomers, Hawking erred on the side of\nextreme caution in waiting so long to pay up; he had lost his bet,STEPHEN HAWKING 138Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthey reckoned, several years ago, for there is no reasonable doubt\nthat Cygnus X-1 is indeed a black hole. And since black holes doexist, that makes Hawking\u2019s investigation of their properties duringthe early 1970s one of the most important pieces of scientificresearch ever carried out. \nJust as Hawking and Penrose had shown that the physics of the Big\nBang actually gets simpler , not harder, the closer you delve back\ntoward the beginning, so in the late 1960s other research hadshown that collapsing black holes are much simpler than the objectsthat collapse to form them. You could, in principle, make a blackhole out of anything: by squeezing the Earth to the size of a pea; oradding scrap iron to a heap until you had enough for gravity to takeover; or by watching a star much heavier than our Sun run throughits life cycle, explode, and die. But however you make a black hole,what you end up with is a singularity surrounded by a perfectlyspherical horizon, with a size (surface area) that depends only onthe mass of the hole, not on what it is made of. When he first developedthe equations, Israel himself thought that because black holes hadto be spherical, what the equations were telling him was that onlya perfectly spherical object could collapse to form a black hole. ButRoger Penrose and John Wheeler found that an object collapsing toform a black hole would radiate away energy in the form of gravi-tational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of space-time itself. Penrose and Wheeler showed that any collapsingWhen Black Holes Explode 139Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlobject would end up perfectly spherical by the time it formed a\nblack hole. \nSo it was established by the early 1970s that a black hole could\nrotate, but it could not pulsate (Hawking played a small part in thiswork, too). The size and shape of a black hole depend only on itsmass and the speed at which it rotates; the horizon, all that we cansee from the outside Universe, carries no identifying features thatcan tell us what the hole was made of. \nAs nothing can get out of a black hole, its mass can never\ndecrease. \nHe was so excited largely because he and Penrose had only just,\nat that time, come up with a practical mathematical definition of ablack hole horizon in terms of the tracks of light rays throughspace-time. With this definition, he realized, the surface area of theblack hole would always increase if matter or radiation fell into thehole, and even if two black holes collided with one another andmerged, the area of the new black hole would always be greaterSTEPHEN HAWKING 140Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthan (or, just possibly, the same as) the areas of the two original\nblack holes put together. After all, the X-ray obser-vations that led to the identification of Cygnus X-1 with a visiblestar were made the next year, in 1971, and it was not until the endof 1972 that the consensus that the X-rays come from a black holeorbiting that star was reached. What really began to make otherphysicists sit up and take notice of Hawking\u2019s ideas about theincreasing area of a black hole was the seemingly outrageous sug-gestion that this might be connected with the branch of physicsknown as thermodynamics. These changes are linked to the passage of time, marking aWhen Black Holes Explode 141Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nSo Hawking\u2019s dramatic realization, coming with such force that\nevening in November 1970, was to lead to the idea that the lawwhich says that the area of a black hole can only stay the same orincrease is equivalent to the law which says that the entropy of aclosed system can only stay the same or increase.

So if we look back far enough, we come to a time when thepressure was great enough to squeeze any amount of matter youfancy, even a few grams, into a black hole. \nThe one snag with this argument is that, if the Universe were per-\nfectly smooth and uniform back then, no miniholes could form; theonly black hole would be the entire Universe itself. But providedthere were some irregularities, some variations in density from placeto place in the early Universe, then at the appropriate stage of theBig Bang a few grams of matter, any region that just happened to bea little denser than the average, could indeed get pinched off fromthe rest of space-time, forming tiny black holes that would last for-ever (or so Hawking thought in 1971) and still be around today. So Hawking\u2019s notion of primordial black miniholesseemed plausible, even if there was no obvious way to test the idea. STEPHEN HAWKING 144Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlIn fact, although lightweight by the standards of conventional\nblack holes, even a minihole may have rather a lot of mass byeveryday standards. In 1969 Roger Penrose had\nshown that it is possible for a rotating black hole to lose energy and\nslow down as it does so. When Black Holes Explode 145Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. In 1973two Soviet researchers, Yakov Zel\u2019dovich and Alex Starobinsky,extended this idea to show that a rotating black hole should alsothrow off particles. He was surprised, and at first annoyed, to discover thatthe equations said that the same process should be at work even fora nonrotating black hole. \n\u201cI was afraid,\u201d Hawking wrote in A Brief History of Time, \u201cthat\nif Bekenstein found out about it, he would use it as a further argu-ment to support his ideas about the entropy of black holes, which Istill did not like. He had found that all black holes emit energetic parti-cles and that therefore every black hole has a temperature. Thetemperature exactly matches the thermodynamic predictions relatedto the surface area of the black hole. When Black Holes Explode 147Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nWhat Hawking showed was that, even for a nonrotating black\nhole, this process can drain off energy from a hole and release it intothe Universe at large.Hawking had contradicted his own earlier conclusion that the sur-face area of a black hole cannot decrease. Having established a linkbetween black holes and thermodynamics by showing that, accord-ing to general relativity alone, black holes cannot shrink, he hadnow found that if you add quantum theory to the brew the link withthermodynamics is strengthened, but now black holes must shrink. \nFor ordinary black holes, made out of dead stars, this effect\nwould be of no real importance. A black hole with three or fourtimes the mass of our Sun and a horizon roughly as big as the sur-face of a neutron star will be constantly swallowing traces of gasand dust from its surroundings, even in the depths of space, and itSTEPHEN HAWKING 148Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. If nobody had thoughtof the notion of miniholes, nobody would have been very interestedin Hawking Radiation. But since Hawking had already come upwith the notion of miniholes, the idea of quantum evaporation ofblack holes made an immediate impact. So the HawkingRadiation from the surface of a minihole will actually dominate itsbehavior. Hawking showed that the radiation produced in this waygives the hole a temperature, exactly the temperature suggested bythe work of Bekenstein. \nThe lifetime of such a minihole depends on the exact mass it\nstarts out with, but roughly proton-sized black holes born in the BigBang should be exploding here and there in the Universe today.When Black Holes Explode 149Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Itis just possible that the Hawking Radiation from exploding blackholes has actually been discovered, although it will be almostimpossible ever to prove this. \nHawking had achieved something that even he had thought to be\nalmost impossible, using a combination of general relativity andquantum physics (plus a smattering of thermodynamics) in onepackage to describe a physical phenomenon. But in a quirky gesture whichis in some ways typical of Hawking\u2019s attitude toward establishedconventions, the astonishing discovery that \u201cblack holes are notblack\u201d was announced first not in the pages of a scientific journalsuch as Nature but in an essay that Hawking entered for a some-\nwhat obscure competition organized by the Gravity ResearchFoundation in America.

Soon Hawking would beusing that insight to focus, once more, on the puzzle of thesingularity at the beginning of time. But it seems, with hindsight,singularly appropriate that his election as a fellow of the RoyalSociety, Britain\u2019s highest academic honor, should have come in thespring of 1974, within a few weeks of the publication of the Nature\nversion of the exploding black hole paper.

Observations showed that the Universe is, indeed,expanding. So what did Einstein\u2019s equations say about conditionslong ago, when galaxies were packed tightly together, and before.Taken at face value, the equations said that the Universe must haveemerged from a point of infinite density, a singularity, about 15 bil-lion years ago. \u201cObviously\u201d (to astronomers of the 1940s andFrom Black Holes to the Big Bang 79Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Or perhaps there had been a previous phase of theUniverse in which space-time was collapsing, in line with Einstein\u2019sequations. The notion of a super-dense cosmic egg, onlyabout thirty times bigger than our Sun but containing everything,which had burst asunder to create the expanding Universe, fittedEinstein\u2019s equations and the observations. Obviously, the Universe welive in cannot be expanding and contracting at the same time; thetwo solutions to the equations cannot both apply to the Universetoday. Both the expand-ing and the contracting solutions to Einstein\u2019s equations describemodel universes, intriguing mathematical toys; the expanding solu-tion might describe the real Universe. At the beginning of the 1960s,however, most cosmologists would have preferred to call even theexpanding solution simply a model universe. \nBut during the 1960s the whole notion of the Big Bang, as the\ntheory was known, firmed up. Thisencouraged more theoretical calculations, leading to new predic-tions, and more observations, in a self-stimulating upward spiralthat led to a dramatic revolution in our understanding of the birthof the Universe. By 1976 the Big Bang theory was so well estab-lished that American physicist Steven Weinberg was able to write abest-selling popular book, The First Three Minutes, describing the\nearly stages of the Big Bang, how the Universe had emerged fromFrom Black Holes to the Big Bang 81Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthe super-dense state of the cosmic egg. Although written in the\n1970s, the book encapsulated what was essentially the 1960sunderstanding of the Big Bang; we will not be getting too far aheadof our story if we give a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of that understanding now. \nOne of the strangest things to grasp about all these descriptions of\nthe Universe\u2014the relativistic cosmological models\u2014is that the BigBang does not consist of a huge primeval atom sitting in emptyspace and then exploding outward. \nWhat Einstein\u2019s equations tell us is that it is space itself that\nexpands, taking galaxies along for the ride. Galaxies were closertogether long ago, when the Universe was younger, because the dis-tances between them were more compressed than they are today.

The \u201cexplosion\u201d of the Big Bang stretchedspace, literally creating more room in which the material compo-nents of the cosmic egg could move. \nAlthough the physics of the 1960s could not say what went on\nduring the split second following that beginning of time, it coulddescribe in great detail everything that had happened to the Universein the 15 billion years beginning just one-tenth of a second later. The temperature was 30 billion degrees,* and theFrom Black Holes to the Big Bang 83\n*Physicists measure temperature in degrees kelvin, denoted by the letter K.1 seconds after the beginning, the Universe\nhad cooled dramatically\u2014all the way down to ten billion K. \nJust 3 minutes and 2 seconds after the beginning, the temperature\nhad cooled to below one billion K\u2014the entire Universe was thenonly seventy times as hot as the heart of the Sun is today. But it took a further700,000 years for the Universe to cool enough to allow electrons tobecome attached to the nuclei and form stable atoms. After 700,000 years, however, the temper-ature of the Universe had fallen to about 4,000 K (roughly the tem-perature at the surface of the Sun today), and nuclei and electronswere at last able to hold together to form stable atoms. Theradiation left over from the Big Bang had nothing more to do withthe matter, once it was no longer hot enough to separate electronsfrom their atomic nuclei and simply cooled steadily as the Universeexpanded. But as we shall see, that background radiation, the echoof creation, had a key role to play in persuading cosmologists thatone of their \u201cmodel universes\u201d might actually be telling them some-thing deeply significant about the real Universe.

In each case, once the objecthad been squeezed down to the critical size, gravity would takeover, closing space-time around the object while it continued toshrink away into the infinite density singularity inside the blackhole.

And even if black holes did exist, by their very nature theywould keep the singularities at their hearts locked away from sight orinvestigation. \nOne thing, however, should have worried those astronomers,\neven in the early 1960s. Just as you need to squeeze a small masshard to make a black hole, a larger mass needs less of a squeeze todo the same trick.5 billion solar masseswould form a black hole if it were all contained within a sphere onlytwice the diameter of our Solar System. If just 5 percent of the total mass were involved,such a supermassive black hole could indeed form. You could actually make a\nblack hole out of water, if you had enough of it.

The quasar\nstory actually began on the last day of 1960. Having sought in vain to find any alternative means toexplain the power of quasars, astronomers were reluctantly forcedto consider the possibility that they might be black holes. We nowknow that each quasar is a black hole containing at least a hundredmillion times as much mass as our Sun, contained within a volumeof space with about the same diameter as our Solar System.

It was Penrose who showed thatevery black hole must contain a singularity and that there is no wayfor material particles to slide past each other in the middle of thehole. Not just matter, but space-time itself simply disappears at theSTEPHEN HAWKING 114Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlsible to avoid the singularity inside a black hole. By the time the Hawking-Penrose theorems were published, John Wheeler had givenastronomers the term \u201cblack hole,\u201d and newspaper stories werebeing written about the phenomenon. STEPHEN HAWKING 116Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.", "Black_Hole_1970": "9\nWhen Black Holes Explode\n135In 1970, as we have mentioned in Chapter 7, Hawking had\nshifted the focus of his scientific attention from what goes on atthe heart of a black hole, at the singularity, to events that occur\non the horizon surrounding the black hole, the nearest thing it hasto a \u201csurface. But when you apply your theory to predict what goes on atthe surface of a black hole, at the horizon, then whatever strangeevents it describes ought to make their mark on the outside Universeand might even produce effects that could be detected by instru-ments here on Earth or on satellites in orbit around the Earth. \nIt was, in fact, satellite borne instruments that identified, at about\nthis time, the first really plausible black hole candidate in our MilkyWay Galaxy. An isolated black hole is, of course, unde-\ntectable, except by its gravitational pull\u2014the way it distorts spacein its vicinity. Matter torn off the companion star by thegravitational influence of the black hole would funnel down intothe hole and be swallowed up. Theorbital variations also give astronomers a clue to the masses ofSTEPHEN HAWKING 136Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthe two stars, and that turned out to be crucial in identifying\nblack hole candidates.But four reasonable black hole prospects did emerge from the firstX-ray surveys of the sky, carried out in the early 1970s. Another had a mass three times that of theSun, which seemed a little high for a neutron star but left room fordoubt about its black hole status. Ultimate proof that Cygnus X-1 harbors a black hole wouldonly come if we were able to go and look at it close up; but theweight of evidence that has accumulated over two decades has con-When Black Holes Explode 137Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Several other promising candidates are also now known,which strengthens the case\u2014we would hardly expect there to bejust one detectable black hole in our Galaxy. \nThe identification of Cygnus X-1 itself as a black hole candidate\nwas the occasion of a famous bet, which sheds intriguing light onHawking\u2019s character. Hawking, whose career has been founded onthe study of black holes, made a bet with Kip Thorne of Caltech,that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. The form of the betwas that, if it were ever proved that the source is a black hole,Hawking would give Thorne a year\u2019s subscription to Penthouse ; but\nif it were ever proved that Cygnus X-1 is not a black hole, Thornewould give Hawking a four-year subscription to the satirical maga-zine Private Eye. But why didHawking bet against black holes.\nIf black holes didn\u2019t exist, he had been wasting his time for most ofhis career, but at least he would have had the consolation of win-ning the bet.htmlthey reckoned, several years ago, for there is no reasonable doubt\nthat Cygnus X-1 is indeed a black hole. And since black holes doexist, that makes Hawking\u2019s investigation of their properties duringthe early 1970s one of the most important pieces of scientificresearch ever carried out. \nJust as Hawking and Penrose had shown that the physics of the Big\nBang actually gets simpler , not harder, the closer you delve back\ntoward the beginning, so in the late 1960s other research hadshown that collapsing black holes are much simpler than the objectsthat collapse to form them. But however you make a black hole,what you end up with is a singularity surrounded by a perfectlyspherical horizon, with a size (surface area) that depends only onthe mass of the hole, not on what it is made of. When he first developedthe equations, Israel himself thought that because black holes hadto be spherical, what the equations were telling him was that onlya perfectly spherical object could collapse to form a black hole. ButRoger Penrose and John Wheeler found that an object collapsing toform a black hole would radiate away energy in the form of gravi-tational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of space-time itself. Penrose and Wheeler showed that any collapsingWhen Black Holes Explode 139Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlobject would end up perfectly spherical by the time it formed a\nblack hole. \nSo it was established by the early 1970s that a black hole could\nrotate, but it could not pulsate (Hawking played a small part in thiswork, too). The size and shape of a black hole depend only on itsmass and the speed at which it rotates; the horizon, all that we cansee from the outside Universe, carries no identifying features thatcan tell us what the hole was made of. \nAs nothing can get out of a black hole, its mass can never\ndecrease. \nHe was so excited largely because he and Penrose had only just,\nat that time, come up with a practical mathematical definition of ablack hole horizon in terms of the tracks of light rays throughspace-time. With this definition, he realized, the surface area of theblack hole would always increase if matter or radiation fell into thehole, and even if two black holes collided with one another andmerged, the area of the new black hole would always be greaterSTEPHEN HAWKING 140Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthan (or, just possibly, the same as) the areas of the two original\nblack holes put together. After all, the X-ray obser-vations that led to the identification of Cygnus X-1 with a visiblestar were made the next year, in 1971, and it was not until the endof 1972 that the consensus that the X-rays come from a black holeorbiting that star was reached. What really began to make otherphysicists sit up and take notice of Hawking\u2019s ideas about theincreasing area of a black hole was the seemingly outrageous sug-gestion that this might be connected with the branch of physicsknown as thermodynamics. These changes are linked to the passage of time, marking aWhen Black Holes Explode 141Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nSo Hawking\u2019s dramatic realization, coming with such force that\nevening in November 1970, was to lead to the idea that the lawwhich says that the area of a black hole can only stay the same orincrease is equivalent to the law which says that the entropy of aclosed system can only stay the same or increase. The thought oftrying to make a connection between the gravitational physics ofblack holes and the thermodynamic physics of Victorian steamengines would have daunted even the genius of a Hawking. But whena student at Princeton University, Jacob Bekenstein, suggested thatthe size of the horizon around the singularity might literally be ameasure of the entropy of a black hole, he started an avalanche ofSTEPHEN HAWKING 142Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlinvestigation which led Hawking to the discovery that black holes\nare not necessarily black after all\u2014they explode. And if a black hole had a temperature,then heat would flow out of it, into the cold (\u2013270\u00b0C) of theUniverse.

In 1969 Roger Penrose had\nshown that it is possible for a rotating black hole to lose energy and\nslow down as it does so. When Black Holes Explode 145Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. In 1973two Soviet researchers, Yakov Zel\u2019dovich and Alex Starobinsky,extended this idea to show that a rotating black hole should alsothrow off particles. He was surprised, and at first annoyed, to discover thatthe equations said that the same process should be at work even fora nonrotating black hole. \n\u201cI was afraid,\u201d Hawking wrote in A Brief History of Time, \u201cthat\nif Bekenstein found out about it, he would use it as a further argu-ment to support his ideas about the entropy of black holes, which Istill did not like. He had found that all black holes emit energetic parti-cles and that therefore every black hole has a temperature. Thetemperature exactly matches the thermodynamic predictions relatedto the surface area of the black hole. When Black Holes Explode 147Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nWhat Hawking showed was that, even for a nonrotating black\nhole, this process can drain off energy from a hole and release it intothe Universe at large.Hawking had contradicted his own earlier conclusion that the sur-face area of a black hole cannot decrease. Having established a linkbetween black holes and thermodynamics by showing that, accord-ing to general relativity alone, black holes cannot shrink, he hadnow found that if you add quantum theory to the brew the link withthermodynamics is strengthened, but now black holes must shrink. A black hole with three or fourtimes the mass of our Sun and a horizon roughly as big as the sur-face of a neutron star will be constantly swallowing traces of gasand dust from its surroundings, even in the depths of space, and itSTEPHEN HAWKING 148Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. If nobody had thoughtof the notion of miniholes, nobody would have been very interestedin Hawking Radiation. But since Hawking had already come upwith the notion of miniholes, the idea of quantum evaporation ofblack holes made an immediate impact. \nThe lifetime of such a minihole depends on the exact mass it\nstarts out with, but roughly proton-sized black holes born in the BigBang should be exploding here and there in the Universe today.When Black Holes Explode 149Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Itis just possible that the Hawking Radiation from exploding blackholes has actually been discovered, although it will be almostimpossible ever to prove this. \nHawking had achieved something that even he had thought to be\nalmost impossible, using a combination of general relativity andquantum physics (plus a smattering of thermodynamics) in onepackage to describe a physical phenomenon. But in a quirky gesture whichis in some ways typical of Hawking\u2019s attitude toward establishedconventions, the astonishing discovery that \u201cblack holes are notblack\u201d was announced first not in the pages of a scientific journalsuch as Nature but in an essay that Hawking entered for a some-\nwhat obscure competition organized by the Gravity ResearchFoundation in America. Sowhen Stephen Hawking won the same prize a year or two later foran essay describing black holes, J.\u201d STEPHEN HAWKING 150Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlThe \u201cofficial\u201d version of the exploding black hole story appeared\nfirst in Nature on March 1, 1974.4While the Gravity Research\nFoundation essay carried the dogmatic title \u201cBlack Holes Aren\u2019tBlack,\u201d the Nature paper, uncharacteristically for Hawking, was\nequivocally headed \u201cBlack Hole Explosions. JohnTaylor and Paul Davies, of King\u2019s College in London, combined toproduce a retort in the issue of Nature dated July 5, 1974,\n5headed\n\u201cDo Black Holes Really Explode. When Black Holes Explode 151Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Although Hawking himself has expressed reservations\nabout the idea, which goes by the name of continual inflation, it isin fact based on his dramatic breakthrough discovery from 1974that black holes explode. \nHawking Radiation, as we saw in Chapter 9, is produced by the\ninterplay of quantum effects and gravity at the horizon surroundinga black hole. But Hawking and his colleague Gary Gibbons, whoshared an office with him in Cambridge in the late 1970s, realizedthat this kind of radiation must be produced wherever there is ahorizon of this kind and that such horizons do not always surroundblack holes. For according to Alan Guth and his colleague Edward Fahri,all you need is enough energy to squeeze some matter into forminga black hole. Then the new universe comes free\u2014one universe freewith every black hole. In a tour de force to rank with the great con-\njuring tricks, Guth and Fahri have shown that the two great threadsof Hawking\u2019s life\u2019s work are really one and the same: black holes arebig bangs. \nRemember that the seed of such a bubble universe must be self-\ncontained, destined ultimately to collapse back in on itself; in otherwords, it must be a black hole. The blackWhen the Universe Has Babies 213Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlhole would simply form, spend billions of years evaporating\nthrough Hawking Radiation, and then disappear. STEPHEN HAWKING 214Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. But where Hawking has made his reputation by investi-gating in great detail one particular set of problems\u2014the singulari-ties and horizons around black holes and at the beginning of time\u2014Rees is known and respected for the breadth of his work, rangingfrom quasars and pulsars to the influence of black holes on theirsurroundings, cosmology, and the nature of the dark matter thatholds the Universe closed.", "Black_Hole_1980": "11\nBack to the Beginning\n175By the end of 1974, Hawking\u2019s work on black holes had\nshown that, using the general theory of relativity alone,the equations said that the surface area of a black hole\ncould not shrink\u2014but adding in the quantum rules to the equationsrevealed that they could not only shrink but would eventually dis-appear in a puff of gamma radiation. His earlier work with Penrosehad shown that, using the general theory of relativity alone, theequations said that the Universe must have been born out of a sin-gularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume, at a time some15 billion years ago.htmlrestricting himself to the specific puzzle of how relativity and quan-\ntum mechanics interacted at the beginning of time, Hawking wasable to make progress, to such an extent that by the early 1980s hewas posing the question of whether there ever had been a beginningto time at all. \nWhen a black hole evaporates, what happens to the singularity\ninside it. One simple guess might be that in the final stages of theevaporation the horizon around the hole vanishes, leaving behindthe naked singularity that nature is supposed to abhor. In fact,though, the equations developed by Hawking in the early 1970s toSTEPHEN HAWKING 178Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmldescribe exploding black holes could not be pushed to such\nextremes. The best guessthat Hawking, or anyone else, could make in 1974 was that whena black hole has evaporated to this point it would completely dis-appear, taking the singularity with it. So if an evaporating black hole were to shrink to thepoint where it was just one Planck length in diameter, it could notshrink any more.)\nQuantum theory tells us that we can neither shrink away a blackhole to a mathematical point nor look back in time literally to themoment when time \u201cbegan. Having started out in 1975 from thepuzzle of what happens in the last stages of the evaporation of ablack hole, by 1981 Hawking was ready to unveil his new ideas,incorporating Feynman\u2019s sum-over-histories version of quantummechanics, to explain how the Universe had come into being. \nNow, says Hawking, we have to imagine the Big Bang as corre-\nsponding to a point on the surface of the sphere, at the North Pole. Thewhole package of space and time, matter and energy, is completelyself-contained.\nAlready, in 1981, the attention of Hawking and other theorists wasfocusing on the next question\u2014how did a tiny seed of a Universeget blown up to the enormous size that we see today.

Several other promising candidates are also now known,which strengthens the case\u2014we would hardly expect there to bejust one detectable black hole in our Galaxy. But why didHawking bet against black holes.\nIf black holes didn\u2019t exist, he had been wasting his time for most ofhis career, but at least he would have had the consolation of win-ning the bet.htmlthey reckoned, several years ago, for there is no reasonable doubt\nthat Cygnus X-1 is indeed a black hole. And since black holes doexist, that makes Hawking\u2019s investigation of their properties duringthe early 1970s one of the most important pieces of scientificresearch ever carried out. \nJust as Hawking and Penrose had shown that the physics of the Big\nBang actually gets simpler , not harder, the closer you delve back\ntoward the beginning, so in the late 1960s other research hadshown that collapsing black holes are much simpler than the objectsthat collapse to form them. You could, in principle, make a blackhole out of anything: by squeezing the Earth to the size of a pea; oradding scrap iron to a heap until you had enough for gravity to takeover; or by watching a star much heavier than our Sun run throughits life cycle, explode, and die. But however you make a black hole,what you end up with is a singularity surrounded by a perfectlyspherical horizon, with a size (surface area) that depends only onthe mass of the hole, not on what it is made of. When he first developedthe equations, Israel himself thought that because black holes hadto be spherical, what the equations were telling him was that onlya perfectly spherical object could collapse to form a black hole. ButRoger Penrose and John Wheeler found that an object collapsing toform a black hole would radiate away energy in the form of gravi-tational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of space-time itself. Penrose and Wheeler showed that any collapsingWhen Black Holes Explode 139Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlobject would end up perfectly spherical by the time it formed a\nblack hole. \nSo it was established by the early 1970s that a black hole could\nrotate, but it could not pulsate (Hawking played a small part in thiswork, too). \nAs nothing can get out of a black hole, its mass can never\ndecrease. With this definition, he realized, the surface area of theblack hole would always increase if matter or radiation fell into thehole, and even if two black holes collided with one another andmerged, the area of the new black hole would always be greaterSTEPHEN HAWKING 140Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlthan (or, just possibly, the same as) the areas of the two original\nblack holes put together. After all, the X-ray obser-vations that led to the identification of Cygnus X-1 with a visiblestar were made the next year, in 1971, and it was not until the endof 1972 that the consensus that the X-rays come from a black holeorbiting that star was reached. What really began to make otherphysicists sit up and take notice of Hawking\u2019s ideas about theincreasing area of a black hole was the seemingly outrageous sug-gestion that this might be connected with the branch of physicsknown as thermodynamics. These changes are linked to the passage of time, marking aWhen Black Holes Explode 141Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nSo Hawking\u2019s dramatic realization, coming with such force that\nevening in November 1970, was to lead to the idea that the lawwhich says that the area of a black hole can only stay the same orincrease is equivalent to the law which says that the entropy of aclosed system can only stay the same or increase. The thought oftrying to make a connection between the gravitational physics ofblack holes and the thermodynamic physics of Victorian steamengines would have daunted even the genius of a Hawking. But whena student at Princeton University, Jacob Bekenstein, suggested thatthe size of the horizon around the singularity might literally be ameasure of the entropy of a black hole, he started an avalanche ofSTEPHEN HAWKING 142Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlinvestigation which led Hawking to the discovery that black holes\nare not necessarily black after all\u2014they explode. And if a black hole had a temperature,then heat would flow out of it, into the cold (\u2013270\u00b0C) of theUniverse. It would radiate energy, contradicting the most basic factknown about black holes, that nothing at all\u2014not even electro-magnetic radiation\u2014can escape from them. It gave the formula forworking out the temperature of a black hole according to thisridiculous notion and was published in 1973. But far from agreeingwith Bekenstein, the team commented, \u201cIn fact the effective tem-perature of a black hole is absolute zero. The rea-\nsons why he had second thoughts were related to another line ofresearch on black holes he had been pursuing: the possibility, firstWhen Black Holes Explode 143Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.htmlaired in 1971, that very small \u201cminiholes,\u201d smaller even than the\nnucleus of an atom, might have been produced in the Big Bang andcould still be at large in the Universe today. \nThe critical mass needed to make a black hole simply by an object\ncollapsing under its own weight is, as we have mentioned, aboutthree times the mass of the Sun, and the Earth itself would becomea black hole if it were squeezed down to about a centimeter. Butabsolutely anything will make a black hole if it is squeezed hardenough\u2014a bag of sugar, a coin, the book you are reading, anything . So if we look back far enough, we come to a time when thepressure was great enough to squeeze any amount of matter youfancy, even a few grams, into a black hole. But providedthere were some irregularities, some variations in density from placeto place in the early Universe, then at the appropriate stage of theBig Bang a few grams of matter, any region that just happened to bea little denser than the average, could indeed get pinched off fromthe rest of space-time, forming tiny black holes that would last for-ever (or so Hawking thought in 1971) and still be around today.htmlIn fact, although lightweight by the standards of conventional\nblack holes, even a minihole may have rather a lot of mass byeveryday standards. In 1969 Roger Penrose had\nshown that it is possible for a rotating black hole to lose energy and\nslow down as it does so. When Black Holes Explode 145Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. In 1973two Soviet researchers, Yakov Zel\u2019dovich and Alex Starobinsky,extended this idea to show that a rotating black hole should alsothrow off particles. He was surprised, and at first annoyed, to discover thatthe equations said that the same process should be at work even fora nonrotating black hole. \n\u201cI was afraid,\u201d Hawking wrote in A Brief History of Time, \u201cthat\nif Bekenstein found out about it, he would use it as a further argu-ment to support his ideas about the entropy of black holes, which Istill did not like. He had found that all black holes emit energetic parti-cles and that therefore every black hole has a temperature. When Black Holes Explode 147Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. \nWhat Hawking showed was that, even for a nonrotating black\nhole, this process can drain off energy from a hole and release it intothe Universe at large. Having established a linkbetween black holes and thermodynamics by showing that, accord-ing to general relativity alone, black holes cannot shrink, he hadnow found that if you add quantum theory to the brew the link withthermodynamics is strengthened, but now black holes must shrink. A black hole with three or fourtimes the mass of our Sun and a horizon roughly as big as the sur-face of a neutron star will be constantly swallowing traces of gasand dust from its surroundings, even in the depths of space, and itSTEPHEN HAWKING 148Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. But since Hawking had already come upwith the notion of miniholes, the idea of quantum evaporation ofblack holes made an immediate impact. Hawking showed that the radiation produced in this waygives the hole a temperature, exactly the temperature suggested bythe work of Bekenstein. \nThe lifetime of such a minihole depends on the exact mass it\nstarts out with, but roughly proton-sized black holes born in the BigBang should be exploding here and there in the Universe today.When Black Holes Explode 149Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. Itis just possible that the Hawking Radiation from exploding blackholes has actually been discovered, although it will be almostimpossible ever to prove this. \nHawking had achieved something that even he had thought to be\nalmost impossible, using a combination of general relativity andquantum physics (plus a smattering of thermodynamics) in onepackage to describe a physical phenomenon. But in a quirky gesture whichis in some ways typical of Hawking\u2019s attitude toward establishedconventions, the astonishing discovery that \u201cblack holes are notblack\u201d was announced first not in the pages of a scientific journalsuch as Nature but in an essay that Hawking entered for a some-\nwhat obscure competition organized by the Gravity ResearchFoundation in America.

Hawking, whose career has been founded onthe study of black holes, made a bet with Kip Thorne of Caltech,that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. The form of the betwas that, if it were ever proved that the source is a black hole,Hawking would give Thorne a year\u2019s subscription to Penthouse ; but\nif it were ever proved that Cygnus X-1 is not a black hole, Thornewould give Hawking a four-year subscription to the satirical maga-zine Private Eye. In June 1990 Hawking decided that the evidence\nwas now overwhelming, and paid up\u2014although, being Hawking,he did so in a typically mischievous fashion, enlisting the aid of acolleague to break into Thorne\u2019s office at Caltech. But why didHawking bet against black holes. \nIn the eyes of most astronomers, Hawking erred on the side of\nextreme caution in waiting so long to pay up; he had lost his bet,STEPHEN HAWKING 138Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www. And since black holes doexist, that makes Hawking\u2019s investigation of their properties duringthe early 1970s one of the most important pieces of scientificresearch ever carried out. ButRoger Penrose and John Wheeler found that an object collapsing toform a black hole would radiate away energy in the form of gravi-tational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of space-time itself. Penrose and Wheeler showed that any collapsingWhen Black Holes Explode 139Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www. \nSo it was established by the early 1970s that a black hole could\nrotate, but it could not pulsate (Hawking played a small part in thiswork, too). ButStephen Hawking tells how the moment this hit him was so dra-matic that it has stuck in his memory for more than twenty years. With this definition, he realized, the surface area of theblack hole would always increase if matter or radiation fell into thehole, and even if two black holes collided with one another andmerged, the area of the new black hole would always be greaterSTEPHEN HAWKING 140Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www. \nThis discovery may have made Hawking so excited that he could\nnot sleep, and it may have impressed Roger Penrose when Hawkingtelephoned him the next day to discuss the idea, but initially it madevery little impression on other astronomers and physicists, whoregarded such notions as rather esoteric. After all, the X-ray obser-vations that led to the identification of Cygnus X-1 with a visiblestar were made the next year, in 1971, and it was not until the endof 1972 that the consensus that the X-rays come from a black holeorbiting that star was reached. What really began to make otherphysicists sit up and take notice of Hawking\u2019s ideas about theincreasing area of a black hole was the seemingly outrageous sug-gestion that this might be connected with the branch of physicsknown as thermodynamics. These changes are linked to the passage of time, marking aWhen Black Holes Explode 141Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www. \nSo Hawking\u2019s dramatic realization, coming with such force that\nevening in November 1970, was to lead to the idea that the lawwhich says that the area of a black hole can only stay the same orincrease is equivalent to the law which says that the entropy of aclosed system can only stay the same or increase. But even Hawkingdidn\u2019t make that connection at first. The thought oftrying to make a connection between the gravitational physics ofblack holes and the thermodynamic physics of Victorian steamengines would have daunted even the genius of a Hawking. But whena student at Princeton University, Jacob Bekenstein, suggested thatthe size of the horizon around the singularity might literally be ameasure of the entropy of a black hole, he started an avalanche ofSTEPHEN HAWKING 142Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www.htmlinvestigation which led Hawking to the discovery that black holes\nare not necessarily black after all\u2014they explode. \nHawking was annoyed by Bekenstein\u2019s suggestion.

The central idea of string theory is that entities that we are usedto thinking of as points (such as electrons and quarks) are actuallylinear\u2014tiny \u201cstrings.\u201d Such strings would be very small indeed: itwould take 10\n20of them, laid end to end, to stretch across the\ndiameter of a proton. \nString theory actually dates back to the late 1960s, when it was\ninvoked to describe the strong force. The success of QCD left thisearly version of string theory by the wayside, although a few math-ematicians dabbled with it out of interest in the equations, ratherthan in any expectation of making a major breakthrough in unify-ing our understanding of the forces of nature. In the mid-1970s twoof those researchers, Jo\u00ebl Scherk in Paris and John Schwarz atCaltech, actually found a way to describe gravity using string the-ory. String theory wasn\u2019t needed to explain thestrong force, supergravity looked promising, so why bother withstrings at all. \nThe main reason for the revival of interest in string theory in the\nmid-1980s, however, was the realization that in their most satisfac-tory form these theories automatically include the graviton. With string theory, they were workingwith the quantum equations in a general way, playing mathematicalgames, and found that the closed loops of string described by someof the equations have just the properties required to provide adescription of gravity\u2014they are, indeed, gravitons. Inevitably, thenew variation on the string theme was dubbed \u201csuperstring theory. One of the pioneers of superstring theory is Michael Green, ofQueen Mary College, in London.

Inan effort to lay the matter to rest Hawking wrote a letter to Physics\nToday , which was published in the February 1990 issue, in which\nhe said he was sure that the two teams had been working inde-pendently on new inflation and that he was sorry if his account ofthe incident had been misinterpreted by the readers of his book.

Articles started to appear by journalistscondemning what they saw as Hawking\u2019s own lack of qualificationin making his now-famous comments about religion and the inter-face between his scientific and religious ideas. In October 2001 apoll run by the science journal Physics World to find those whom\nphysicists themselves believed to be the greatest practitioners oftheir profession throughout history placed Einstein top with 119votes and Newton second with 46, but Hawking received only 1vote and came last (along with many other scientists).\n9\nMost prominent among Hawking\u2019s critics is Bryan Appleyard,\nwho has repeatedly attacked Hawking in the popular press, callinghim \u201carrogant\u201d and claiming that his remarks outside the world ofphysics are \u201cintellectually feeble.\u201d Appleyard\u2019s principal contentionis that Hawking knows nothing of philosophy but is trying to belit-tle the subject and to replace religious and philosophical convictionwith a purely empirical view of the universe. But in our opinionAppleyard is blinded by his own misguided conviction thatphilosophy is the noblest of subjects, declaring in one particularlyvitriolic piece: Stephen Hawking: Superstar 313Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www. Hawking\u2019s idea of science is that of a rarefied disciplinefar above the heads of ordinary people and definitely superior to all competingforms of knowledge.\n10\nIf this were so, why did Stephen Hawking write a popular science\nbook, why does he go out of his way to give free lectures to thepublic, and why is he so keen to have his books reach as wide amarket as possible. \nThe general feeling among many scientists who support\nHawking\u2019s stance is that Appleyard has an axe to grind and haspicked on Hawking as the embodiment of what he most despisesabout science. Hawking himself has said of the journalist, \u201cHe hasa real chip on his shoulder.\u201d\n11\nAppleyard is certainly not the only public critic of Hawking. One of Hawking\u2019smost able critics is the Nobel Prize nominee chemist Dr.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www.\u201d \nMost of the flak has come not only from Hawking\u2019s uncompro-\nmising empirical stance but also from his seeming disrespect for reli-gious or philosophical explanations of the origin and nature of theuniverse. For this part, Hawking considers the many public state-ments of his antagonists as a touch hysterical and has wryly com-mented that if he had not included the famous line of A Brief\nHistory of Time \u2014\u201cHowever, if we do discover a complete theory . \nAt the same time, whether his reputation is justified or not, there\nis no denying that Professor Stephen Hawking is now established asthe \u201cscientific genius\u201d of our age and as such he is approached forcomment upon almost anything that happens, even on the fringes ofscience, and perhaps unwisely, in his ongoing search for evengreater fame he is always quick to respond. \nFollowing the tragedy of September 11th, and as fears of biologi-\ncal attack swept across America, Hawking was reported as saying: \u201cIdon\u2019t think the human race will survive the next 1,000 years unlesswe spread into space.\u201d\n12Stephen Hawking: Superstar 315Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.Stephen Hawking: A Life in ScienceSecond Edition\nhttp://www.htmlA list of the subjects upon which Hawking has offered comment\nin recent years includes aliens: \u201cI think that any alien visitationwould be obvious and probably unpleasant.
