Eager to increase their own territories and thus their power,Poland was partitioned among these countries in the late eighteenth cen-tury. At the same time, Russia preparedits own plan for restoring the Polish state under the rule of the Russiantsar, Alexander I. Any hope that the Polish people had of regaining con-trol over their country through Napoleon was squelched after his disas-trous defeat by Russia (1811\u20131812).\nConstant tension existed between the despotic administration in Rus-\nsia and the constitutional regime in Poland. Even though the Polish army fought valiantly, inthe end it could not compete with the superior resources of Russia and wasforced to surrender in September 1831. The constitution was annulled, the army was liq-uidated, Warsaw University was closed, property was con\ufb01scated, andsuspected dissidents were deported.

An unmarried German woman, Elsa Neumann(1872\u20131902), was writing a thesis in electrochemistry and would eventu-ally \ufb01nish it, but it seemed impossible for Curie to complete the arduousresearch necessary for the degree.\nBecquerel\u2019s new kind of ray intrigued Marie Curie, as she was searching\nfor a subject for her doctoral thesis. Marie was positive that the strongradiation that they observed came from a new chemical element. Marie \ufb01rst boiled the pitchblende solution, then graduallycooled it, and \ufb01nally tested the crystals that were formed for radioactivitywith the Curie electrometer. Marie wrote, \u201cIn July, 1898, we announced the existence of thisTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 51new substance to which I gave the name of polonium, in memory of my\nnative country. Because ofthe connection with her native country, Marie felt that the discovery ofpolonium would be her most signi\ufb01cant contribution.

This experience was especially meaningful to Marie, because theHugginses were also a collaborative scienti\ufb01c team. By the end of Sep-64 MARIE CURIEtember Marie pronounced herself cured, although the doctors found her\nanemic.\nOn the positive side, several honors and prizes came to Marie and\nPierre this year.Then in 1903 they presented the coveted Gegner prize for the third timeto Marie for scienti\ufb01c promise.\nIn the June 25, 1903, issue of an American popular journal, The Inde-\npendent, Marie Curie described her investigations on radioactive sub-\nstances. But\u201ca perusal of the following pages will show that Professor Curie is ratherthe helpmate of his wife in this magni\ufb01cent piece of scienti\ufb01c work.\u201d\n5\nMarie Curie demonstrated to the American public in this short articlethat she could succinctly present her ideas and discoveries in such a waythat the general educated public could understand them. In December 1903, the Curies and Henri Bec-querel were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. Pierre Curie wasnominated by four members of the Acad\u00e9mie to share the Nobel Prize forphysics with Henri Becquerel, completely leaving Marie out. Pierre answered Mittag-Lef\ufb02er\u2019s letter stating\u201cif it is true that one is seriously thinking about me [for the prize], I verymuch wish to be considered together with Madame Curie with respect toour research on radioactive bodies.\u201d\n7However, since Marie Curie had not\nbeen nominated for the 1903 prize it seemed as if she would be ineligible. Thus, they decided to give the Curies the prize in physics in 1903\u201cfor their joint researches on the radiation phenomenon discovered byProfessor Henri Becquerel.\nAs a woman Nobel Laureate, Marie Curie was an oddity in 1903 and\nwould still be so today. From Marie Curie\u2019s 1903 prize in physics through Christiane-Nusslein-Volhard\u2019s prize in physiology and medicine in 1995, there havebeen only eleven women Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, comparedto over 400 men from 1901 (when the \ufb01rst prize was given) through 2000.Marie Curie was more acceptable because she worked in collaborationwith her husband. T\u00f6rnebladh, the presi-\ndent of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, he noted that the suc-66 MARIE CURIEcess of the Curies illustrated an old proverb, \u201cunion is strength.\nThe fact that Marie shared the prize with two men is taken for granted\ntoday. But when the Curies were doing their research it was widely as-sumed that Marie was merely Pierre\u2019s assistant.\u201d Thus Pierre was prepared to see Marie as an equal partner. Marie ex-plained that \u201ctheir devotion and their common interest in science were tothem both a stimulant and a support.\n14This publication\npolicy effectively enhanced the Curies\u2019 reputation as a collaborative cou-ple as well as helping to solidify Marie Curie\u2019s reputation as an indepen-dent scientist.\nCUTTING THE UNCUTTABLE\nEven though Marie Curie had postulated that radioactivity was atomic\nin nature, she still did not know what caused a substance to be radioac-tive. They either assumed that the68 MARIE CURIEuniverse was completely full\u2014made up of a continuum with no empty\nspaces\u2014or that it was composed of tiny indivisible particles moving inspace (a void). Marie Curie proposed two possible explanations\u2014ei-ther the radioactive substances were borrowing energy from an externalsource and then releasing it, or that the radium was the source of the en-ergy itself. We have al-ready seen that collaboration with a colleague can be a potent way to70 MARIE CURIEsolve a scienti\ufb01c problem.\nAlthough her life was very busy with home, children, husband, teach-\ning, and research (not to mention dealing with the press and those whowere fascinated by her prize), Marie still found more time than previouslyto socialize with friends.\n1572 MARIE CURIELater he again wrote to Gouy complaining \u201cI have not yet discovered\nwhat is the use of the Academy.

A positively charged electrode iscalled the anode and the negatively charged electrode (the source of whatwe now call electrons) is known as the cathode. While head of the physicsdepartment at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, R\u00f6ntgen investigated theproperties of cathode rays, or negatively charged particles (electrons)emitted by a high-vacuum discharge tube, which had been perfected inthe 1850s. When activated by a high-voltage current, the electrons wouldrace from the cathode to the positive electrode known as the anode. When the rays touched the glass wall of the tube, they cre-\nated a green or blue luminescence. R\u00f6ntgen became interested in the lu-minescence (glow) that the cathode rays produced. R\u00f6ntgen tried toreproduce the work of a German researcher, Phillip Lenard (1862\u20131947),who had observed the behavior of cathode rays when they escaped fromthe vacuum tube. Hismethod of studying the phenomenon was to wrap the cathode ray tube inblack cardboard to exclude all light, darken the room so that he could seea faint light, activate the tube with a high voltage current, and observethe gleam. R\u00f6ntgen postulated thatthe resultant radiation could not have been caused by the cathode rays be-cause these rays could not penetrate the cardboard. He established that these rays passed unchanged through cardboardand thin plates of metal and were not de\ufb02ected by electric or magnetic\ufb01elds, as were cathode rays. These rays actually came from theglass walls of the tube when struck by cathode rays. Although it is prob-able that X rays had been produced by others before R\u00f6ntgen, he \ufb01rst re-alized their existence and \ufb01rst investigated their properties. The rays were then de-tected by a calcium sul\ufb01de thread that glowed slightly in the dark whenthe rays were refracted through a prism of aluminum with sides angled atsixty degrees.46 MARIE CURIEBecquerel and three other scientists hypothesized that the phosphores-\ncent substance itself could produce X rays and that the cathode ray tubewas unnecessary. One manin particular, though, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin (1824\u20131907), fur-thered Becquerel\u2019s experiment by asking whether uranium rays electri\ufb01edthe air, as did X rays. Since they only knew that it emitted rays, the raysrepresented their starting point.\u201d\n8\nBy 1901, the Curies had divided their research into two parts, the iso-\nlation of radium and the study of the rays associated with radioactivity.

An unmarried German woman, Elsa Neumann(1872\u20131902), was writing a thesis in electrochemistry and would eventu-ally \ufb01nish it, but it seemed impossible for Curie to complete the arduousresearch necessary for the degree.Familiar with the scienti\ufb01c literature, she was aware of Wilhelm R\u00f6nt-gen\u2019s (1845\u20131923) discovery of X rays on November 8, 1895.T wo French investigators, Gustave LeBon (1841\u20131931) and Ren\u00e9 Blond-lot (1849\u20131930), claimed to have made such a discovery. Wood of JohnsTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 45Hopkins University to investigate. Recognition by contemporaries re\ufb02ects the impor-tance of a discovery on subsequent researchers. For example, althoughLeonardo da Vinci\u2019s (1452\u20131519) science is recognized today it had little48 MARIE CURIEimpact on Renaissance science because he kept his discoveries secret.\nBecquerel\u2019s new kind of ray intrigued Marie Curie, as she was searching\nfor a subject for her doctoral thesis. It was to-tally unsuitable for scienti\ufb01c instruments or for Marie\u2019s health.\nMarie \ufb01rst planned to detect a way of determining whether other sub-\nstances besides uranium caused the air to conduct electricity. In avery understated way, she reported her preliminary results on uranium asfollows:\nMy determinations showed that the emission of the rays is an\natomic property of the uranium, whatever the physical orTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 49chemical conditions of the salt were. If she did nothing else, this discovery would placeher in the ranks of \ufb01rst-rate scientists. Marie was positive that the strongradiation that they observed came from a new chemical element. Marie realized that only by actually isolatingthe element would she ever persuade the skeptics. Kirchhoff (1824\u20131887) \ufb01rst de-veloped a method for using spectroscopy to identify unknown elements inthe 1860s, and since that time eight previously undescribed elementswere discovered. Marie \ufb01rst boiled the pitchblende solution, then graduallycooled it, and \ufb01nally tested the crystals that were formed for radioactivitywith the Curie electrometer. He and Marie continued working and eventually came up with aproduct that was 330 times more active than uranium. Marie wrote, \u201cIn July, 1898, we announced the existence of thisTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 51new substance to which I gave the name of polonium, in memory of my\nnative country. Because ofthe connection with her native country, Marie felt that the discovery ofpolonium would be her most signi\ufb01cant contribution. Concluding that they had discovered not only onebut two radioactive substances in the pitchblende they named their sec-ond new element radium. In order to convince chemists of the correctness of her as-sumptions, Marie felt it necessary to produce a pure form of the new ele-ments. Thus, it was Marie who feltit necessary to go through the tedious procedures in order to have physi-cal evidence of their hypothesis.\nIn order to isolate the new elements, Marie needed a large quantity of\na source material.\nMarie, with Pierre\u2019s blessing, set out to hunt for the active substance inthe uranium ore, pitchblende.\n6\nSince to Pierre Curie it seemed super\ufb02uous to engage in the enormous\nphysical struggle to demonstrate what they already knew, much of the ex-hausting labor was left to Marie. When the physicist Georges UrbainTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 53(1872\u20131938) returned from a visit he reported that he \u201csaw Madame Curie\nwork like a man at the dif\ufb01cult treatments of great quantities of pitch-blende.Marie embraced the methods of the chemist, and Pierre, tired of the end-less extraction process, preferred the methods of the physicist. In 1898,Pierre, Marie, and B\u00e9mont noted in Comptes Rendus, a journal of the\nFrench Academy of Sciences, that\nT wo of us have shown that by purely chemical processes one\ncan extract from pitchblende a strongly radioactive substance. \u201d\n10\nPersistent Marie continued her efforts to purify radium.

The search for proof provided re-search opportunities for numerous scientists and technicians. Many people joinedthe search for another heretofore undiscovered new form of radiation.T wo French investigators, Gustave LeBon (1841\u20131931) and Ren\u00e9 Blond-lot (1849\u20131930), claimed to have made such a discovery. Another scientist, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel (1820\u20131891),had invented an instrument to identify new substances with phosphores-cent qualities\u2014even when they only phosphoresce for a very short time. Recognition by contemporaries re\ufb02ects the impor-tance of a discovery on subsequent researchers. For example, althoughLeonardo da Vinci\u2019s (1452\u20131519) science is recognized today it had little48 MARIE CURIEimpact on Renaissance science because he kept his discoveries secret. In avery understated way, she reported her preliminary results on uranium asfollows:\nMy determinations showed that the emission of the rays is an\natomic property of the uranium, whatever the physical orTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 49chemical conditions of the salt were. Kirchhoff (1824\u20131887) \ufb01rst de-veloped a method for using spectroscopy to identify unknown elements inthe 1860s, and since that time eight previously undescribed elementswere discovered. OnJune 6, 1898, she took a solution of bismuth nitrate that she was con-vinced contained her new element and added hydrogen sulphide to it. Marie wrote, \u201cIn July, 1898, we announced the existence of thisTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 51new substance to which I gave the name of polonium, in memory of my\nnative country.\u201d5\nIn the paper that they produced in 1898, the term \u201cradioactive\u201d was\n\ufb01rst used to describe the behavior of uranium-like materials. However, the en-tries in their laboratory notebook in November make it very clear thatthey had previously made another discovery that was to be even more sig-ni\ufb01cant. In 1900, the Curies collected all of the research onradioactivity that they could \ufb01nd and published it in a long paper.\u201d13\nHOME LIFE DURING THE RADIUM YEARS\nDuring the summer of 1898 after the discovery of polonium, Marie,\nPierre, and baby Ir\u00e8ne went on vacation in Auroux in the Auvergne, avery mountainous region of France. Curie,\u201d Nature, 21 July 1934, 90\u201391.", "Radioactive_Substance_1898": " He ob-served that a sheet of paper coated with the compound barium platino-cyanide glowed (luminesced or phosphoresced) even when the tube wasblocked off by the black cardboard and could not possibly have reachedthe barium platinocyanide. Although he clearly had observed a new typeof radiation, he was unable to establish its nature and coined the term X rays (unknown rays) for the new rays. Although it is prob-able that X rays had been produced by others before R\u00f6ntgen, he \ufb01rst re-alized their existence and \ufb01rst investigated their properties. Many people joinedthe search for another heretofore undiscovered new form of radiation.46 MARIE CURIEBecquerel and three other scientists hypothesized that the phosphores-\ncent substance itself could produce X rays and that the cathode ray tubewas unnecessary. HenriBecquerel, on the other hand, did not \ufb01nd X rays when he experimentedon phosphorescent substances. After negative results, he tried a differentphosphorescent substance\u2014a sample of uranium salts. These salts imme-diately produced radiation. He concludedthat it was the uranium in the mixture that caused the reaction. Contin-uing to explore the situation in his next four papers, Becquerel was con-vinced that it was the uranium that caused the image to be produced onthe photographic plates. He assumed that an energy (which he called a form of phosphores-\ncence) was stored in the uranium and concluded that the emission pro-duced by the uranium was the \ufb01rst example of a type of invisiblephosphorescence. Although he had actually discovered radioactivity,Becquerel neither named it nor explained its source. Thompson (1851\u20131916) inLondon put a small quantity of uranium nitrate over an aluminum-covered photographic plate and observed its effect. Thus by a quirk of luck, it is Becquerel, not Thompson,who is remembered and his experiment cited as producing the seminalwork in radioactivity. One manin particular, though, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin (1824\u20131907), fur-thered Becquerel\u2019s experiment by asking whether uranium rays electri\ufb01edthe air, as did X rays. She put the powdered uranium on one metal plate and opposed itwith a second plate. After testing dozens of materials, she found that thorium and itscompounds caused the air to conduct electricity and produced rays simi-lar to those from uranium. In avery understated way, she reported her preliminary results on uranium asfollows:\nMy determinations showed that the emission of the rays is an\natomic property of the uranium, whatever the physical orTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 49chemical conditions of the salt were. Any substance contain-\ning uranium is as much more active in emitting rays, as it con-tains more of this element.\n2\nIn other words, she realized that the activity of the uranium compoundsdepended solely on the amount of uranium present. It did not matter ifthe uranium salt was dry or wet, lumpy or powdery or what other elementswere present in the salt. It issued from the atom itself. Radiation was an atomicproperty, proportional to the amount of the radioactive substance beingmeasured. She concluded that thesetwo substances must contain other substances that were much more ac-tive than uranium.\n3\nIn addition to analyzing the pitchblende by known chemical methods,\nthe couple used Pierre\u2019s delicate electrical apparatus to examine differentportions for evidence of radioactivity. Marie was positive that the strongradiation that they observed came from a new chemical element. They then\nmeasured the radioactivity of the products. Their friend Gustave B\u00e9mont, who had the laboratoryexpertise that they lacked, heated a new sample of pitchblende in a glasstube and distilled a small quantity of the material on the glass. Marie \ufb01rst boiled the pitchblende solution, then graduallycooled it, and \ufb01nally tested the crystals that were formed for radioactivitywith the Curie electrometer. She discarded the crystals that were formed\ufb01rst, which were not radioactive or only slightly so. With each frac-tional crystallization, the crystals became increasingly more radioactive. Marie wrote, \u201cIn July, 1898, we announced the existence of thisTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM 51new substance to which I gave the name of polonium, in memory of my\nnative country.\u201d5\nIn the paper that they produced in 1898, the term \u201cradioactive\u201d was\n\ufb01rst used to describe the behavior of uranium-like materials. They found that the remaining liquid when they had gotten ridof both bismuth and polonium was still extremely radioactive. The re-maining impurity in the liquid was the element barium, which was knownnot to be radioactive. Concluding that they had discovered not only onebut two radioactive substances in the pitchblende they named their sec-ond new element radium. Radium was far more radioactive than polo-nium and 900 times more radioactive than uranium.\nMarie, with Pierre\u2019s blessing, set out to hunt for the active substance inthe uranium ore, pitchblende.\nTheir next problem was to \ufb01nd a place where they could store huge\nquantities of the radioactive substance.\u201d\n8\nBy 1901, the Curies had divided their research into two parts, the iso-\nlation of radium and the study of the rays associated with radioactivity. In 1898,Pierre, Marie, and B\u00e9mont noted in Comptes Rendus, a journal of the\nFrench Academy of Sciences, that\nT wo of us have shown that by purely chemical processes one\ncan extract from pitchblende a strongly radioactive substance. We have stated the opinion that pitchblende maypossibly contain a new element for which we have proposedthe name polonium.\n9\nIn an earlier article, the Curies had announced the existence of polo-\nnium, but in this later article, besides reminding their readers of polo-nium, the Curies also laid the foundation for their future assertion thatpitchblende contained another extremely radioactive element, radium.They described the properties of radium and explained why it could notbe a previously known element. They concluded in this paper \u201cthe vari-ous reasons which we have just enumerated lead us to believe that thenew radioactive substance contains a new element to which we proposeto give the name radium. Afterannouncing the result in her own name, Marie began to write her doc-toral thesis, \u201cResearches on Radioactive Substances.\nAlthough the isolation of radium scienti\ufb01cally took second place to\nthe early conclusion that radioactivity was atomic in nature, the isola-tion of the glowing blue radium was the stuff of legends and led others tofall under its charm. In 1900, the Curies collected all of the research onradioactivity that they could \ufb01nd and published it in a long paper. New forces contained within the nucleus of the atom would later be called upon to account for ra-dioactivity, but in 1900 the behavior of radioactive substances was anenigma. She alone was responsible for thelarge-scale chemical work required to separate radium from ra-dioactive residues in suf\ufb01cient quantity to purify it and obtainits atomic weight.\u201d13\nHOME LIFE DURING THE RADIUM YEARS\nDuring the summer of 1898 after the discovery of polonium, Marie,\nPierre, and baby Ir\u00e8ne went on vacation in Auroux in the Auvergne, avery mountainous region of France. His joint work with Marie resultingin the discovery of radium and polonium was widely accepted. Pierre and Henri Becquerelpublished a paper in 1901 in which they described burns on their skincaused by contact with radioactive material.Pierre duplicated an experiment by two Germans who were the \ufb01rst to re-port burns from radioactive materials in print.

Much like R\u00f6ntgen, Poin-car\u00e9 was fascinated by the process known as phosphorescence\u2014the glowcaused by light on certain substances. Poincar\u00e9 noted that X rayscaused phosphorescence both on the wall of the vacuum tube and on ascreen outside the tube, which was coated with a phosphorescent sub-stance.

Pierre, accompanied by Marie,made a trip to London to present an invited lecture at the Royal Institu-tion. This experience was especially meaningful to Marie, because theHugginses were also a collaborative scienti\ufb01c team. By the end of Sep-64 MARIE CURIEtember Marie pronounced herself cured, although the doctors found her\nanemic.\nOn the positive side, several honors and prizes came to Marie and\nPierre this year.Then in 1903 they presented the coveted Gegner prize for the third timeto Marie for scienti\ufb01c promise.\nIn the June 25, 1903, issue of an American popular journal, The Inde-\npendent, Marie Curie described her investigations on radioactive sub-\nstances. But\u201ca perusal of the following pages will show that Professor Curie is ratherthe helpmate of his wife in this magni\ufb01cent piece of scienti\ufb01c work.\u201d\n5\nMarie Curie demonstrated to the American public in this short articlethat she could succinctly present her ideas and discoveries in such a waythat the general educated public could understand them. In December 1903, the Curies and Henri Bec-querel were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. Pierre Curie wasnominated by four members of the Acad\u00e9mie to share the Nobel Prize forphysics with Henri Becquerel, completely leaving Marie out. Pierre answered Mittag-Lef\ufb02er\u2019s letter stating\u201cif it is true that one is seriously thinking about me [for the prize], I verymuch wish to be considered together with Madame Curie with respect toour research on radioactive bodies.\u201d\n7However, since Marie Curie had not\nbeen nominated for the 1903 prize it seemed as if she would be ineligible. Thus, they decided to give the Curies the prize in physics in 1903\u201cfor their joint researches on the radiation phenomenon discovered byProfessor Henri Becquerel.\nAs a woman Nobel Laureate, Marie Curie was an oddity in 1903 and\nwould still be so today. From Marie Curie\u2019s 1903 prize in physics through Christiane-Nusslein-Volhard\u2019s prize in physiology and medicine in 1995, there havebeen only eleven women Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, comparedto over 400 men from 1901 (when the \ufb01rst prize was given) through 2000.Marie Curie was more acceptable because she worked in collaborationwith her husband. T\u00f6rnebladh, the presi-\ndent of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, he noted that the suc-66 MARIE CURIEcess of the Curies illustrated an old proverb, \u201cunion is strength.\nThe fact that Marie shared the prize with two men is taken for granted\ntoday. But when the Curies were doing their research it was widely as-sumed that Marie was merely Pierre\u2019s assistant.\u201d Thus Pierre was prepared to see Marie as an equal partner. Marie ex-plained that \u201ctheir devotion and their common interest in science were tothem both a stimulant and a support.\u201d\n12Even more important than\nPierre\u2019s attitude, was Marie\u2019s own self-con\ufb01dence.\n14This publication\npolicy effectively enhanced the Curies\u2019 reputation as a collaborative cou-ple as well as helping to solidify Marie Curie\u2019s reputation as an indepen-dent scientist.\nCUTTING THE UNCUTTABLE\nEven though Marie Curie had postulated that radioactivity was atomic\nin nature, she still did not know what caused a substance to be radioac-tive.

This one was on polonium.\nCUTTING THE UNCUTTABLE\nEven though Marie Curie had postulated that radioactivity was atomic\nin nature, she still did not know what caused a substance to be radioac-tive. Rutherford interpreted these re-sults to mean that most of the mass of an atom was concentrated into acompact positive nucleus with electrons occupying most of the atom\u2019sspace. Theuncut atom was now hypothesized to be composed of three different par-ticles, a positive proton, a neutral neutron, and a negative electron. By1913, a picture of the atom was conceived that resembled the one that isaccepted today with a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons sur-rounded by electrons. Marie Curie proposed two possible explanations\u2014ei-ther the radioactive substances were borrowing energy from an externalsource and then releasing it, or that the radium was the source of the en-ergy itself. He blew air across samples of thorium and foundthat he could collect a radioactive gas, which he called thorium emana-tion. If an emanation cameinto contact with a substance that was not radioactive, the radioactivityof the emanation would be transferred to the new substance. Working to-gether they showed that radioactive elements by giving out either alphaor beta rays would break down into intermediate elements. By building on the work of the Curies and oth-ers, they had made a discovery that explained the nature of radioactivity. The radioactive materials could transmute all bythemselves.

The Norwegian chemist Ellen Gleditsch (1879\u20131968), while\nworking in Curie\u2019s laboratory, tested a claim by the British chemist Wil-liam Ramsay (1852\u20131916) that radium was descended from uranium. Among other accomplishments she found that thesolubility of radium emanation (radon) varied with the solvent used andthe temperature.\nIt was becoming more and more dif\ufb01cult to ignore the harmful effects\nof radium. She was unprepared to acknowledge that radium, her so-calledchild, could endanger people.\nAs radium developed into an industry, something that Curie never an-\nticipated nor desired, the evidence of deleterious effects began to accu-mulate. She recognized that certain local effects of radium could beharmful.\nSome of the reports emanating from London caused scientists and lab-\noratory workers with radium to worry about their own health. Oneof the women who had worked with Curie in 1907, Norwegian scientistEllen Gleditsch (1879\u20131968), was appointed to a committee to inquireabout the effects of radium. Ra-dium Corporation. By 1928, 15 deaths were attrib-uted to radium exposure.These deaths opposed all that was known about radium exposure.\nRadium as a cure for cancer had been on everyone\u2019s lips for several\nyears. All that Mariewas able to do was to refer her to Regaud, who was the director of themedical part of the Radium Institute.\nThe death toll from radium increased. Reports of deaths in radium lab-\noratories and factories abounded. Marie still was unable to admit to her own laboratory workers herfears about radium\u2019s effects. Meloney managed to accumulate enough money for a sec-ond gram of radium. \u201d\n4\nThe presentation of the radium gift of $50,000 was made the next day,\nOctober 30, 1929. Unlike eight years previously when President Harding presenteda gram of radium to Mme. Curie, radium could no longer be bought in theUnited States. At this\ntime she inaugurated the Radium Institute of Warsaw. Bronia\u2019s organi-zation and Marie\u2019s fund-raising for the radium had succeeded. She did notbene\ufb01t from the discovery of radium, insisting that scienti\ufb01c discoveriesbelonged to the world. Always a private and some-what dif\ufb01dent person, Marie con\ufb01ded to Missy Meloney her most ferventwish\u2014that the radium would remain in her laboratory after her death andthat Ir\u00e8ne would inherit it. The newspaper reported that \u201chermany years of exposure to radium have had their effect on MadameCurie\u2019s health,\u201d but that she, nevertheless, continued to administer theInstitute, personally direct her staff\u2019s researchers, and gave two lectures aweek as a professor of physics at the University. Her heart remained strongbut the villain in the case, radium, proved stronger. Robert Millikan (1868\u20131953), head of the California In-\nstitute of Technology, characterized Curie\u2019s discoveries of radium and theradiation emitted by it as \u201ca starting point of the newer developments inphysics.

Since radium itself had become immensely valuable, shedid not want to risk the loss of any of the rare material. Thus the materialthat she placed at the disposal of the Health Service was not the radiumitself but the emanation that it sporadically emitted. If the radon was drawn off from the radium that formed itand was sealed in thin glass tubes, these tubes could be inserted into thebody wherever they were needed leaving the radium itself intact.

Her interests and person-\nality were much like Marie\u2019s. She also was very soft\nhearted, and when Marie Curie was con\ufb01ned to her bed after several un-successful cataract operations, Eve provided the support for her mother. From thistime on, Marie Curie had support from both of her daughters\u2014Ir\u00e8ne washer companion in scienti\ufb01c enterprises and Eve in domestic ones. Surely she recalled her early collabora-tion with Pierre Curie and recognized that her daughter was seeking thesame kind of relationship. Marie Curie herself feared that the outgoing Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricwould hurt the daughter in which she had invested so much of herself. Just as Marie and Pierre Curie had jointly wonthe Nobel Prize in 1903, Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie went on to winthe coveted Nobel in 1935 for their work in arti\ufb01cial radioactivity.\nAs she grew older Marie Curie spent more and more time raising\nmoney for her laboratory and less in creative research herself.

The same Marie Curie who declinedany kind of patent rights from radium insisted in the 1930s that govern-ments should reward creative scientists by establishing some type of roy-alty payment for those scientists whose discoveries bene\ufb01ted humankind.Marie Curie and Jean Perrin became activists on the part of scientists.\nAs Marie became less able to work than she had previously, Ir\u00e8ne and\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie took on additional responsibilities. Ir\u00e8ne was like134 MARIE CURIEher mother, but Fred was outgoing and jolly.\nAs Marie became more feeble, Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie had a\ndaughter, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, born in 1927; they later had a son, Pierre, born in 1932. Although Marie Curie adored her smallgranddaughter, she was as unemotional when dealing with the child as shehad been with her own two daughters. Marie Curie was convinced that she would not live muchlonger.\nAccording to an article in the January 1, 1933, Sunday New York Times\nMagazine, Marie Curie was still the active head of the Curie Institute.\n9\nIn December 1933, Marie suffered from a large stone in her gall blad-\nder.
