The authorities were\nconcerned we might \u201cinfect\u201d the other prisoners with our political views.\nThis became our core group of about twenty prisoners. It was a hardship station not only for the prisoners but for the prison staff. I demanded to see the head of the prison and made a list of\n\n\fcomplaints.", "Political_Prisoners_1950": " All political prisoners, or what the authorities called \u201csecurity prisoners,\u201d were automatically\nclassified as D on admission. It normally took years for a political prisoner to raise his status from D to\nC. It was corrupt and demeaning, another way of repressing prisoners in general and political prisoners in\nparticular. We demanded that all political prisoners be in one category. But the prison authorities wielded the classification\nsystem as a weapon against political prisoners, threatening to lower our hard-won classifications in order to control our behavior.\u201d\nEvery six months, prisoners were called before the prison board to have their classifications evaluated. Shortly afterward, we agreed among ourselves not to discuss politics with the prison board. I found this one of the most\ninhumane restrictions of the prison system. Visits were a maximum of thirty minutes long, and\npolitical prisoners were not permitted contact visits, in which the visitor and prisoner were in the same room. On the prisoner\u2019s side, there was a row of five cubicles with small square\npieces of glass that looked out on identical cubicles on the other side. The campaign to improve conditions in prison was part of the apartheid struggle.\n\nShortly after we started working at the quarry, we were joined in Section B by a number of other prominent political prisoners.\nTo counterbalance the effect of these new political allies, the authorities also put a handful of common-law prisoners in our section. There was a nonpolitical prisoner among us, nicknamed Joe My Baby,\nwho later joined the ANC and proved invaluable in helping us smuggle material in and out of prison. I was brought to the Head Office, where I was confronted by prison officials. Most of the men did so and even though they were\nD Group prisoners, permission was granted. For years, we\nwere not permitted to receive funds except from our families, so that poor prisoners rarely had money for books or tuition. As freedom fighters and political prisoners, we\nhad an obligation to improve and strengthen ourselves, and study was one of the few opportunities to do so.\nThe tension between prisoners and warders had lessened somewhat. His reputation preceded him, for his name was a byword among prisoners for\nbrutality. It was a policy of selective intimidation, and the decision on who would be charged\nwas taken regardless of how hard that prisoner had worked that day. When we were trudging back to our cells, Van Rensburg would read from a\nlist, \u201cMandela [or Sisulu or Kathrada], I want to see you immediately in front of the head of prison. Fiks, who was working toward a law degree, was a\nbright, resourceful fellow who had become the head of the prisoners\u2019 committee in our section. \u201cThe general prisoners carry the \u2018suitcases\u2019 of their warders, but we won\u2019t carry yours \u2014 so we call you\nSuitcase. Suzman was one of the few, if not the only, members of Parliament who took an interest in the plight of political prisoners. Virtually every one of the ANC\u2019s\nsenior leaders was either in jail or in exile. We heard from some of our men that the most senior PAC prisoners had\nexpressed regret that we had not been hanged. Instead, we\nmade decisions about such matters as prisoners\u2019 complaints, strikes, mail, food \u2014 all of the day-to-day concerns of prison life.\nIn the first few years on the island, the High Organ also acted as a representative committee for all the political prisoners in our section.\nNeville\u2019s original suggestion eventually turned into a prisoners\u2019 committee composed of people from all political parties. Eventually the committee became\nknown as Ulundi, and acted as a disciplinary committee for all political prisoners. I advocated that we should remain seated, as it was demeaning to\nhave to recognize the enemy when he did not recognize us as political prisoners. This was a novel experience: my comrades and fellow prisoners were\nnow official visitors.\u201d I mentioned that my new\naccommodations were superior, and maybe this would set a precedent for all political prisoners.\n\nThat month, I had another homecoming: I returned to Robben Island in order to persuade twenty-five MK political prisoners to accept the\ngovernment\u2019s offer of amnesty and leave the island.", "Political_Prisoners_1920": " The movie reminded me once again that on the day I did walk out of prison, I did not want to appear to be a political fossil from an age long\npast.\u201d The number of general prisoners had been\ndrastically reduced.
