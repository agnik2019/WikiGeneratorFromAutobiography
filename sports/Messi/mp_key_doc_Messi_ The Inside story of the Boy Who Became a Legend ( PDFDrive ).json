At that time Messi had a contract with \nNike, just for sportswear: in exchange for his image, they \nsupplied him with trainers, clothes, etc. In 2003 Messi was only sixteen \nyears old and already a multinational company like Adidas was \ntrying to \u2018steal\u2019 him from the competition \u2026\u2018It\u2019s our job to be on the lookout for the stars of the future. I played 112 Messi\nfootball. And five years ago all of them were saying \nthat Messi was the gem in the Bar\u00e7a youth squad. I see him play in the \nUnder 20 World Cup in 2005, wearing Nike gear. Messi is \nalready a first-team player at Bar\u00e7a and things go very well for him in Holland. At that moment I think some very inter -\nesting offers start to land on Messi\u2019s doorstep from other European clubs, like Juventus. Why, when Messi first wore his \nAdidas Predator outfit and scored a goal against Zaragoza in the \nCopa del Rey did Nike scream at the top of their voices: \u2018Messi has a deal with us and we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes for him to \nhonour it\u2019.\u2019\nLet\u2019s talk about your campaign, \u2018Impossible is Nothing\u2019, in which \nMessi is one of the key figures. The former Barcelona coach is relaxed, he has no \nurgent appointments and he willingly speaks at length, dis-\ncussing the little boy who debuted with the first team on 16 October 2003.\nYou played impassioned games with Milan against the Napoli of \nMaradona, and you were Messi\u2019s coach for five years. Messi is still very young, he has his whole career ahead of him.\n\u2018I have seen a lot of football, many great players and many \nmore goals \u2026 I have to say that Leo\u2019s goal against Getafe 176 Messi\nwas one of the most spectacular that I have seen. Sylvinho, Deco, Ronaldinho, they\u2019ve helped \nand advised him.\u2019178 Messi\nLike when he was injured against Chelsea and you hugged him as \nif you were his father.\u2019\nRijkaard lights another cigarette and then, continuing \nhis train of thought, adds:\n\u2018There is a sense that Maradona used to transmit, and \nnow Messi also transmits, the joy of playing.", "Messi_2005": "\n\u2018It\u2019s true, I am proud of that victory on both a personal \nlevel and as part of the team, I\u2019m proud of what the boys did, and of players like Messi, Ag\u00fcero and Gago, who made a name for themselves at international level.\u2019\nDo you remember the first time you saw Messi. That\u2019s why, after discussing it with Hugo, we 94 Messi\nalways brought him on in the second half, where he could \nmake a difference.\u2019\nYou say that Messi was always happy when he was on the pitch \nwith the ball \u2026\n\u2018Yes, it bears repeating that Leo loves to play, and the foot-ball is his favourite toy; he has so much fun with it and he \ncan control it like nobody else. But Messi doesn\u2019t \nneed to be compared to anyone, he is a brilliant and unique \nfootballer, a great one, one who can create surprises in every game and that is what people love about him.\u2019\nWhat did that Under 20 World Cup mean to Messi. Best player, high-\nest scorer of the tournament, those two goals of his in the \nfinal \u2026 He was already a star, the footballer that an entire nation had been waiting for. But Messi stayed on the bench. Who else could have brought the best out of an eighteen-year-old boy like Messi.\n\u2018I think Messi keeps on progressing and for the moment \nhe has no limits. He progresses while keeping the same low 96 Messi\nprofile as always. Messi is neither on the pitch nor on the bench. The explanation is given via an official announcement:\n\u2018FC Barcelona has decided not to play Leo Messi in the \nmatch against Alav\u00e9s as a matter of caution, in light of the outstanding legal issue that will shortly be resolved within \nthe confines of federal regulation relating to non-EU \nplayers. Messi meets all of 102 Messi\nthe required criteria to fulfil this regulation, which means \nthat despite the club\u2019s three non-EU positions already being \nfilled by Ronaldinho, Eto\u2019o and M\u00e1rquez, he should be able \nto play. It is 1 May 2005, the Nou Camp scoreboard indicates that there are three minutes remaining, and \nBar\u00e7a are 1-0 up against Albacete. \nHe is the youngest player in the club\u2019s history to score in a league game (a record later broken on 20 October 2007, \nwhen Bojan Krki\u00b4 c scored against Villarreal).\nThings have gone well for him in the first team, but after \nthat 1 May match, the Argentine will not play another offi-cial match that season \u2013 not even after Bar\u00e7a have done \nenough to ensure their seventeenth league title. Messi is an unresolved case. The Italian club\u2019s presi-\ndent, Massimo Moratti, has never tried to hide his interest \nin the player and has even made a financially attractive offer to Jorge Messi \u2013 who tries to use this bargaining chip to put \npressure on Barcelona to resolve the issue.\nMeanwhile, on 31 August (the closing date for new team \nsignings), FC Barcelona renew Messi\u2019s licence as a youth player naturalised in the team that plays in the Second \nDivision B. And on 16 September, the news that the player 104 Messi\nhas signed a professional contract goes public. \u2018A week after his eighteenth birthday, Leo Messi has received his greatest present. Team \nsecretary Txiki Begiristain has travelled to Utrecht, Holland, \nwith the player\u2019s father, in order to draw up his new con-tract, which guarantees him a place at the club until 2010,\u2019 \nreads the Bar\u00e7a website on 30 June, while the youngster is \nplaying in the FIFA Under 20 World Cup.\nThere are various theories about this discrepancy over \ndates: some maintain that Messi, now legally an adult,  \nsimply  accepted the new deal; others reckon that the  \ncontract was ultimately modified in September, because \nthe player\u2019s father was not satisfied with some of the clauses \nabout incentives; there are those who think that the length of the contract was increased, from the usual five years \nto the final nine; still others believe that the September \nagreement was nothing more than a declaration of intent, implying that a professional contact would be signed in \naccordance with all regulations the following year. One \nthing for sure is that Messi cannot play in the league.00pm, Lionel Andr\u00e9s \nMessi Cuccittini appears before Fernando Alberti Vecino, \nthe judge presiding over the civil register, and proclaims \u2018that he does not renounce his Argentine nationality; that \nhe swears allegiance to the King and obedience to the \nConstitution and Spanish laws; that he chooses Catalan civil residency; and that he petitions for the right to be inscribed \ninto the Spanish civil register\u2019. Because \u2018Barcelona could not arrange Messi\u2019s professional licence before 31 August, the date when the \nwindow for such licences closes, since at that point he was \nstill a foreigner,\u2019 explains Javier Tebas, who is not only the legal advisor for Alav\u00e9s, but also vice president of the PFL. \n\u2018Now they have given him Spanish nationality and have \nobtained a youth licence for him, with the intention of backdating it to 31 August and with the hope of playing \nhim, despite the fact that the window for new signings is \nclosed. Moreover, \u2018given the contract that has been signed, how can Messi play with his youth team licence for the first team. They are stirring \nup trouble to prevent Messi from playing with Bar\u00e7a.\nBut the past does not come back to haunt Bar\u00e7a. One thing for sure is that the Messi case ends up \nall over the sports pages across the country and provokes \na scandal in Argentina. The first ruling from the Spanish Football Federation\u2019s Competition Committee appears on \n18 October, stating that \u2018due to his naturalisation, Messi \ncan continue to play as a Spaniard\u2019. \nThanks to his achievements in the Under 20 World Cup, \nMessi steamrollers his opponents: Wayne Rooney only \nscores 127 points against the Argentine\u2019s 225. And that\u2019s nothing Soap opera  109\ncompared to the latest campaigns, like the one with the \nMessiah who ascends to the heavens for A-Style, an Italian \ncaps and sportswear brand, or the one where Messi appears \ndisguised as a footballing grandma for an Air Europa advert at the end of 2007.\nBut there is no point wasting time describing images, it \nwould be easier just to go to YouTube to see how advertisers have made use of the image and abilities of Messi the jug-\ngler to sell anything and everything. His name is Leo Messi and there is every reason to \nbelieve that we are in the presence of an exceptional player, the most brilliant to appear in recent years. In that match, before Bar\u00e7a appeared, \nMessi appeared \u2013 he was surprising, skilful, speedy, intelli-gent, and he showed great courage.\u2019124 Messi\nWhat was his most impressive attribute. Messi amazes \nme in the way that he knows how to make so many decisions \nat such high speed without getting it wrong \u2026 Perhaps he \ndoesn\u2019t have the imagination of Ronaldinho or the other great Brazilians, perhaps he doesn\u2019t have the vision or the \ngame plan of a Maradona, but he has a supersonic aesthetic. He \nrepresents an interesting model: his Argentine roots are continuously apparent and, at the same time, he belongs to a culture and a style of play that is profoundly \u201cBarcelonan\u201d.\u2019\nHow has Messi changed since that match. Now Messi is the footballing leader of Bar\u00e7a and he has to \nlead his national team as well.\n\u2018What concerns me is the possibility of Messi losing speed. I don\u2019t know \u2026 Will he end up like Ronaldo, \nwho became a specialist in having six good moments per \nmatch and a 20-metre sprint.", "Messi_1978": " Many predict he will be crowned best World Cup player and highest goal scorer. He has just had a spectacular season: Ballon \nd\u2019Or, Liga and Champions League winner. Twenty-eight years old, born in Buenos Aires, an attacking midfielder, he plays for Villarreal and as \nyet has no World Cup on his CV, but selector Jos\u00e9 Pekerman \nhas put his trust in him.  132 Messi\nHe is a silent footballer, charged with the responsibility of \nleading the team. And \nMessi. Well \u2026 Messi is in the running in the category of \nmedium-level stars, or rather, promising youngsters. He has been dubbed the new Maradona and the World Cup should \nbe his chance to surprise the whole world at just eighteen \nyears of age, after establishing himself on the international scene at Stamford Bridge.\nAlong with the Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo and the \nEcuadorian Luis Valencia, fans have included him in the list of six candidates from whom the best young World Cup \nplayer will be chosen (the other three, nominated by FIFA, \nare Cesc F\u00e0bregas, the Swiss player Tranquillo Barnetta and the German Thomas Podolski). The Argentines want to see Messi in the starting line-\nup and they have pinned all their hopes on him; they want \nto see confirmation of all the amazing stories that are told across Europe about the heir to Maradona \u2013 and they want \nthat confirmation in the shape of a national shirt. When it came down to it, it was Maradona himself who, a few months previously, asked \nthat the number 10 shirt be given to Messi \u2013 a shirt number \nwhich the Argentine Federation had retired in his honour.\nHe has recently been invited into the group, thanks \nto his success in the Under 20 World Cup. The Hungarian grabs him by his brand-new \nnumber 18 shirt; Messi lifts his arm and pushes him back. As is already obvious, Messi is shy. There is no \nshortage of anecdotes illustrating this, like the time during \ntraining in Madrid when the boss invites the whole squad 134 Messi\nto a barbecue \u2013 an Argentine social ritual par excellence \u2013 \nin order to encourage group bonding. And Messi does \nnot even emerge from his silence in order to conform to \nexpected formalities. At Christmas, for example, when all the Argentine players go over to visit the manager after \nspending time with their families, Messi does not show up. And without ignoring the issue of unwritten rules, which are steeped in history, it has to be \nsaid that Messi is young \u2013 too young. To draw parallels yet \nagain, at eighteen years of age, despite being an emerging figure, Maradona was not even selected by C\u00e9sar Bilardo for \nthe 1978 World Cup. Messi is in Germany, but it should be \nremembered that no Argentine player since the 1930s has played in the final stages of the competition at only eight-\neen years old. Messi is seemingly \ncompletely recovered; he has already played various friend-lies before the World Cup; but there are those in the dress-\ning room who say his muscles are still bothering him. During a training session five days earlier, Messi suffered a contusion, making it difficult \nfor him to play. He watches as 136 Messi\nRiquelme, in a moment of divine inspiration, looks into the \nstands and sends the ball exactly where it needed to go. In short, at the Gelsenkirchen stadium on 16 June, Messi is \non the bench again. He has Carlos T\u00e9vez to keep him com-\npany, and 65 minutes to witness three goals and wonder how many he could score. His \nWorld Cup debut comes in the 74th minute. He comes on for Maxi Rodr\u00edguez, joining the game at the same time as \nCarlos T\u00e9vez, the other youngster on the team.\u2019 The demand of one little girl brandishing a placard \u2013 \u2018Jos\u00e9, \nlet Messi play (please)\u2019 \u2013 is finally answered. In the 87th minute T\u00e9vez passes to Crespo, who passes back to T\u00e9vez who, after \nhaving scored the fifth goal, shows his generosity by sending \nthe ball down to Messi, who is motoring up the right wing. \u2018His country \nwants him to play Messi from the start. And not to wait until 138 Messi\nthe 74th minute. No one doubts that Messi will give him the same over \n90 minutes that he gives in fifteen. Pekerman can kill two birds \nwith one stone: T\u00e9vez and Messi in the starting line-up, Saviola and Crespo rested to avoid any yellow cards that \ncould mean missing the next match.\nOn 21 June at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, Lionel is \nawaited by Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, Franz Beckenbauer and, of course, Diego Armando Maradona, dressed inevita-\nbly in his Albiceleste shirt. The following day it will be Not even a single minute  139\ntwenty years since Diego scored two goals against England \nin the 1986 World Cup, one with the hand and one with the \nfoot. When Messi \ncomes on for Saviola, the score is 1-1. And it is then that the boy from Bar\u00e7a \nchanges the team\u2019s rhythm, he gives it the necessary depth \nand sends the ball from foot to foot, building up to an 140 Messi\namazing  Maxi Rodr\u00edguez goal. \nThere are 120 minutes of play, of which Leo Messi plays not even a single minute. To rectify the situation \nwould have required speed, skill and creativity, which Cruz does not possess and which T\u00e9vez can no longer muster \ndue to tiredness after playing for the length of the match. \nEssentially, they needed Messi. \u2018In that moment we needed a striker in the \nbox and that\u2019s not Messi,\u2019 he explains in the press room \nafter the tears, after the fight between Oliver Bierhoff, Frings and Cruz, and before announcing his resignation. \n\u2018We were always considering him [Messi] as a good option, \nI knew we could count on him,\u2019 says the manager. Mystery: Only the manager will ever know the truth and \nit will go down in Argentine footballing history as one of its many secrets, like Ratt\u00edn\u2019s sending off in England in \u201966, \nMaradona\u2019s drug-taking in the United States in \u201994, or the \nred card against Ortega in France in \u201998. In other words, Messi says he wants to play and this irritates team leaders \nlike Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme and the captain, Fabi\u00e1n Ayala, \nwho ensure their feelings do not go unnoticed and call him to order at a press conference. They are the ones who con-\nvince the coach to leave Messi out of the starting eleven.142 Messi\n4. A year later, in an interview with \nsports magazine Marca, when they ask: \u2018What happened \nwith Messi. \nIn Argentina the problem is that we have so much faith that just a little bit of Messi gets us very excitable. And people \nwere expecting Messi to be the great Maradona of this World \nCup. And he was just taking his first steps with Argentina, a great team.\u2019\nAnd Leo Messi.", "Messi_2006": "\nLet\u2019s talk about Messi, a footballer who started out at Newell\u2019s, \nlike you. Let\u2019s begin at the 2006 World Cup. That said, \nI\u2019m with those who thought it was a shame that Argentina \ncollapsed without Messi. In the last match many things hap-pened: Abbondanzieri was injured, Riquelme got tired, \nArgentina were 1-0 up \u2013 all factors that penalised Messi. Germany were not getting anywhere, but the truth is that in their desperation to equal-\nise Messi could have taken advantage of the opposition \u2019s 144 Messi\ndisorder to score another goal.\u2019\nAnd while we\u2019re on the topic, there has been much talk about \nMessi\u2019s youth, his maturity, the etiquette of Argentine football and \nthe dressing room \u2026\n\u2018Maradona played in his first World Cup when he was 21 and it was not a happy experience. With Messi there was positive discrimi-\nnation: we were thinking that if he had played he would have turned the match around \u2026\u2019\nNow that we have dealt with that topic, let\u2019s talk about Messi and \nMaradona. Messi is more intense than that. Diego \nsometimes used to put his foot on the accelerator, whereas \nMessi lives with the pedal to the floor. He can\u2019t always be Messi, because if \nyou\u2019re continually explosive then the opposition will have their guard up constantly and it\u2019s more difficult to surprise \nthem. Messi needs his team-mates to pass him the ball, after that he does \nthe rest on his own. Messi\u2019s game requires him to be explosive, so it is \nimperative he stays in perfect shape.\u2019\nWhat do you think of Messi today. He could dominate this dec-\nade, along with Cristiano Ronaldo.", "Messi_2007": "147Chapter 25\nThe devil\n10 March 2007\nBarcelona \u2013 This time, Don Fabio\u2019s nightmare is about \na nineteen-year-old boy, Leo Messi. The standard prediction is that the ball will be controlled by the Blaugrana, the favourites, spread across the pitch in a daring 3-4-3 formation, so that Madrid are even less 148 Messi\nmarked than usual. Leo Messi comes on after just five minutes. One \nof the most nervous on the Bar\u00e7a team is Oleguer: he is to end up being sent off in the 45th minute after receiv-ing his second booking (for a foul on Gago). Leo Messi is proving a nightmare \nagain, as he latches onto a rebound from Casillas. He does what he does best, unbalancing two or three opponents, doing a one-two with Eto\u2019o and shooting at Casillas, who manages to get a hand to it at first, but can do nothing about Messi\u2019s sudden rebound. No, along comes Messi to save Bar\u00e7a and keep Madrid at arm\u2019s length.\nLuca Caioli, Corriere della Sera, 11 March 2007\nYes, Capello \u2026 at best he had forgotten what Messi was \ncapable of doing. 2-0 to the Whites \nand everyone at home happy, with a Messi who had put \nin a good effort for at least 70 minutes, with a repertoire of left-footers, assists that were wasted by his team-mates, 150 Messi\nand breakthroughs into the box. Has Messi got something \nagainst Don Fabio, who is currently the England manager. \n\u2018Playing against Real Madrid,\u2019 says Messi, \u2018is always par -\nticularly motivating for any player. In the 26th minute, Messi\u2019s spectacular \nchange of pace traps Roberto Carlos. Bar\u00e7a are within reach of the second goal. In the 40th minute, Ronaldinho slaloms and crosses to Messi, but the \nheader is wide of the goalpost. In the 47th minute Messi \ntries again. In the 55th minute Casillas denies Messi\u2019s third shot. In the 69th \nminute, Messi is replaced by Iniesta. Against Real Madrid, Bar\u00e7a have to \nlose the player who made all the difference at the start of the season.\nPause for a question: Why does Messi endure so many \ntears and breaks, to the point where people are already call-ing him \u2018the porcelain star\u2019. In Messi\u2019s case, \nsome people also factor in his physical particulars, his mus-\ncular and bone structure and his growth problems, stimu-lated by hormones. \u2018They told me,\u2019 explains Jorge \nMessi, \u2018that his muscular mass is made up of explosive fibres, \nlike those of a sprinter.\u2019 He manages to score a hat-trick, his \nfirst at the top level (he had previously scored more goals \nin a match, but only on a small ground of little importance) and although it doesn\u2019t seal a victory for the team it is at \nleast enough to save Bar\u00e7a\u2019s skin in extremis. After the third goal Messi runs along and repeats the gesture, because \u2018I owe a lot to \nBar\u00e7a for what they did for me when they had the chance, \nand also to the fans for all the affection they have shown towards me, especially in these difficult few months. Two very weak and sad seasons for \nBar\u00e7a. And for the defender who arrived in Barcelona after \nhaving won the Germany World Cup with the Azzurri (the \nBlues \u2013 the Italian national team). But in the Nou Camp dressing room and on the pitch the current Milan player \nhad time to get a close-up of Messi and evaluate him.\nWhat do you think of Leo Messi.\u2019\nDo you remember the Bar\u00e7a-Real Madrid match on 10 March 2007.\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t at the ground but Messi\u2019s performance had a big impact on me. And all this in an incred-\nibly difficult  fixture, agonising, tense, hugely competitive; 156 Messi\nall derbies are like that of course, but the truth is that the \none in 2007 was particularly tough. Try to take a ball away from Messi.159Chapter 27\nLeo and Diego\n18 April 2007\n\u2018Barcelona Football Club are regaining ground.\nXavi \u2026\nMessi swerves round Paredes.\nMessi makes it all the way to Alexis, still with the \nball.The ball looks like it\u2019s going wide \u2026Messi scores.He has left four Getafe players and the goalie in the \ndust. Nothing like the usual Messi. I don\u2019t mean to say that Messi is Maradona, but it reminds me of that goal.\nMaradona has the ball. Maradona. When the Golden Boy scored that goal, Messi the Flea still had not been born yet. The Marca front 162 Messi\npage headline reads: \u2018Twenty years, ten months and 26 \ndays later, Messi repeats Maradona\u2019s goal.62 per cent prefer Messi\u2019s goal, while 39. The result is the same on the Cadena Ser radio station, although the \nmargins are closer: Messi wins with 52 per cent to Diego\u2019s \n48 per cent. As well as the debate over which goal is better, another question \narises: that of Messi\u2019s intentions, or in other words, to quote La Naci\u00f3n, \u2018Was Messi trying to imitate Maradona. \u2018Perhaps the play was \nsimilar, I have only seen it once on television,\u2019 declares Messi, \u2018but I never thought it could be the same as Diego\u2019s goal. Valdano \noffered Maradona the chance to pass; in Messi\u2019s case it was Eto\u2019o.\u2019\nThe same holds true in Messi\u2019s case. \u2018He told me,\u2019 reveals Messi, \u2018that with all the great goals everyone talks a lot about \nthe goal, but he passed it to me and yet no one mentions \nit.\u2019166 Messi\nDiego Armando Maradona is in hospital. And during the inter -\nview with his friend Marcelo Tinelli, he also finds time to \ntalk about Messi\u2019s goal. To start with, my goal was more beautiful \nthan Messi\u2019s. \u2018What was the first thing you \nfelt after seeing Messi\u2019s goal against Getafe.Leo and Diego  167\nHere is the commentary that was broadcast on one \nArgentine TV station:\n\u2018Now it\u2019s Messi.\nIt\u2019s Messi who faces up to the opposition,\nMessi to Eto\u2019o in the area.Zambrotta \u2026Messi couldn\u2019t get there \u2026With his hand, with his hand, like Diego. With \nhis jump, Messi overpowers Carlos Kameni, who is 19cm \ntaller than he is.\u2019 Just after the match, Messi is only \nsorry that the goal \u2018didn\u2019t gain anything; it only won us one \npoint\u2019 and not the league.\nDiego and Lionel, Messi and Maradona, the disciple \nand the master.\nIn 2004 he debuted with Bar\u00e7a\nAnd his dream was realised with the Under 20s(The Golden Foot has arrived.\nNow Messi has his own songwriter, just as Maradona had El \nPotro Rodrigo. \u2018Messi is the closest I \nhave seen to Diego. You\u2019d have to kill 170 Messi\nhim to stop him.\u2019\nSince then there have been many who have talked about \nit, in every stage of the Bar\u00e7a number 19\u2019s career. But Diego had that game-altering vision \nwhich Messi lacks. \u2018Messi is \nlike Maradona but with a turbo attached to his feet.\u2019 Nor do footballers past and present, like Eto\u2019o: \u2018Messi is the Diego Armando Maradona of the future\u2019, or Deco: \u2018He \nreminds me a lot of Maradona.\u2019 Some do \nnot deny the parallels, but they have words of warning for Messi. \u2018Between Messi and Maradona,\u2019 maintains H\u00e9ctor \n\u2018El Negro\u2019 Enrique, \u201986 World Champion with Argentina, \n\u2018there are two things they have in common: their running style and their speed. O Rei (\u2018The King\u2019 \u2013 Pel\u00e9\u2019s nickname) is convinced that \u2018Messi is a dif-\nferent guy. Messi is \na bit quicker. Messi is a very good player, left-footed, skilled, powerful, he plays for \nBarcelona and he\u2019s Argentine. But he is not Maradona, he \nis Messi.\u2019 Writer, journalist and psychologist Walter Vargas is categorical, maintaining in his book, Football Delivery: \u2018Messi \nis not and never will be Maradona. \nThey show that Messi and Maradona share a series of physi-\ncal traits: low centre of gravity, muscle mass, height, weight, development and, of course, they are both left-footed. He has seen 172 Messi\nMaradona play and he won\u2019t hear of any comparisons. He \nlists Messi\u2019s weaknesses, from his taking of free kicks to his \nvision of the game, and he glorifies Maradona\u2019s gifts, asking his inquirer if he remembers the number 10\u2019s first goals \nwith the Argentinos Juniors. Let\u2019s move on to Luis, who \nhas a photo of Maradona in action in his completely bostero \n(Boca fan) shop, with the inscription, \u2018Your children and \nyour children\u2019s children will ask about him. Two of them are wearing Barcelona shirts with \nMessi\u2019s name across their backs. Juli\u00e1n, aged ten, the most \nchatty of them all, says emphatically: \u2018I\u2019m a Boca fan, but I like Messi, I like the way he plays. \nAnd the same thing happens to Messi,\u2019 explains Horacio \nDel Prado, commentator for Radio Nacional in Argentina. \u2018The old folks who maintain that Messi will never reach the \nlevel of Maradona forget what everyone always says when a \nnew superstar appears: he\u2019ll never make it. Even more so when there are so many coincidences, as there are in Messi\u2019s case: little; \nleft-footed; grew up at Newell\u2019s, where Maradona spent a \nbrief stint; matured at Barcelona, the first European club to experience \u2018Maramondo\u2019; Under 20 world champion, like \nMaradona in 1979. Instead let\u2019s take a look at the headlines:\n\u2018Messi is worth the whole team\u2019 \u2013 El Pa\u00eds, 20/09/07\n\u2018Messi plays Messiah\u2019 \u2013 Marca, 23/09/07\u2018Messi dominates\u2019 \u2013 El Mundo, 23/09/07\u2018Messi\u2019s got guts\u2019 \u2013 El Peri\u00f3dico, 27/09/07\u2018Messi was worth the entrance fee\u2019 \u2013 La Vanguardia, \n30/09/07\n\u2018Messi is king of La Liga\u2019 \u2013 Marca, 08/10/07\u2018Messi\u2019s irresistible rise\u2019 \u2013 Sport, 09/10/07\u2018Messi does the mambo\u2019 \u2013 Mundo Deportivo, 09/10/07\u2018Messi starts to do what Maradona did before him\u2019 \u2013 As, \n18/10/07\nAnd it\u2019s not just the headlines on every page which cele-\nbrate the moment of glory, the divinely inspired play, \u2018the 194 Messi\nbrilliance and inspiration\u2019 of the Argentine \u2018who turns \neverything  he touches to gold\u2019. There is talk of a \u2018footballer without limits\u2019, and it is \nstated that, given his mindset, Messi is capable of \u2018taking risks and directing the game\u2019.\nIn an exclusive interview in Marca, Diego does not argue \nwith any of this; he simply explains that \u2018if Rijkaard puts Messi on the bench, Laporta will throw him out\u2019. And after \nhis team\u2019s harsh defeat at the Nou Camp, Zaragoza coach V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez says what everyone is thinking: \u2018Messi could be the best in the world. \u2018Messi is close behind Kak\u00e1,\u2019 writes La Vanguardia. \u2018Messi is \na candidate for the Ballon d\u2019Or. His performance and goals \nfor Bar\u00e7a and Argentina make him a favourite,\u2019 announces Marca. In the meantime, \nwhile awaiting the verdict, Messi is awarded the Bravo, the Bronze and silver  195\nprize given by Italian sports magazine Guerin Sportivo to the \nbest Under 21 in the European championships. Leo is the \nfirst Argentine and third Barcelona player to win it, after \nGuardiola and Ronaldo. Messi is \nin third place. \nIt\u2019s simple, explains Kak\u00e1, \u2018Messi hasn\u2019t won any important \ntitles this season, not La Liga, nor the Champions League, and I think that has counted against him. The \npresenter announces Messi in second place and Ronaldo in third. Messi but-tons his jacket. Blatter has to motion to him and insist: \u2018Messi, it\u2019s for Messi.\u2019\nLeo Messi shouldn\u2019t even have been there. I was betting on \nRodrigo, who was a good striker. It\u2019s not easy, I have had to learn, 198 Messi\nI have made mistakes, and bit by bit I have straightened out \nany issues along the way.\nWhat do you think of Lionel Messi. In addition, \nfor me Messi has physical thinking.\u2019202 Messi\nWhat does that mean. He has the same \ngift that Pel\u00e9, Maradona and Di St\u00e9fano had. Messi gets an \nidea and, bam. Messi \ncould reach that position, but he still needs time, he needs \nto develop his gifts and prepare himself for the opposition, he needs to reach his footballing maturity.\u2019\nIs Messi already an icon. Being Messi won\u2019t be easy, it will definitely be a \nheadache. It\u2019s a lesson Messi needs to remember when he\u2019s at the top.", "Messi_1993": " These feelings and many more occupy \nMessi\u2019s thoughts and words in the middle of June.) Messi sees nothing wrong with it if it helps them win, but despite the Argentine\u2019s good \nintentions and expectations, the miracle, which seemed 184 Messi\npossible  in the 65th minute, is not forthcoming in the end. Because in fact, on an individual level, \nit has been a positive season for Messi. The goals scored and the \naward for best foreign Liga player are nothing more than a meagre consolation prize. And the \npossibility of being in the starting line-up in an important \ntournament, not simply part of the squad, as happened to him in the Germany World Cup. \nHe calls him up for the European mini-tour, in Berne and Barcelona, where they will face Switzerland and Algeria, \nwith a view to playing him in the continental champion-\nship which will take place in Venezuela, where the whole world is convinced that Messi will play the leading role.\nOn 24 June in Maracaibo, four days before Argentina\u2019s \nopening match against the United States, Messi celebrates his twentieth birthday and the media wheedle out of him an \nobvious wish: \u2018To win the Copa Am\u00e9rica and be the highest \ngoal scorer. The expectations \nplaced on Messi are so high that, in contrast to what hap-\npened in Germany, both the squad and the coach fuss over him. The 32-year-old ex-Boca, Sampdoria, \nParma, Inter, Lazio, Manchester United and Chelsea player, who has had newfound success with his first love, Estudiantes \nde la Plata (an Argentine team), offers advice to the twenty-\nyear-old Messi both on and off the pitch, and defends him against accusations that he is an arrogant soloist. \u2018Messi is \nreserved. And in fact, Messi does need \ntaking care of because Messimania has been unleashed in Venezuela. Messi is walking towards the dressing room tunnel, tired and distracted, when out of the blue he \nsees a girl. \nArgentina have just beaten Peru 4-0, and in the 61st minute Messi has scored that longed-for goal.

Messi \nscores five goals in the group phase: two against Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine, to reclaim a match which had been \nan uphill struggle for the Blaugrana; another two against \nFC Basel: one in Switzerland, which ended up being a Barcelona attack-fest (0-5), and the other at the Nou Camp. The Blaugrana hero \nis Andr\u00e9s Iniesta with his heavenly shot in the 93rd minute, \nbut it was Leo Messi who supplied the ball to the Blaugrana number 8 in the \u2018D\u2019. At long last \u2026 after working day and \nnight, the Bar\u00e7a number 10 has earned the right to be a \nteam leader. \nBarcelona: Vald\u00e9s, Puyol, Tour\u00e9, Piqu\u00e9, Sylvinho, Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Henry, Eto\u2019o.\nThe media is promoting the match as the great duel \nbetween Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi. Cristiano puts his head in his 228 Messi\nhands. Before Messi has touched the ball, the white-shirted \nnumber 7 has given quite a performance: three shots and \na yellow card for Piqu\u00e9, who had tried to stop him with an obstructive foul. Messi is playing as a dummy centre forward to force \nthe Manchester United central defenders out of position \u2013 \nsomething Ferguson would later say \u2018surprised us and made it difficult for us to mark him\u2019. Bar\u00e7a begin to take control of the game and although it is not his \nbest night and he only manages to infiltrate the forest of \nwhite shirts a few times, Messi is getting better and better. Manchester United\u2019s French left back, Patrice Evra \u2013 the \nman who won them the duel with Lionel in April 2008 (0-0 \nin the first leg, 1-0 in the return leg) \u2013 had already predicted it: \u2018Messi is \u201chungrier\u201d and he is a better player now than he \nwas a year ago. With his back to the defenders, Messi goes up for it, \nvery high, and heads the ball in at the opposite post from \nwhere the goalie is.\u2019\nThe photo: Messi suspended in the air, immobile, high, \nvery high, leaning back. At a press conference in Santander \non 1 February 2009, the day before the match against Racing, when asked if Messi needed to score more headers in order \nto become the best player in the world, the coach from \nSantpedor replied: \u2018I advise you not to test him because one day he\u2019ll score an incredible header and shut you all up.\u2019\nThe curiosity: \u2018I didn\u2019t see my son\u2019s goal,\u2019 admits Jorge \nMessi, in the stands with his wife Celia, Leo\u2019s siblings and their respective families.\u2019 Because no sooner has his \nson come back down to earth \u2013 and before being inundated \nwith hugs from his team-mates \u2013 than he does a lap holding 230 Messi\nup his new blue boot, as homage to Argentina. Cristiano Ronaldo. Later, hurt, and already in his suit, he says: \u2018It \nwasn\u2019t a match between Messi and me, but his team was bet-ter than us, and he was too because he scored. This team \ndeserves it after the great work they have put in all year,\u2019 declares Messi. \u2018Messi, king of Europe,\u2019 runs the headline in \nCorriere dello Sport, the Rome sports paper; \u2018SuperMessi,\u2019 says \nthe Gazzetta dello Sport; \u2018Messi and Barcelona on top of the \nworld,\u2019 reads the headline in La Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires.\u2019 \u2018Marvellous Messi is too much for United,\u2019 reads \nthe headline in The Times, which opts for the same photo as \nEl Pa\u00eds. A smiling Messi, pointing his fingers in the air, and a matter-of-fact headline: \u2018Messi is the best\u2019. True, this Bar\u00e7a team, \ntogether with Messi \u2013 who has already scored 21 goals in the championship \u2013 inspire fear. But when asked if he has \nthought about copying Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink\u2019s \nplan (implemented in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals) the Real Madrid manager insists: \u2018I \nhave no anti-Messi plan because taking him out doesn\u2019t \nguarantee anything. We have to try not to let Barcelona 232 Messi\nhave a good day and work hard together as a team. Guardiola\u2019s men \nwaste opportunities: out of selfishness, as is the case with \nMessi, who really wants to score against Madrid (in his pre-vious three trips to the Bernab\u00e9u he has never once scored) \nand who fails to see his unmarked team-mate; or out of too \nmuch generosity, as is the case with Iniesta\u2019s yellow boots, which, after a duet of one-twos all the way up the pitch with \nthe Argentine, do not seal the deal, and give the ball to the \nFlea who shoots at close range \u2013 blocked by Iker. And the goals score themselves: because Xavi, the \u2018doctor\u2019, creates \never more beautiful assists; because Iniesta makes one drib-\nbling run after another; because Henry makes a laughing stock of Ramos and scores his second goal; because Messi is \nlike a spirit who appears on any part of the pitch, wherever \nyou least expect him. It is not the first \ntime that Messi is helping this organisation. It is an example of how a \nball in the back of the net can serve as something more than 234 Messi\njust a football result. Final of the Copa del \nRey: Athletic Bilbao-Barcelona\n\u2018Messi is the king\u2019 proclaims a yellow placard, which is being \nwaved in the curve of the stadium where the Barcelona fans are sitting. No offence intended to Juan Carlos, king of Spain, Happiness  235\nwho is watching the match from the stands, but the Bar\u00e7a \nfans are right. The Bilbaoans have the advan-\ntage, and they proudly resist until the second half when, just at the right moment, Messi appears. Then Messi looks for the pass that allows Eto\u2019o to score \u2013 a reward for his self-denial through-\nout the entire match. And were it not for Gorka, who saves \nit with his foot, the Cameroonian almost would have made 236 Messi\nit. Bar\u00e7a win their 25th Copa del Rey. And \nnext day Marca writes: \u2018Messi hardly ever fails in this type \nof fixture, and yesterday he showed once again that he is \nthe most decisive player of the Spanish Liga.\u2019\n23 August 2009, Nou Camp stadium, Barcelona. Alongside him is the brand-new Blaugrana sign-\ning: Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c, signed in exchange for 45 million \neuros and Samuel Eto\u2019o\u2019s transfer to Inter. Without Leo, Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c and the injured Iniesta, Pep\u2019s team returned \nfrom Bilbao with a 1-2 result (goals from De Marcos, Xavi \nand Pedro) and the Super Cup almost in the bag. Xavi Happiness  237\npasses to Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c, the striker back-heels it to Messi, and \nthe Argentine dodges past the central defender with his left \nfoot, in order to bounce the ball into the goalmouth with his \nright. They had been lack-ing shots on target, but along comes Messi, who kick-starts \nthe party with his incredible goal and finishes it up from the \npenalty spot in the 67th minute. It is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s fourth consecu-\ntive title. He is a 22-year-old Brazilian player, and Barcelona\u2019s number 17. He arrived at Barcelona as a boy of \nfifteen, and is one of eight called upon by Pep Guardiola \nfor the seemingly endless UEFA Super Cup match. Well \u2026 in the 81st \nminute Pedrito comes on for Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c and in the \n115th, after a back-and-forth with Messi, he finds the perfect angle, the gap just by Pyatov\u2019s goalpost, in order to draw a \nline under a gruelling match and win Bar\u00e7a their fifth cup \nof the season. But in reality, and with great humility  , the 238 Messi\nlittle Brazilian recognises that the credit belongs to Messi.\nAnd here goes Leo Messi again, free kick just on the edge \nof the area. It is shot number 21 for Bar\u00e7a, and it is the vic-\ntory shot.\nBut man cannot live on trophies and cups alone \u2026 \nalthough, for Messi, football is very important. Like the Rosario model Macarena 240 Messi\nLemos, before the 2006 World Cup, or eighteen-year-old \nNerina, or the Argentine sex bomb Luciana Salazar. We will wait \u2026 Leo has all he needs in order to keep both them and future generations \ncomfortable: on 18 September 2009, he renews his contract \nwith Barcelona for the fourth year running. After coming third in 2007 and \nsecond in 2008, Lionel Andr\u00e9s Messi wins France Football \nmagazine\u2019s 2009 Ballon d\u2019Or. And he wins it by a mile \u2013 Messi gets 473 out of a possible 480 points, more than \ndouble  the score of Cristiano Ronaldo, the runner-up, who \nis awarded 233 points.54 per cent of the \nmaximum number of points possible, nobody in the 54-year history of this prestigious prize has won it as convincingly \nor unanimously as Messi. Messi\u2019s coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, his dribbling, his acceleration, \nhis efforts to destabilise the opposition, his talent, his \ncreative spirit and his sense of teamwork, along with some of his goals, have made a profound impression throughout the year. His influence within football is still not complete, but what I find marvellous is the fact that the sheer joy and impertinence of his 242 Messi\npresence on the pitch resemble those of a certain \nMaradona. We shouldn\u2019t forget that despite his young age, Messi has been among the contenders for the Ballon d\u2019Or several times. Clearly, modern football will not give its highest honour to a flash in the pan, even one as impressive as Messi. Messi is champion of Europe, of La Liga with Barcelona, winner of the European Super Cup and the Copa del Rey, and with the Argentine side has qualified for the final stages of the World Cup.\nAll sides are united in agreement on Messi\u2019s records, per -\nformances, talent, class and professional career. Describing his reasons for vot-\ning for Messi, the Daily Telegraph journalist Henry Winter \nwrites in France Football:\nMessi.00pm on Monday 30 November 2009 when France \nFootball\u2019s representatives knock on the door of Messi\u2019s cha-\nlet in Castelldefels to deliver the good news. Messi was unable to play in that \nmatch as he had sustained a muscular injury while playing \nAthletic Bilbao at San Mam\u00e9s on the final match day of La Liga, but on Sunday 29 November he is in the starting line-\nup for the classic derby against Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Real \nMadrid. Messi appears very little in the first half; he does not create play and his contribution is \nnot decisive. However, in the second half, after Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c puts Bar\u00e7a ahead with an unstoppable \nleft-footed shot and Busquets gets a red card, the Flea is \nonce again at his best. Alves crosses it into the centre from the right wing \nand Lionel shoots point-blank, which the incredible Casillas 244 Messi\nsaves. It would have been a great pleasure for Messi to score \nhis eighth goal against the Madrid keeper \u2013 his last one was \na penalty in the friendly between Spain and Argentina on 14 November \u2013 but, as he says in his post-match interview, \n\u2018it was not to be, because of Casillas\u2019 great save.\u2019 This \nmay be true, but Lionel has won his showdown with the 2008 winner of the award, Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe next day sees more front pages devoted to Messi, a \nhuge press conference and interviews. \u2018I cannot lie \u2013 I had a feeling that it could happen this year \u2013 but the results of the ballot surprised me,\u2019 says Messi in the Nou Camp press room. I knew him from Bar\u00e7a B  \nbut had never had direct contact with him.\u2019246 Messi\nAnd the boss is not the only one who is full of praise.\nThe best footballer of 2009 is crowned on 6 December \n2009 at 11. But the day before \nthe ceremony, Messi has a match to play against Deportivo \nde La Coru\u00f1a, in the Riazor stadium. The \nspectators in the old Galician stadium shout \u2018Messi, Messi, \nMessi. Messi parades \nround the city, wearing a suit, tie and make-up, and stops in front of the Eiffel Tower before going into the television \nstudio, where he is greeted by his former Bar\u00e7a team-mate Lilian Thuram. They have been pounding on Messi continually. It is the Flea who steps up to the \nball: majestic execution, left-footed shot hammered into 248 Messi\nthe back of the net.\u2019\nThe medical report states that Messi is suffering from a \ngrade one sprain of his right ankle.\nThe photos and the TV footage from the United Arab \nEmirates show Messi on the beach, in blue swimming trunks and with a bandaged ankle, training in order to recover in good time. In the 35th minute Sergio Busquets equalises. There is nothing to do but call on Messi. But Bar\u00e7a have stalled, and \nGuardiola makes use of him in the 53rd minute. \u2018I knew that Messi was coming on judging by the screams from the \ncrowd. It is his first touch, and it is 1-2; the Mexican resistance is over; Bar\u00e7a has woken up; Pedro nets the third, becoming \nthe only footballer in history to have scored in six different \nclub competitions in one season; now the eleven Blaugrana players can dedicate themselves to delighting the crowd \nwith kicks and touches. The chances come \none after the other and Messi allows himself the luxury of missing another head-to-head with Vilar, the Argentine \ngoalie, whom he knows well from the Albiceleste. And, once \nagain, Messi has been the genie. Jos\u00e9 Cruz explains it as follows: \u2018Without Messi Barcelona is the best team in the \nworld; when Leo plays they are from another galaxy. 250 Messi\nThey are the team of the bald \u2018Brujita\u2019 (\u2018little witch\u2019), Juan \nSebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, who was Leo\u2019s mentor in the 2007 Copa \nAm\u00e9rica, the globe-trotter who has become the team\u2019s cen-tral figure and dreams of repeating the achievements of his \nfather Juan Ram\u00f3n \u2018La Bruja\u2019 (\u2018the witch\u2019) Ver\u00f3n. Bar\u00e7a find themselves in the worst pos-\nsible scenario: a goal down, no goals of their own, Messi with a yellow card to his name and, above all, a team that \nis lost and can find neither gaps in midfield, nor decisive \npasses. Messi is invis-\nible and Henry is nowhere to be found; Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c battles \non with little effect. And Bar\u00e7a have won, the Argentines know it. After the 1992 and 2006 defeats, Bar\u00e7a win the trophy for the first time in the \nclub\u2019s 110-year history. \u2018Right now I don\u2019t think we have fully realised what we have \nachieved,\u2019 confesses Messi to El Peri\u00f3dico.00pm, UEFA president Michel \nPlatini steps up to the podium accompanied by FIFA 252 Messi\npresident  Joseph \u2018Sepp\u2019 Blatter. Then comes the most important moment, the announcement: \u2018The FIFA World Player 2009 \nis Lionel Messi. The Bar\u00e7a number 10 gets up from his seat, buttons his Ermenegildo Zegna jacket, adjusts \nhis blue tie and goes up on stage. He \nhas won, and he has done it by a landslide once again: 1,073 \npoints, three times as many as Cristiano Ronaldo, who is \nsecond with 352, Xavi is third (196), Kak\u00e1 fourth (190) and Iniesta fifth (134).\n\u2018This is priceless, it\u2019s priceless,\u2019 declares Jorge Messi, who \nis accompanied by Celia, Mat\u00edas, Rodrigo and Mar\u00eda Sol. \n\u2018Because in the Barcelona shirt he is transformed, and in \nthe Argentine one he is not. Maradona has imposed a Messianic \nmodel,\u2019 writes David Gistau in El Mundo, \u2018in which Messi, the child of another time, does not fit; furthermore, he left Argentina very quickly \u2013 as if immersing himself in a kind of \npopular idolatry.\u2019 They do not realise that the problem does \nnot lie with Messi, but rather with the team. They see him as a foreigner, they write \u2018Messi is not Argentine\u2019, because he \nhas given all he can to Bar\u00e7a, he has given it his all in Europe \nand, what\u2019s more, he has ruined Estudiantes\u2019 dream, which was supported by practically the whole country. Yes, Messi \nhas a problem with Argentines, or better, the Argentines \nhave a problem with Messi.", "Messi_1986": " From the opponent\u2019s half, Messi keeps running.\n\u2018It was very hard to see Messi in such a state in the dress-\ning room,\u2019 explains Signorini.\u2019256 Messi\nThat\u2019s how Messi\u2019s World Cup ends, with tears of frustra-\ntion, pain and a sense of powerlessness. \nHe has failed to live up to the hopes of the Argentine \nfans \u2013 the dream that he would rival Maradona\u2019s achieve-\nments in the 1986 Mexico World Cup. Messi \nthe Ballon d\u2019Or winner. Messi, Barcelona\u2019s brightest star. He has left \nthe strikers in the Spanish, English, German and Italian \nleagues in the dust. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn has 27, Didier Drogba 29, Arjen Robben 23, and Antonio Di Natale has scored 29.\nIn La Liga, Messi has played better than anyone else \nand better than ever \u2013 he has beaten all his previous scores since he joined the first team six years ago. He is the top scorer, with nine double goals and four hat-tricks. And with \n34 league goals he has equalled Ronaldo\u2019s 1996\u201397 figure. \nHe has also broken a record at Bar\u00e7a HQ: he is the young-est player in the Catalan club\u2019s history to score more than \n100 league goals, and he has outstripped strikers such as \nRivaldo, Romario and Eto\u2019o. \nBar\u00e7a takes the title on the final match day of the season thanks to a definitive whitewash \u2013 4-0 against Valladolid with two from Messi. And Lionel has surpassed \nCristiano Ronaldo, the 2008 Ballon d\u2019Or, the most expen-\nsive player in footballing history and star of Florentino\u2019s team. Messi is distraught. Following on from a fantastic defensive effort and a perfect game in Milan, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Inter succeed \nin knocking Bar\u00e7a out of the Champions League. The 258 Messi\nEuropean champions are out in the semi-final and they \nwon\u2019t be going to the much coveted final at the Bernab\u00e9u. The same Messi who had scored four goals against Wenger\u2019s Arsenal \nhas not managed a single goal against any team managed \nby Mourinho \u2013 Chelsea or Inter.\nIn Argentina, Lionel scores points in the eternal com-\nparison with Maradona, despite the fact that many of his compatriots\u2019 hearts still beat for Diego. If Messi could \nbe explosive for Argentina and lift the cup the fans have \nbeen dreaming about since 1986, then perhaps he would escape the Pelusa\u2019s shadow once and for all. Maradona-\nMessi, Messi-Maradona \u2026 the relationship appears to have \nfound stability after all the back and forth, all the criticism and contradictory statements, and all the references to the \nOedipus complex.\nSince Diego\u2019s arrival in the Albiceleste dugout, Lionel \nhas played eleven games and has only scored three goals. His worst moment with the team is on 14 October 2009, \nwhen he is accused of not celebrating Mario Bolatti\u2019s goal 260 Messi\nagainst Uruguay which seals Argentina\u2019s place in South \nAfrica. And he\u2019s Argentine. And that we \nneed Messi to play the way he does at Bar\u00e7a. Messi knows that his team-mates want him to be the cherry on the cake. When we\u2019re playing, they can\u2019t pass it to me anymore \u2026 so if they don\u2019t pass it to \nMessi, then we\u2019re getting it wrong. \u2018Messi has a lot more support \nthan I had before the Mexico World Cup in 1986,\u2019 explains Maradona.\u2019\nAt the start of the training camp, he tells the group lead-\ners to \u2018make Messi feel like the best\u2019. At the pre-match press conference, Maradona gifts the media the following \nday\u2019s headline: \u2018Argentina is still a Rolls-Royce \u2013 but now it\u2019s \ndriven by Messi. He is the best in Argentina. He creates the most chances in front of \ngoal (wasted by T\u00e9vez and Higua\u00edn), he is the most enthu-\nsiastic, and he takes the most shots at goal \u2013 eight.\n\u2018I have to thank God and Messi for this trophy, because \nmy saves were the work of God,\u2019 Enyeama says afterwards. 262 Messi\n\u2018I believe in God and despite studying Messi\u2019s Liga goals \nextensively, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything with-\nout God\u2019s help.\u2019\nAt the end of the match, won by a header from Gabriel \nHeinze, Maradona rushes over to Messi and lifts him up in his arms. The Pelusa is the only manager in World Cup history to kiss his players \nafter every game and every substitution, but his two kisses to \nMessi are a tribute, in recognition of what he has done for the whole team.\n\u2018Messi was on the ball all day. The Argentine and Spanish press are unani-mous: Lionel has played better than the rest of the team and he has led his team to victory \u2013 a victory which should \nhave been greater. But at \nleast they are through to the second round thanks to the victory \u2013 and Messi.\u2019\nThe press ask him about the possible \u2018Messidependence\u2019 \nof the Argentine team. Maradona posi-\ntions him in front of Mascherano, the sweeper in midfield, \nand behind the battalion: Maxi, T\u00e9vez, Higua\u00edn and di Mar\u00eda. He has a hand in each of Argentina\u2019s 264 Messi\nfour goals.\nAccording to Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Messi is becom-\ning \u2018another Xavi\u2019. The \none who is most sure is Maradona. Messi is overjoyed. The number 19 has stuck to Messi like glue the entire game. To everyone who complained that Messi wasn\u2019t singing along \nand that he looked sad \u2013 who likes to lose. Now everything has turned around and making Messi happy is something everyone is proud to do. Messi loses his bet with Maradona \u2013 he doesn\u2019t score a single goal. Argentina beat Javier Aguirre\u2019s \nmen 3-1 with minimal effort, after T\u00e9vez opens with a goal which looks offside. \u2018I thought they were going to disallow \nit because they were looking at the replay, but luckily they \nruled it as a goal,\u2019 says Messi, who set up the pass which the \u2018Apache\u2019 T\u00e9vez headed into the net. He is obliged to keep going back to the centre circle to 266 Messi\nget into the game. The Argentine newspaper calls for changes in the midfield to \nfree up Messi so that he doesn\u2019t have to run so far from the \ngoal, because they certainly can\u2019t bench the best player in the world. The 3-2 win in the final of the 1986 Mexico World Cup, Maradona\u2019s \ntears after losing the 1990 final in Italy, and the defeat on \npenalties in the quarter finals in 2006.\nMaradona\u2019s tactical gamble, which had been hailed as \nrevolutionary, fails Messi again and again, just when it mat-ters most.\nHis World Cup score sheet is dismal. Or was it the position behind the strik-\ners that Maradona created which left Messi too far from the \nbox. The worst \ntour since 1974\u2019 \u2013 Clar\u00edn\u2018Germany crushes Argentina\u2019 \u2013 La Naci\u00f3n\u2018No goals or glory for Messi\u2019 \u2013 Ol\u00e9\u2018Tears for Messi and Argentina\u2019 \u2013 Perfil\nAfter the match, Maradona calls it \u2018the hardest moment in \nmy life, a real blow\u2019. But Messi says nothing, he can only \nshed tears.\u2019\nWhen Bar\u00e7a team-mate Andr\u00e9s Iniesta scores the goal \nwhich clinches Spain\u2019s first World Cup victory, Lionel is far \naway from South Africa. When it rolls \naround Lionel will be 26, the same age Maradona was in 1986 when he became king.", "Messi_2010": "269Chapter 38\nSurprise\n10 January 2011\nPep Guardiola\u2019s face is an open book. A moment of confusion ensues 270 Messi\nwhile the gaffer turns it over, before finally announcing: \n\u2018Lionel Messi\u2019.\nDespite all bets being on Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi \nHern\u00e1ndez as the favourites, Messi has won the 2010 FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or.\n\u2018Messi deserves it. The kid from Rosario has been perfectly calm at \nthe gala during the lead-up to the announcement, much \nmore so than he was at the same venue in 2009 when he 272 Messi\ncollected FIFA World Player of the Year. Unlike Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho who knew beforehand that he had beaten Spain\u2019s \nmanager Vicente del Bosque as well as Pep Guardiola to the best manager prize, Messi has no idea that he will be win-\nning his second Ballon d\u2019Or. Which is why, when he comes onto the Palace of Congress stage as a member of the \n\u2018best eleven of 2010\u2019 (Casillas, Puyol, Piqu\u00e9, Lucio, Maicon, \nIniesta, Xavi, Sneijder, Cristiano Ronaldo, Villa, Messi), he looks relaxed and nowhere near as nervous as he has on \nprevious occasions.\u2019\nSurprises aside, it seems that none of the other candi-\ndates or winners objects to Messi\u2019s prize. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, for example, explains: \u2018For me, Messi, Iniesta and Xavi are play-ers on another level. And when a player on another level \nsuch as Messi wins, everyone should respect it. It was very difficult to choose the best and I think that Mourinho deserves it just as much as Leo Messi. It\u2019s gold for Messi and disappointment \nfor Spain,\u2019 reads the As headline.\u2019 It later adds: \u2018Messi \nwithout Xavi and Iniesta is a lot less Messi.\u2019\n\u2018Two giants [Messi and Mourinho] and a Spanish boy-\ncott,\u2019 complains the cover of Marca. He denied us the 2018 World Cup in December, and now \nhe has left Xavi, Iniesta and del Bosque trophy-less.\u2019 Marca \nhas also launched a poll on its website: \u2018Was it fair for Messi to win the Ballon d\u2019Or.274 Messi\nBut it is not just the online voters and the Madrid sports \nmedia who are disappointed with FIFA. Messi has triumphed when he has played with Xavi and Iniesta, but he couldn\u2019t do it \nwithout them in Africa. The two of them, Xavi as much as Iniesta, don\u2019t just symbolise an attractive ideology \nabout the game the way that Messi does. Maybe questions need to be asked \nabout why Spain loses all the global sporting votes: the 2016 \nOlympics, the 2018 World Cup, the 2010 Ballon d\u2019Or \u2026 It\u2019s a well deserved prize for Messi but it\u2019s an undeserved indif-\nference towards Spanish football, a day Barcelona will not \nforget. And almost nobody agrees with the choice of Messi as winner. \u2018Messi. Turin Surprise  275\nnewspaper La Stampa writes that \u2018football has lost its way\u2019, \nsince \u2018Messi has not won any titles of late\u2019. Messi\u2019s 58 goals \nin the last season which helped Bar\u00e7a win their second con-\nsecutive Liga title and the Supercup against Seville seem to \ncount for very little, as does the Argentine\u2019s brilliant start to \nthe season (28 goals in 26 matches). How could \nDiego Milito, a key player in Inter Milan\u2019s Italian league win and Champions League win, not have made the list. (Later it transpires that if it hadn\u2019t been for the journalists\u2019 votes, Sneijder would \nhave been the winner, with Messi in fourth place. \u2018The undisputed number \none doesn\u2019t need a World Cup in order to win the prize,\u2019 276 Messi\ninsists Mundo Deportivo. \u2018Gold for Messi, glory for Bar\u00e7a,\u2019 \nreads the headline in Sport, emphasising that more than any \nindividual player, there is one clear winner: Barcelona. The \nonly dissenting opinion comes from weekly sports magazine \nDon Bal\u00f3n, which writes in its editorial: \u2018Few people doubt \nthat Messi is number one, but in 2010, Xavi \u2013 if Iniesta will excuse me \u2013 deserved to be recognised as the chosen one. \u2018Messi is the best once again,\u2019 says Clar\u00edn. \u2018The world worships Messi,\u2019 writes La Naci\u00f3n. \u2018Messi \nis pure gold,\u2019 claims P\u00e1gina 12. I \nwouldn\u2019t have been able to bear it if Messi hadn\u2019t won. \u2018Xavi always looks like he\u2019s in con-\ntrol, he plays with authority, but it\u2019s Messi who scores the \ngoals. Yes, Iniesta scored in the World Cup final, he\u2019s a great player, fantastic, talented. But \nout of those three, I would choose Messi ten times over.\u2019 \nAnd when asked about the Spaniards\u2019 annoyance regard-ing Messi\u2019s triumph, the Pelusa replies: \u2018They might be \nthe champions of the world, but we have the best player in  \nthe world. \u2018How \ncan anyone say they\u2019ve been robbed by Messi. Messi  \ngives us so much,\u2019 declares the Barcelona manager. He makes La Liga better and more respected.\u2019\nDespite having two such heavyweight advocates in his \ncorner, Messi still has to speak out and explain to one and all that he has no reason to justify himself because has not \n\u2018robbed\u2019 anyone of anything, and he has done enough to \nmerit lifting the trophy.\u2019278 Messi\nRegarding his team-mates, he says: \u2018There is no jealousy \nbetween us. Messi lifts the Ballon d\u2019Or, waves to the crowd and \nposes for photographs while the coaches and staff give him a standing ovation.\nEighty-five minutes later, the sound of \u2018Messi. Messi. \nMessi. The only thing left to say is that Messi \nis simply the best.\nAbove all, Messi has been a team player. He demonstrates 280 Messi\nhis wide repertoire: quick runs, passes in from the touchline \nto get round the opponents, assists, and attempts at goal. \u2018To be honest, we\u2019ve never been \nable to keep Messi completely in check, so we had fair warn-\ning,\u2019 concedes the Red Devils\u2019 manager Sir Alex Ferguson at the post-match press conference. And nobody \ncan do that better than Messi. \u2018I got some space, the goalie came out and luckily it \nwent in,\u2019 says Messi later. It is not the most stunning goal the number 10 has ever scored for Bar\u00e7a, but he celebrates like \nnever before. This is the one that puts Bar\u00e7a ahead just when \nthey need it the most.\nHe has scored 53 goals in 54 games this season (31 in La \nLiga, twelve in the Champions League, seven in the Copa del Rey and three in the Spanish Supercup). He is level with \nCristiano Ronaldo, who has claimed the title of top Liga \nscorer with 40 goals \u2013 a title which doesn\u2019t seem to matter much to the Flea.\nIn the Champions League, he is in the lead: twelve goals, \nequalling Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record. \nFor the third consecutive year, Messi is the top Champions League goal-scorer.\nHe has scored a total of 39 goals in his 59 Champions \nLeague matches, a fantastic achievement.\nTwenty-three years of age, top Champions League scorer \nfor the third time, not to mention winner of fourteen other titles. But statistics and trophies aside, it is worth noting that \nwhen it matters most, Messi is there when needed, he is always a game-changer and he always plays to the best of his abilities. We have demonstrated that we are \ncapable of working very hard, we have talent, and we have \nMessi. He is a unique and irreplaceable footballer.\u2019\nNo, Messi has never failed and he has never been bored, \nnot even for a single minute at Wembley or during the entire 2010\u201311 season. Because, they \nsay, Cristiano is better than Messi, because \u00d6zil is a gen-\nius, because di Mar\u00eda and Benzema are the two best strik-ers. Because Mourinho is not Manuel Pellegrini, nor is he \nBernd Schuster or Juande Ramos or even Fabio Capello. He leaves \nBarcelona without having notched up a single goal in the six games he has played against them.\nMessi hasn\u2019t scored either, breaking a run of ten consec-\nutive games in which he has scored, but he has been gener -\nous and helped set up goals three and four for David Villa \nwith surgical precision. On the pitch, that role belongs to \nMessi. He is the highest scoring Bar\u00e7a player in a single season, beat-\ning Ronaldo Nazario\u2019s 1996\u201397 record when Bobby Robson \nwas the coach. And he is ahead of rival Cristiano Ronaldo 286 Messi\nby thirteen goals. \u2018Messi gives us so much \nmore than goals,\u2019 maintains V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. But he has never scored against a team led by Mourinho and this will be his ninth game against him. Despite having been ahead and having the extra man, Bar\u00e7a strug-gle and don\u2019t know how to seal the game. This time it\u2019s Leo Messi in the spot-light, for kicking a ball into the stands.288 Messi\nAnd where was Messi. \u2018Since Mr Mourinho has \naddressed me in such familiar terms and called me \u201cPep\u201d, \nI\u2019ll call him \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d,\u2019 he begins. Let him have the Champions League.\u2019\nThe next day, Lionel Messi is the master on the pitch, \nbut at the press conference it\u2019s Mourinho once again. Right from the \nstart, the Whites move to block Messi\u2019s game, but they don\u2019t \nmake any attempt to play their own.\nAt the other end, Messi is playing as deep as midfield, \nbeing kept far away from the box where he can do the most damage. Messi gets there first, beating Sergio Ramos to \nthe ball. This time it\u2019s magnificent: he leaves the centre circle, passes to Busquets \nwho passes it back, he sets off on a slalom leaving Ramos \nbehind and breaking free from Albiol, changes direction, 290 Messi\ngets into the box, dodges past Marcelo and before Ramos \ncan catch him he finishes it off in spectacular style. Messi finally comes face to face with Casillas, who miraculously manages to block three attempts in five minutes, \nto keep his team out of danger. Messi doesn\u2019t manage to score this time, but he is running all over the shop and keeping up the pressure.\u2019292 Messi\nAmid all the chaos, Messi is happy to be carried along by \nthe atmosphere at the Nou Camp. \nMessi is laughing as he hugs the cup, holding up three fingers  for three European trophies.", "Messi_2008": "293Chapter 40\nBarcelona\nConversation with Leo Messi\nTwenty-four years are very few.

The Club Atl\u00e9tico Rosario Central was founded \non 24 December 1889 as the Central Argentine Railway Athletic Club. Later, with the merging of the Ferrocarril \nCentral Argentino and the Buenos Aires Railway companies in 1903, the club\u2019s name changed.

It was 1993 and the \u2018Golden Boy\u2019 was back from Europe, where \nhe had begun in Barcelona, moved to Napoli and ended \nup finally at Sevilla. 32 Messi\nThe match was to be played between Rosario\u2019s two biggest \nteams, so the authorities of both clubs were approached for their approval in order for the match to go ahead. Even though this has become the most widespread version of the story over the years, and perhaps is the only true ver -\nsion of the facts, it is worth pointing out that some of the older Rosario generation recount a different explanation of why, according to them, the Newell\u2019s fans were always known as the lepers, even before the founding of the club in the early twentieth century, when it was no more than a Rosario educational establishment.\nIt is a nickname that will also be associated with Lionel when \nRosario\u2019s La Capital newspaper interviews him for the first \ntime. Above the railings is the banner: \u2018Escuela de \nF\u00fatbol Malvinas Newell\u2019s Old Boys\u2019. The boys lost the title, but they learned from their mistakes, \ngiven that in the following four seasons they suffered one 34 Messi\ndefeat, this time at the hands of their training mates, the \nNewell\u2019s C team. Thanks to that unstoppable run, the team \nended up earning the club the glorious name la M\u00e1quina del \u201987 \u2013 the \u201987 Machine. More than 25 teams from Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and \nColombia participated. Like the Balcarce tournament, for example, where the Newell\u2019s \u201987 Red and black  35\nteam knocked out teams like Boca, Independiente and \nSan Lorenzo. Billy, an attacking midfielder from the \u201986 team with \nextraordinary technical abilities, is also from Rosario but \nwas born in a shanty town.", "Club_Atl\u00e9tico_Newell_1994": "29Chapter 5\nRed and black\n21 March 1994\nRa\u00fal: \u2018I\u2019ve always been surrounded by good Argentines \nlike Valdano, who gave me my debut at Real Madrid, or \nRedondo, or the team-mates with whom I have shared a \ndressing room.\u2019\n\u2018Or Newell\u2019s,\u2019 adds Lionel Messi in a low voice.

The students at his school \n\u2013 among them his son Claudio, the club\u2019s promoter \u2013 began \nto play ball and created the club.

And it should also be noted that in \nArgentina, Maradona is not just a footballer, but a people \u2019s 164 Messi\nhero, a living legend, a faith (the Maradonian Church paro-\ndies religion and worships Diego as a supreme god), and a \nnational historic icon, like Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (the general who fought for independence from Spain), Carlos Gardel \n(the famous tango singer), Evita, Jorge Luis Borges (the \nfamous author) or Ernesto \u2018Che\u2019 Guevara. As well as the debate over which goal is better, another question \narises: that of Messi\u2019s intentions, or in other words, to quote La Naci\u00f3n, \u2018Was Messi trying to imitate Maradona.\u2019\nThat air of simplicity, as if it was something normal \n(and deep down it is, it is part of his job), is reminiscent of Maradona in \u201986, or at least it is if we go by the memories \nof Jorge Valdano. Valdano \noffered Maradona the chance to pass; in Messi\u2019s case it was Eto\u2019o. \u2018They say that the England players didn\u2019t try to foul Maradona. In the Mexico World Cup it was H\u00e9ctor Enrique who laid claim to his contribution to the goal and the pre-\nvious pass; here, Xavi does the same.\u2019166 Messi\nDiego Armando Maradona is in hospital. Luckily it is not the case, and during the beginning of May Maradona is discharged from the Avril neuropsychi-\natric clinic where he had voluntarily submitted to therapy \nto help overcome his alcohol dependence. Let\u2019s hear from Maradona: \u2018Those \nwho made that comparison were exaggerating. To start with, my goal was more beautiful \nthan Messi\u2019s. Leo scored his against Getafe, in the Copa \ndel Rey in Spain.\u2019 Maradona restores his \ngoal\u2019s reputation and accuses everyone who has dared to make comparisons as having exaggerated. Months later, in \nan interview with El Gr\u00e1fico, a weekly Buenos Aires sports \npaper, he is even harsher.\u2019\nAnd for those who are still in any doubt, here\u2019s Michael \nRobinson\u2019s commentary from Digital +: \u2018He has scored two \nMaradona-style goals in the same season. On 22 June 1986, Maradona anticipated Peter Shilton, 15cm taller than he was, coming off his line. Despite the technol-\nogy available in 2007 and to the Espanyol players\u2019 despair, Rodr\u00edguez Santiago also allows the goal. Maradona is reluc-\ntant to admit what everyone already knows, \u2018that the Hand \nof God was the hand of Diego.\nDiego and Lionel, Messi and Maradona, the disciple \nand the master. Ariel \u2018the Tiger\u2019 Z\u00e1rate, a 29-year-old from Entre R\u00edos, who performs in a group of four Argentine \nmusicians, has dedicated a song to the subject, called \u2018El Pie de Oro lleg\u00f3\u2019 (\u2018The Golden Foot has arrived\u2019 \u2013 a play on \nMaradona\u2019s nickname \u2018El Pibe de Oro\u2019, meaning Golden \nBoy). It goes like this:\nOn 24 June in \u201987\nA year after Argentina became championsA star was born, a new dreamThe Golden Foot was born in Rosario.\nWith a magical dodge, a great, little player\nAt seven in the juniors for Newell\u2019s Old BoysOver here they turned their back on his problemAnd he had to emigrate and go to Spain,He made his second home in BarcelonaAnd he made it, thanks to sacrifices and love.\nIn 2004 he debuted with Bar\u00e7a\nAnd his dream was realised with the Under 20s(The Golden Foot has arrived.\nNow Messi has his own songwriter, just as Maradona had El \nPotro Rodrigo. Lionel has always been compared to Maradona in one \nform or another. \u2018I have seen him do stunning things with the \nball, which not even Maradona could do at that age,\u2019 insists \nVecchio. \u2018Messi is the closest I \nhave seen to Diego.\u2019\nSince then there have been many who have talked about \nit, in every stage of the Bar\u00e7a number 19\u2019s career. River Plate ex-number 10 Norberto Alonso says, for example: \u2018There \nare things about him which remind me of Maradona. \u2018Messi is \nlike Maradona but with a turbo attached to his feet.\u2019 Nor do footballers past and present, like Eto\u2019o: \u2018Messi is the Diego Armando Maradona of the future\u2019, or Deco: \u2018He \nreminds me a lot of Maradona.\u2019 And Franz Beckenbauer: \u2018When we see him run with the ball we are reminded of \nDiego Maradona at his best, with good reason. \u2018Between Messi and Maradona,\u2019 maintains H\u00e9ctor \n\u2018El Negro\u2019 Enrique, \u201986 World Champion with Argentina, \n\u2018there are two things they have in common: their running style and their speed. The bad thing is not \nthat he\u2019s compared to Maradona, but that Leo believes he is Maradona. Leo and Diego  171\nThe ex-Fiorentina striker and highest-ever goal scorer for \nArgentina says: \u2018Leo shouldn\u2019t try to imitate Maradona, he \nonly has to be himself and do the best he can. Because oth-\nerwise, even if he reaches Diego\u2019s level, he will only be seen as the second Maradona.\u2019 The discordant voices are few in \nnumber, one of them being Pel\u00e9, although it is fairly natural \nbearing in mind the issue relates to Maradona. Maradona used to come from behind. \u2018He is not the new Maradona. Messi is a very good player, left-footed, skilled, powerful, he plays for \nBarcelona and he\u2019s Argentine. But he is not Maradona, he \nis Messi.\u2019 Writer, journalist and psychologist Walter Vargas is categorical, maintaining in his book, Football Delivery: \u2018Messi \nis not and never will be Maradona. \nThey show that Messi and Maradona share a series of physi-\ncal traits: low centre of gravity, muscle mass, height, weight, development and, of course, they are both left-footed. He has seen 172 Messi\nMaradona play and he won\u2019t hear of any comparisons. He \nlists Messi\u2019s weaknesses, from his taking of free kicks to his \nvision of the game, and he glorifies Maradona\u2019s gifts, asking his inquirer if he remembers the number 10\u2019s first goals \nwith the Argentinos Juniors. Let\u2019s move on to Luis, who \nhas a photo of Maradona in action in his completely bostero \n(Boca fan) shop, with the inscription, \u2018Your children and \nyour children\u2019s children will ask about him. Juli\u00e1n, aged ten, the most \nchatty of them all, says emphatically: \u2018I\u2019m a Boca fan, but I like Messi, I like the way he plays. \u2018The old folks who maintain that Messi will never reach the \nlevel of Maradona forget what everyone always says when a \nnew superstar appears: he\u2019ll never make it. They said that Maradona was chubby, too small and that he would never \nbecome a champion at the level of the greats. The great \ngoalie Hugo Gatti was one of the ones who talked inces-santly about how round Maradona was, and Diego scored \nfour goals against him. It\u2019s simple: ever since Maradona retired in 1997, the Argentines \u2013 and oth-\ners too \u2013 are always in search of a successor. And \nwho makes us think back to old times \u2013 because memory is a fundamental aspect of football; because in order for \na young player to sell, it is easier to hang a tag around his \nneck saying \u2018New Pel\u00e9\u2019 or \u2018New Maradona\u2019. As was the case, just in terms of \u2018New Maradonas\u2019, with Ariel Ortega, \nPablo Aimar, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme, or the \u2018Apache\u2019 T\u00e9vez. Even more so when there are so many coincidences, as there are in Messi\u2019s case: little; \nleft-footed; grew up at Newell\u2019s, where Maradona spent a \nbrief stint; matured at Barcelona, the first European club to experience \u2018Maramondo\u2019; Under 20 world champion, like \nMaradona in 1979. And it is even more difficult when Maradona himself invites you onto his TV \nprogramme, La Noche del 10 (Number 10 Night) and singles \nyou out as his heir. Many think that he already is, but in my opinion,\u2019 \nsays Maradona, \u2018he has hardly begun playing.", "Maradona_2003": "\nYou played impassioned games with Milan against the Napoli of \nMaradona, and you were Messi\u2019s coach for five years.\u2019\n\u2018I have many memories of Maradona \u2013 those clashes with Napoli, in the Italian championship, they were historic; but \nwhen Diego played in Italy at 26, 27 years of age, he was \nalready made.

Messi is not in the starting line-up, he is on the bench and the Albiceleste lose 1-0. Videotape  89\nBut Messi makes his mark. Messi is suffering from an absence of players able to pass to him; nonetheless, in the twelfth minute of the second half \nhe manages to level the score, making up for the first goal \nscored by the \u2018coffee-growers\u2019. \nSpeaking of duels, there are great expectations about see-\ning Messi and Cesc go head to head, two eighteen-year-olds (Leo\u2019s birthday was the day before the match), friends from \nBarcelona and rivals on the pitch.\n\u2018I\u2019ve got on well with Messi ever since the first day we met \nin the youth academy.\n\u2018Cesc is a good friend of mine \u2013 we met back in the Bar\u00e7a \nyouth leagues. He\u2019s an impressive, well-rounded player, with many attacking and defensive skills,\u2019 replies Messi. Then Spain \nloses concentration and Leo ups the pace: first he serves up \nthe advantage goal on a silver platter to Gustavo Oberman, 90 Messi\nthen two minutes later, after chipping the ball over the head \nof one of his opponents, he scores the 3-1 winner. The previous day, a Dutch TV \nchannel had presented Messi with a golden clog, the trophy \nthat declares him player of the tournament. In the 38th minute, Messi controls the ball down the left-hand touch-\nline; he begins a 45-yard zigzagging run and gets into the \nbox.

The standard prediction is that the ball will be controlled by the Blaugrana, the favourites, spread across the pitch in a daring 3-4-3 formation, so that Madrid are even less 148 Messi\nmarked than usual. Leo Messi comes on after just five minutes. Leo Messi is proving a nightmare \nagain, as he latches onto a rebound from Casillas. No, along comes Messi to save Bar\u00e7a and keep Madrid at arm\u2019s length.\nLuca Caioli, Corriere della Sera, 11 March 2007\nYes, Capello \u2026 at best he had forgotten what Messi was \ncapable of doing. 2-0 to the Whites \nand everyone at home happy, with a Messi who had put \nin a good effort for at least 70 minutes, with a repertoire of left-footers, assists that were wasted by his team-mates, 150 Messi\nand breakthroughs into the box. Has Messi got something \nagainst Don Fabio, who is currently the England manager. In the 26th minute, Messi\u2019s spectacular \nchange of pace traps Roberto Carlos. In the 47th minute Messi \ntries again. In the 55th minute Casillas denies Messi\u2019s third shot. In the 69th \nminute, Messi is replaced by Iniesta. Against Real Madrid, Bar\u00e7a have to \nlose the player who made all the difference at the start of the season.\nPause for a question: Why does Messi endure so many \ntears and breaks, to the point where people are already call-ing him \u2018the porcelain star\u2019. In Messi\u2019s case, \nsome people also factor in his physical particulars, his mus-\ncular and bone structure and his growth problems, stimu-lated by hormones. After the third goal Messi runs along and repeats the gesture, because \u2018I owe a lot to \nBar\u00e7a for what they did for me when they had the chance, \nand also to the fans for all the affection they have shown towards me, especially in these difficult few months.

There is talk of a \u2018footballer without limits\u2019, and it is \nstated that, given his mindset, Messi is capable of \u2018taking risks and directing the game\u2019. And after \nhis team\u2019s harsh defeat at the Nou Camp, Zaragoza coach V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez says what everyone is thinking: \u2018Messi could be the best in the world. \u2018Messi is \na candidate for the Ballon d\u2019Or. His performance and goals \nfor Bar\u00e7a and Argentina make him a favourite,\u2019 announces Marca. In the meantime, \nwhile awaiting the verdict, Messi is awarded the Bravo, the Bronze and silver  195\nprize given by Italian sports magazine Guerin Sportivo to the \nbest Under 21 in the European championships. Leo is the \nfirst Argentine and third Barcelona player to win it, after \nGuardiola and Ronaldo. Messi is \nin third place. \nIt\u2019s simple, explains Kak\u00e1, \u2018Messi hasn\u2019t won any important \ntitles this season, not La Liga, nor the Champions League, and I think that has counted against him. The \npresenter announces Messi in second place and Ronaldo in third. Messi but-tons his jacket. FIFA \npresident Joseph Blatter and Pel\u00e9 do the honours on the 196 Messi\nZurich Opera House stage. Blatter has to motion to him and insist: \u2018Messi, it\u2019s for Messi.\n\u2018Blatter said that that one was for me; then, when I \nwent to pick it up, it turned out that the other one was for \nCristiano and this one was for me,\u2019 Leo comments at a press \nconference later.\u2019\nLeo Messi shouldn\u2019t even have been there. Jorge \nand Rodrigo go along to keep Leo company. \u2018Just the fact that he is second and third in the world at \ntwenty years of age, means Leo is already a footballing icon. It\u2019s not easy, I have had to learn, 198 Messi\nI have made mistakes, and bit by bit I have straightened out \nany issues along the way. \u2018I was \nby Leo\u2019s side during the first few years here, in Barcelona.", "Leo_Messi_2005": " The adverts are promoting \nit as a challenge between two extremely young Bar\u00e7a stars 206 Messi\n\u2013 Lionel Messi on the one hand, and Bojan Krki\u00b4 c on the \nother. Messi speaks openly. Who is paying him, Bar\u00e7a or Argentina.\u2019 And they dredge up the topic of the possible 8-million-euros-a-\nseason \u2018megacontract\u2019, which Messi is to sign. And there\u2019s \nmore: \u2018Messi is the player around whom the Blaugrana want to reconstruct a winning team, and he says \u201cciao\u201d and he \ngoes off to China. \u2018In Messi\u2019s case, it is not possible for Bar\u00e7a to refuse \nbecause he is under 23 years old,\u2019 writes Sport. Leo\u2019s father Jorge Messi, who \nmeets with Bar\u00e7a technical secretary Txiki Begiristain a few \ndays later, announces: \u2018Leo will do whatever he is obliged 208 Messi\nto do, to avoid being penalised by either party. In the meantime, having played the friendly against \nCatalunya (a match won by Pocho Lavezzi with one of his usual goals), Leo leaves for Argentina in a hurry. Coco Basile \nand the national team await him.\nMessi\u2019s commitments with the national team have fin-\nished; it is holiday time, time for advertising promotions and matches like the one he arranged with Ronaldinho on 28 June at the Monumental de Matur\u00edn in Venezuela, \nthe second instalment of a charity match between Messi\u2019s \nfriends and Ronnie\u2019s friends. Leo Messi is on it. \u2018Argentina will call up Messi in accordance with FIFA regulation, which states that he has to be with his national \nteam at the Olympic Games. If I don\u2019t have Messi I don\u2019t \nhave a team, and if he doesn\u2019t come and play with us, it will spark a precedent which will prompt other teams to ask for The long journey towards gold  209\ntheir players and we don\u2019t want that to happen either. It is \nlogical for him to play for Argentina, since Barcelona have \nhim for the whole year. There are very few competitions in \nwhich Messi can play with his country. If the regulations favour \nus, Messi will play in the Champions League qualifier,\u2019 \nmaintains Begiristain.\nOn 15 July, Barcelona is back in session, with Pep \nGuardiola and without Ronaldinho. Messi would miss the first three \nmatches of the Olympic qualifying stages, but as long as Argentina qualify, he could be there for the quarter-finals. \nThe most they will accept is that Leo will take part in the 210 Messi\nBar\u00e7a pre-season, and then join the national team before \nthe first match. He wants him to be happy playing foot-ball with Bar\u00e7a. In the interim comes Bar\u00e7a\u2019s second friendly against \nDundee United, with three Messi goals, as well as words \nfrom Joan Laporta, the Bar\u00e7a club president, who restates the club\u2019s position, the consensus solution offered to the \nAFA, and announces that in the event of a negative verdict \nfrom FIFA, Barcelona will \u2018turn to the legal guidance of the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) so that our claims are \ntaken into account\u2019. There is less than a \nweek remaining until Argentina\u2019s debut at the Games and no one knows if Leo will be there. On the websites of the \nSpanish and Argentine newspapers, the polls appear in abundance: \u2018Should the national team keep waiting for \nMessi.\n\u2018What should Bar\u00e7a do about Messi. Seventy-three per cent think Messi \nshould participate in the Olympics.212 Messi\n\u2018He has to decide for himself. Either way, \nBarcelona will wait for him. If they gave it to \nhim, it\u2019s not because Messi is a movie star, it\u2019s because he \nis a phenomenon, a great player. \nJorge Messi confirms it: \u2018There is a conflict of interest here \nin which the player is being put in the middle.\u2019\nAnd a few hours later, FIFA says that Messi should go to \nthe Games.\nAfter the match against Fiorentina (3-1 to Bar\u00e7a), \nPep Guardiola comments: \u2018We will survive without Messi. However, I have a feeling that we are a little bit stronger The long journey towards gold  213\nwith Messi. But in the meantime, \ninstead of leaving for the American tour, Leo is off to China, promising to return if the CAS rule in favour of Bar\u00e7a. The first time he saw Leo was at Barcelona, in the match against Catalunya. \u2018I \nwant Messi to come into the centre more, not be pinned \nto the touchline the way he is with Barcelona.\u2019 He \ndenies that there is any problem between him and Riquelme (just before the World Cup qualifier against Brazil there had \nbeen rumours circulating of a dispute between the national \nnumber 10 and Messi). Grondona is the first to make himself heard: \n\u2018Messi is not going anywhere.\n\u2018He has told me that he wants to stay with the squad and \nhe asks Barcelona to be considerate of his position,\u2019 assures Checho. Begiristain does not seem to be considerate: \u2018It is \nour wish \u2013 with our fans in mind \u2013 that Leo Messi be with \nthe club,\u2019 he says. But first, \nGuardiola wants to speak to Leo. Leo Messi asks Guardiola \u2013 who, after \nBarcelona \u201992, knows what it means to win an Olympic gold \n\u2013 to help him: he wants to stay in China and participate in the Games. Messi is to stay \nin Beijing. The first is that the AFA will take responsibility for medical insurance in case \nMessi is injured. \nGuardiola is the one who announces Barcelona\u2019s decision \nto Leo. It falls to Begiristain and Guardiola to make the official announcement regarding the resolution \nof Messi\u2019s case.\u2019\nMessi goes onto the pitch to face the Ivory Coast wear -\ning the Argentine number 15 shirt. \nTowards the end of the first half, he receives a 45-yard pass 216 Messi\nfrom Riquelme, he picks up the pace and, almost from the \npenalty spot, places it delicately into the net. This time it is Leo\u2019s \nturn to speak, and to thank Guardiola. Then, in a few seconds, after various touches between Riquelme and Messi, Rom\u00e1n plays the ball \nout to the left to Di Mar\u00eda, who crosses into the centre and \nPocho Lavezzi converts it.\nOn the other side of the world, two days after 12 August, a \nMessi-less Barcelona also win: 4-0 against Wis\u0142a Cracovia in the first leg of the preliminary round of the Champions League. He spoke to us in Spanish, looked for Messi, and \nchatted to him for a bit. When it came to saying goodbye, he made the gesture of taking off his hat, looked directly at Leo, and \nsaid to him: \u201cMessi, you\u2019re the best.218 Messi\nChecho rests Leo, keeps the already-cautioned Riquelme \nand Ag\u00fcero on the bench, and lets the subs play. It wasn\u2019t only Messi who didn\u2019t play \ntoday.\u2019\nMessi avoids the topic, but he does not shy away from the \navalanche of questions: \u2018I\u2019m not one to make predictions, but Ronnie: remember the gold belongs to Argentina. My \ndream is the dream of the whole Argentine team. And more \nso now, for Ustari, for my friend [Oscar has been injured in the match against Holland and cannot keep goal for the \nAlbiceleste]. Argentine revenge comes in 2005, in Holland. Fifteen players from that final (includ-\ning Messi and Kun) find themselves at the ground in Beijing. Messi and \nAg\u00fcero are alone up front. Until the 57th minute: there is \na scuffle between an Argentine and an African, the ball \nrebounds towards the centre of the pitch, Messi recovers it, \nturns, and passes it perfectly, out deep, to \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. Messi, with his arms \naround Kun, celebrates the fulfilment of the dream.", "Leo_Messi_2009": "\u2019 Perhaps Leo has also felt this good news, conveyed over the noise of Midtown; one thing for sure is that the \nhappiest year of his life began precisely here, in New York, \non the corner of Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, in the Saint Regis hotel suite, when Pep Guardiola convinced Laporta \nand Begiristain to let Messi stay in Beijing. Txiki Begiristain, 224 Messi\nsporting director of Bar\u00e7a, confirms it: \u2018If, when he sees \nyou, he jokes with you, then he\u2019s happy, if he doesn\u2019t seem \nto see you and looks the other way, something\u2019s wrong. Leo has scored more goals than ever \nbefore in his professional career. And let\u2019s not forget the 5,000th goal in the \nCatalan club\u2019s Liga history, which Leo scores on 1 February 2009 in Santander against Racing. His second of the match, which secures a victory for Bar\u00e7a. And nine goals in the \nChampions League, highest goal scorer in the European \ntournament. It\u2019s true that the team\u2019s (spectacu-\nlar) performance has helped him to win these trophies, but Happiness  225\never since he put on the number 10 shirt, Messi has taken \na step forward, he has taken up the mantle in the dressing \nroom and on the pitch, he has given it his all, and done \nit all in an unassuming manner. Champions League \nfinal: Barcelona-Manchester United\nAlthough Messi has one European Cup to his name, it has never felt like his.226 Messi\nThis time it is different. Messi \nscores five goals in the group phase: two against Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine, to reclaim a match which had been \nan uphill struggle for the Blaugrana; another two against \nFC Basel: one in Switzerland, which ended up being a Barcelona attack-fest (0-5), and the other at the Nou Camp. The Blaugrana hero \nis Andr\u00e9s Iniesta with his heavenly shot in the 93rd minute, \nbut it was Leo Messi who supplied the ball to the Blaugrana number 8 in the \u2018D\u2019. \nBarcelona: Vald\u00e9s, Puyol, Tour\u00e9, Piqu\u00e9, Sylvinho, Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Henry, Eto\u2019o.\nThe media is promoting the match as the great duel \nbetween Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi. Cristiano puts his head in his 228 Messi\nhands. Before Messi has touched the ball, the white-shirted \nnumber 7 has given quite a performance: three shots and \na yellow card for Piqu\u00e9, who had tried to stop him with an obstructive foul. His father, Jorge, sees it too: \u2018I saw that Leo was out of the game for quite a while, and only once we scored \nthe goal I began to see him get more involved. Bar\u00e7a begin to take control of the game and although it is not his \nbest night and he only manages to infiltrate the forest of \nwhite shirts a few times, Messi is getting better and better. Manchester United\u2019s French left back, Patrice Evra \u2013 the \nman who won them the duel with Lionel in April 2008 (0-0 \nin the first leg, 1-0 in the return leg) \u2013 had already predicted it: \u2018Messi is \u201chungrier\u201d and he is a better player now than he \nwas a year ago.\u2019\nThe photo: Messi suspended in the air, immobile, high, \nvery high, leaning back. At a press conference in Santander \non 1 February 2009, the day before the match against Racing, when asked if Messi needed to score more headers in order \nto become the best player in the world, the coach from \nSantpedor replied: \u2018I advise you not to test him because one day he\u2019ll score an incredible header and shut you all up.\u2019\nThe curiosity: \u2018I didn\u2019t see my son\u2019s goal,\u2019 admits Jorge \nMessi, in the stands with his wife Celia, Leo\u2019s siblings and their respective families.\u2019 Because no sooner has his \nson come back down to earth \u2013 and before being inundated \nwith hugs from his team-mates \u2013 than he does a lap holding 230 Messi\nup his new blue boot, as homage to Argentina. Cristiano Ronaldo. Later, hurt, and already in his suit, he says: \u2018It \nwasn\u2019t a match between Messi and me, but his team was bet-ter than us, and he was too because he scored. This team \ndeserves it after the great work they have put in all year,\u2019 declares Messi. \u2018Messi, king of Europe,\u2019 runs the headline in \nCorriere dello Sport, the Rome sports paper; \u2018SuperMessi,\u2019 says \nthe Gazzetta dello Sport; \u2018Messi and Barcelona on top of the \nworld,\u2019 reads the headline in La Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires.\u2019 \u2018Marvellous Messi is too much for United,\u2019 reads \nthe headline in The Times, which opts for the same photo as \nEl Pa\u00eds. A smiling Messi, pointing his fingers in the air, and a matter-of-fact headline: \u2018Messi is the best\u2019. True, this Bar\u00e7a team, \ntogether with Messi \u2013 who has already scored 21 goals in the championship \u2013 inspire fear. We have to try not to let Barcelona 232 Messi\nhave a good day and work hard together as a team. And the goals score themselves: because Xavi, the \u2018doctor\u2019, creates \never more beautiful assists; because Iniesta makes one drib-\nbling run after another; because Henry makes a laughing stock of Ramos and scores his second goal; because Messi is \nlike a spirit who appears on any part of the pitch, wherever \nyou least expect him. It is not the first \ntime that Messi is helping this organisation. It is an example of how a \nball in the back of the net can serve as something more than 234 Messi\njust a football result.

We shouldn\u2019t forget that despite his young age, Messi has been among the contenders for the Ballon d\u2019Or several times.

Jos\u00e9 Cruz explains it as follows: \u2018Without Messi Barcelona is the best team in the \nworld; when Leo plays they are from another galaxy. 250 Messi\nThey are the team of the bald \u2018Brujita\u2019 (\u2018little witch\u2019), Juan \nSebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, who was Leo\u2019s mentor in the 2007 Copa \nAm\u00e9rica, the globe-trotter who has become the team\u2019s cen-tral figure and dreams of repeating the achievements of his \nfather Juan Ram\u00f3n \u2018La Bruja\u2019 (\u2018the witch\u2019) Ver\u00f3n.00pm, UEFA president Michel \nPlatini steps up to the podium accompanied by FIFA 252 Messi\npresident  Joseph \u2018Sepp\u2019 Blatter. Then comes the most important moment, the announcement: \u2018The FIFA World Player 2009 \nis Lionel Messi. Maradona has imposed a Messianic \nmodel,\u2019 writes David Gistau in El Mundo, \u2018in which Messi, the child of another time, does not fit; furthermore, he left Argentina very quickly \u2013 as if immersing himself in a kind of \npopular idolatry. They see him as a foreigner, they write \u2018Messi is not Argentine\u2019, because he \nhas given all he can to Bar\u00e7a, he has given it his all in Europe \nand, what\u2019s more, he has ruined Estudiantes\u2019 dream, which was supported by practically the whole country.", "Lionel_Messi_2010": " The only thing left to say is that Messi \nis simply the best.\nAbove all, Messi has been a team player. He demonstrates 280 Messi\nhis wide repertoire: quick runs, passes in from the touchline \nto get round the opponents, assists, and attempts at goal.\nLionel works with Xavi and Iniesta, and together the magic \nthreesome begin to do some damage and take control of the \nball, denying Manchester United any chances. And nobody \ncan do that better than Messi. \u2018I got some space, the goalie came out and luckily it \nwent in,\u2019 says Messi later.\nIn the Champions League, he is in the lead: twelve goals, \nequalling Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record. \nFor the third consecutive year, Messi is the top Champions League goal-scorer.\nTwenty-three years of age, top Champions League scorer \nfor the third time, not to mention winner of fourteen other titles. But statistics and trophies aside, it is worth noting that \nwhen it matters most, Messi is there when needed, he is always a game-changer and he always plays to the best of his abilities. We have demonstrated that we are \ncapable of working very hard, we have talent, and we have \nMessi. He is a unique and irreplaceable footballer.\u2019\nNo, Messi has never failed and he has never been bored, \nnot even for a single minute at Wembley or during the entire 2010\u201311 season. Because, they \nsay, Cristiano is better than Messi, because \u00d6zil is a gen-\nius, because di Mar\u00eda and Benzema are the two best strik-ers.\nMessi hasn\u2019t scored either, breaking a run of ten consec-\nutive games in which he has scored, but he has been gener -\nous and helped set up goals three and four for David Villa \nwith surgical precision. On the pitch, that role belongs to \nMessi. And he is ahead of rival Cristiano Ronaldo 286 Messi\nby thirteen goals. \u2018Messi gives us so much \nmore than goals,\u2019 maintains V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. This time it\u2019s Leo Messi in the spot-light, for kicking a ball into the stands.288 Messi\nAnd where was Messi.\u2019\nThe next day, Lionel Messi is the master on the pitch, \nbut at the press conference it\u2019s Mourinho once again.\nAt the other end, Messi is playing as deep as midfield, \nbeing kept far away from the box where he can do the most damage. Messi gets there first, beating Sergio Ramos to \nthe ball. Messi doesn\u2019t manage to score this time, but he is running all over the shop and keeping up the pressure. \u2018It has \nbeen a very tough year and we have worked extremely hard against Real Madrid, our biggest rival,\u2019 comments Lionel.", "Tionally_Renowned_2005": "", "Outstanding_Goals_2005": "\u2019\nFive years later everything changed \u2026\n\u2018It was after the 2005 Under 20 World Cup.", "Unfinished_Business_2005": " That\u2019s Leo\u2019s unfinished business, never having played here.\n\u2018At the end of 2000.", "Estado_2000": " But one fine day in 2000, Mart\u00edn Montero and Fabi\u00e1n Soldini, \nof Marka \u2013 a company with Rosario headquarters dedicated \nto the buying and selling of players \u2013 introduce themselves at number 525, Estado de Israel.", "Argentine_1995": " I go and see Grondona \n(Julio Grondona, the president of the AFA \u2013 the Argentine \nFootball Association), and I schedule an opportunity to see the kid, in two friendlies, against Paraguay and Uruguay.\u2019\nThe kid was Leo Messi, an unknown from the other side \nof the Atlantic.

In the second half, in the 50th \nminute, when the Argentines are already winning 3-0, Videotape  85\nTocalli approaches him. The next day, Sunday 4 July, the \nBuenos Aires sports magazine Ol\u00e9 writes: \u2018Young Messi is \nthe real deal. He scored two goals, four assists, and was the one to watch in the 4-1 victory over Uruguay. And now Tocalli has no doubts about including him in the squad for the FIFA Under 20 World \nCup qualifiers in South America the following January. While he has just turned \nseventeen, the others are aged between eighteen and 20 and have extensive experience at all levels of the Argentine \nchampionship.\nTime for the South American qualifiers. They are 86 Messi\nplayed at high altitude \u2013 from 1,650 metres in Armenia, to \n2,500 in Manizales \u2013 and the Argentines do not find it par -\nticularly easy to acclimatise. He comes on fifteen minutes after half-time to replace Ezequiel Lavezzi, \nwho today is a tattoo-sporting Napoli centre forward. The Venezuelan defeat is incontest-\nable and Messi\u2019s contribution is significant. \u2018And after five min-\nutes, Messi showed everyone that he is first-class material,\u2019 \nwrites the Argentine newspaper \u00c9poca. \u2018The boy still \nhadn\u2019t got into the rhythm of the entire team, he was used \nto playing in the Bar\u00e7a youth leagues, he didn\u2019t have the same intensity that\u2019s needed to play in South America \u2026 \nthey were very demanding matches. At the end of the \nrun, Argentina qualifies in third place for the FIFA Under \n20 World Cup in Holland, behind Colombia and Brazil. Messi has scored five goals \u2013 the second highest goal-scorer \nafter the Colombian Hugo Rodallega, who netted eleven.\u2019 And FIFA rightfully counts him among the eleven \nbest players in South America \u2013 an accolade that helps to win over the selector.

One thing for sure is that the Argentine team is one of the favourites to win \nthe tournament. They won three out of four times (in Qatar in 1995, in Malaysia in 1997 and in Argentina in 2001), all \nunder Pekerman\u2019s reign, and let\u2019s not forget the 1979 vic-\ntory in Japan, where Diego Maradona was the protagonist.

But let\u2019s return to a game which has no \nprecedent, because Bar\u00e7a are unstoppable. Real Madrid\u2019s Liga career \nis over. And no one will knock Barcelona off the top spot, since they are now seven points clear. But this match serves as a reminder of the show put on by Leo Messi and Guardiola\u2019s Blaugrana team through-\nout the entire season, in Spain as well as in Europe.

Return leg of \nthe Spanish Super Cup: Barcelona-Athletic Bilbao\nHe didn\u2019t play in the first leg in San Mam\u00e9s, but in the return \nleg, a week later, Lionel is on the pitch from the first minute onwards. Without Leo, Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c and the injured Iniesta, Pep\u2019s team returned \nfrom Bilbao with a 1-2 result (goals from De Marcos, Xavi \nand Pedro) and the Super Cup almost in the bag. In reality it is a strange final, since Bar\u00e7a should have had to play against \nthemselves, being both Liga and Copa del Rey champions, \nbut the organisation has stipulated that they should face the Copa del Rey runners-up, Athletic Bilbao. It makes no differ -\nence, because in front of their fans, Bar\u00e7a are in fact playing Bar\u00e7a: although they are persistent and they put up a noble fight, the Athletic players are mere testimonial witnesses. Xavi Happiness  237\npasses to Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c, the striker back-heels it to Messi, and \nthe Argentine dodges past the central defender with his left \nfoot, in order to bounce the ball into the goalmouth with his \nright. It is the advantage that has been a while com-\ning, because throughout the first half, Bar\u00e7a have not been \nvery precise when it comes to finishing. It is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s fourth consecu-\ntive title. UEFA Super Cup: \nBarcelona-Shakhtar Donetsk\u2018Leo left it to me. He is a 22-year-old Brazilian player, and Barcelona\u2019s number 17. He arrived at Barcelona as a boy of \nfifteen, and is one of eight called upon by Pep Guardiola \nfor the seemingly endless UEFA Super Cup match. The eternal reserves player just signed his first professional con-\ntract with Bar\u00e7a on 20 August; he is the striker who won the \nChampions League after only playing one minute of foot-ball and without even touching the ball. Well \u2026 in the 81st \nminute Pedrito comes on for Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c and in the \n115th, after a back-and-forth with Messi, he finds the perfect angle, the gap just by Pyatov\u2019s goalpost, in order to draw a \nline under a gruelling match and win Bar\u00e7a their fifth cup \nof the season. But the Bar\u00e7a \nnumber 10 and his team-mates never tire of looking for the gaps, undeterred by the fact that Lucescu\u2019s men turn the \ncounter-attack into their greatest weapon. It is shot number 21 for Bar\u00e7a, and it is the vic-\ntory shot. The Brazilian kicks it with his right while falling \nto the ground and sends this Bar\u00e7a team on their way to being legendary. It is the goal that brings Pep\u2019s team in line \nwith Bar\u00e7a\u2019s five-cup team: the magnificent team made up \nof Ramallets, Mart\u00edn, Biosca, Seguer, Gonzalvo III, Bosch, Basora, C\u00e9sar, Vila, Kubala and Manch\u00f3n. By contrast, Leo\u2019s Bar\u00e7a have won all five cups on the pitch. We will wait \u2026 Leo has all he needs in order to keep both them and future generations \ncomfortable: on 18 September 2009, he renews his contract \nwith Barcelona for the fourth year running. After coming third in 2007 and \nsecond in 2008, Lionel Andr\u00e9s Messi wins France Football \nmagazine\u2019s 2009 Ballon d\u2019Or. Messi is champion of Europe, of La Liga with Barcelona, winner of the European Super Cup and the Copa del Rey, and with the Argentine side has qualified for the final stages of the World Cup.00pm on Monday 30 November 2009 when France \nFootball\u2019s representatives knock on the door of Messi\u2019s cha-\nlet in Castelldefels to deliver the good news.\nThe announcement comes at the end of a fantastic \nweek for both Leo and Bar\u00e7a. On Tuesday 24 November, in the fifth match of the Champions League, the Blaugrana, \nwith Piqu\u00e9 and Pedro, \u2018achieved an angelic victory over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Inter in a devilish match\u2019, in the words of \nEl Pa\u00eds. Messi was unable to play in that \nmatch as he had sustained a muscular injury while playing \nAthletic Bilbao at San Mam\u00e9s on the final match day of La Liga, but on Sunday 29 November he is in the starting line-\nup for the classic derby against Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Real \nMadrid. His \nshot is turned away by Vald\u00e9s, and for the fourth time he \nfails to score against Bar\u00e7a. However, in the second half, after Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c puts Bar\u00e7a ahead with an unstoppable \nleft-footed shot and Busquets gets a red card, the Flea is \nonce again at his best. Alves crosses it into the centre from the right wing \nand Lionel shoots point-blank, which the incredible Casillas 244 Messi\nsaves. The most \nimportant thing is that Barcelona won.)\nAnd since Leo belongs to Bar\u00e7a as much as he does to \nArgentina, he does not forget how valuable the prize is to his \u2018home\u2019 team: \u2018The fact that I am the first footballer trained \nin the Bar\u00e7a youth academy to win this award really helps the \u201cBar\u00e7a project\u201d, and is very important for both the club \nand the people who work at the club. I knew him from Bar\u00e7a B  \nbut had never had direct contact with him.\u2019\nThe Bar\u00e7a coach replies: \u2018Leo is the rightful winner \nbecause as a player he is simply on another level.\nThe best footballer of 2009 is crowned on 6 December \n2009 at 11. After that there is a photo session with his family, friends and Bar\u00e7a president Joan Laporta, as well \nas people from the club, France Football and the French TV \nchannel TF1. In the meantime, Bar\u00e7a have other challenges ahead. But Bar\u00e7a do not \nfall apart, they keep the ball from the Ukrainians, they push ahead without stopping, until they manage first to equalise \n(thanks to Xavi), and then to claim victory.\nAn emotional moment and huge applause, before the \nlong trip to Abu Dhabi, where Bar\u00e7a will face Mexican club Atlante in the semi-final on Wednesday 16 December, \nAtlante having just beaten Auckland City 3-0. Leo and the whole of Bar\u00e7a are immersed in the \ncompetition, concentrating extremely hard on training in \nthe lead-up to the game against Atlante, who are known as the Iron Colts. All predictions favour the Catalans far above \nthe CONCACAF champions, but the Bar\u00e7a fans have not \nforgotten the two finals they lost in 1992 and 2006. In the 35th minute Sergio Busquets equalises. Nonetheless Bar\u00e7a Third time lucky  249\ncannot  handle Atlante. But Bar\u00e7a have stalled, and \nGuardiola makes use of him in the 53rd minute. It is his first touch, and it is 1-2; the Mexican resistance is over; Bar\u00e7a has woken up; Pedro nets the third, becoming \nthe only footballer in history to have scored in six different \nclub competitions in one season; now the eleven Blaugrana players can dedicate themselves to delighting the crowd \nwith kicks and touches. The chances come \none after the other and Messi allows himself the luxury of missing another head-to-head with Vilar, the Argentine \ngoalie, whom he knows well from the Albiceleste. Jos\u00e9 Cruz explains it as follows: \u2018Without Messi Barcelona is the best team in the \nworld; when Leo plays they are from another galaxy. 250 Messi\nThey are the team of the bald \u2018Brujita\u2019 (\u2018little witch\u2019), Juan \nSebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, who was Leo\u2019s mentor in the 2007 Copa \nAm\u00e9rica, the globe-trotter who has become the team\u2019s cen-tral figure and dreams of repeating the achievements of his \nfather Juan Ram\u00f3n \u2018La Bruja\u2019 (\u2018the witch\u2019) Ver\u00f3n. Bar\u00e7a find themselves in the worst pos-\nsible scenario: a goal down, no goals of their own, Messi with a yellow card to his name and, above all, a team that \nis lost and can find neither gaps in midfield, nor decisive \npasses. Bar\u00e7a \ndo not give up, they show all their strength of character, all \ntheir determination, they try again and again until Xavi gets it in the box in the final minutes. And Bar\u00e7a have won, the Argentines know it. After the 1992 and 2006 defeats, Bar\u00e7a win the trophy for the first time in the \nclub\u2019s 110-year history.

On 22 June 1986, Maradona anticipated Peter Shilton, 15cm taller than he was, coming off his line. Despite the technol-\nogy available in 2007 and to the Espanyol players\u2019 despair, Rodr\u00edguez Santiago also allows the goal. Maradona is reluc-\ntant to admit what everyone already knows, \u2018that the Hand \nof God was the hand of Diego.\nDiego and Lionel, Messi and Maradona, the disciple \nand the master. Ariel \u2018the Tiger\u2019 Z\u00e1rate, a 29-year-old from Entre R\u00edos, who performs in a group of four Argentine \nmusicians, has dedicated a song to the subject, called \u2018El Pie de Oro lleg\u00f3\u2019 (\u2018The Golden Foot has arrived\u2019 \u2013 a play on \nMaradona\u2019s nickname \u2018El Pibe de Oro\u2019, meaning Golden \nBoy). It goes like this:\nOn 24 June in \u201987\nA year after Argentina became championsA star was born, a new dreamThe Golden Foot was born in Rosario.\nNow Messi has his own songwriter, just as Maradona had El \nPotro Rodrigo. Lionel has always been compared to Maradona in one \nform or another. \u2018I have seen him do stunning things with the \nball, which not even Maradona could do at that age,\u2019 insists \nVecchio. \u2018Messi is the closest I \nhave seen to Diego. River Plate ex-number 10 Norberto Alonso says, for example: \u2018There \nare things about him which remind me of Maradona. But Diego had that game-altering vision \nwhich Messi lacks. \u2018Messi is \nlike Maradona but with a turbo attached to his feet.\u2019 Nor do footballers past and present, like Eto\u2019o: \u2018Messi is the Diego Armando Maradona of the future\u2019, or Deco: \u2018He \nreminds me a lot of Maradona. Sometimes I hear people \nsay that he should beware of the fame so that what hap-pened to Diego doesn\u2019t happen to him.\u2019 And Franz Beckenbauer: \u2018When we see him run with the ball we are reminded of \nDiego Maradona at his best, with good reason. \u2018Between Messi and Maradona,\u2019 maintains H\u00e9ctor \n\u2018El Negro\u2019 Enrique, \u201986 World Champion with Argentina, \n\u2018there are two things they have in common: their running style and their speed. The bad thing is not \nthat he\u2019s compared to Maradona, but that Leo believes he is Maradona. Leo and Diego  171\nThe ex-Fiorentina striker and highest-ever goal scorer for \nArgentina says: \u2018Leo shouldn\u2019t try to imitate Maradona, he \nonly has to be himself and do the best he can. Because oth-\nerwise, even if he reaches Diego\u2019s level, he will only be seen as the second Maradona.\u2019 The discordant voices are few in \nnumber, one of them being Pel\u00e9, although it is fairly natural \nbearing in mind the issue relates to Maradona. Maradona used to come from behind. On the other hand Diego was a better armed footballer. \u2018He is not the new Maradona. In Argentina, and in other countries as well, every time a kid comes along who \nhas good technical skills and abilities and who is decisive, \nthe whole world declares him as the next Diego. Messi is a very good player, left-footed, skilled, powerful, he plays for \nBarcelona and he\u2019s Argentine. But he is not Maradona, he \nis Messi.\u2019 Writer, journalist and psychologist Walter Vargas is categorical, maintaining in his book, Football Delivery: \u2018Messi \nis not and never will be Maradona. \nThey show that Messi and Maradona share a series of physi-\ncal traits: low centre of gravity, muscle mass, height, weight, development and, of course, they are both left-footed. He has seen 172 Messi\nMaradona play and he won\u2019t hear of any comparisons. He \nlists Messi\u2019s weaknesses, from his taking of free kicks to his \nvision of the game, and he glorifies Maradona\u2019s gifts, asking his inquirer if he remembers the number 10\u2019s first goals \nwith the Argentinos Juniors. Let\u2019s move on to Luis, who \nhas a photo of Maradona in action in his completely bostero \n(Boca fan) shop, with the inscription, \u2018Your children and \nyour children\u2019s children will ask about him. Juli\u00e1n, aged ten, the most \nchatty of them all, says emphatically: \u2018I\u2019m a Boca fan, but I like Messi, I like the way he plays. \u2018The old folks who maintain that Messi will never reach the \nlevel of Maradona forget what everyone always says when a \nnew superstar appears: he\u2019ll never make it. They said that Maradona was chubby, too small and that he would never \nbecome a champion at the level of the greats. The great \ngoalie Hugo Gatti was one of the ones who talked inces-santly about how round Maradona was, and Diego scored \nfour goals against him. It\u2019s simple: ever since Maradona retired in 1997, the Argentines \u2013 and oth-\ners too \u2013 are always in search of a successor. And \nwho makes us think back to old times \u2013 because memory is a fundamental aspect of football; because in order for \na young player to sell, it is easier to hang a tag around his \nneck saying \u2018New Pel\u00e9\u2019 or \u2018New Maradona\u2019. As was the case, just in terms of \u2018New Maradonas\u2019, with Ariel Ortega, \nPablo Aimar, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme, or the \u2018Apache\u2019 T\u00e9vez. Even more so when there are so many coincidences, as there are in Messi\u2019s case: little; \nleft-footed; grew up at Newell\u2019s, where Maradona spent a \nbrief stint; matured at Barcelona, the first European club to experience \u2018Maramondo\u2019; Under 20 world champion, like \nMaradona in 1979. And debuted with the national team \nagainst Hungary, exactly like Diego. And it is even more difficult when Maradona himself invites you onto his TV \nprogramme, La Noche del 10 (Number 10 Night) and singles \nyou out as his heir. Many think that he already is, but in my opinion,\u2019 \nsays Maradona, \u2018he has hardly begun playing.\u2019 When they ask him about it in El \nGr\u00e1fico, he responds that of course Leo is the best current \nArgentine player, but in response to the next question \u2013 \u2018Will Leo be able to overtake you.\u2019 \u2013 he offers: \u2018If it is for the \ngood of Argentine football, let him overtake me.", "Youth_Leagues_1995": "", "Minutes_1995": "", "Minutes_1978": " His \nWorld Cup debut comes in the 74th minute.

The explanation is given via an official announcement:\n\u2018FC Barcelona has decided not to play Leo Messi in the \nmatch against Alav\u00e9s as a matter of caution, in light of the outstanding legal issue that will shortly be resolved within \nthe confines of federal regulation relating to non-EU \nplayers. Messi meets all of 102 Messi\nthe required criteria to fulfil this regulation, which means \nthat despite the club\u2019s three non-EU positions already being \nfilled by Ronaldinho, Eto\u2019o and M\u00e1rquez, he should be able \nto play. In other words, \u2018due to the temporary \nsituation, the FC Barcelona legal department have advised against allowing him to play\u2019.\nIt is a difficult scenario to comprehend, given that in the \n2004\u201305 season Leo played in a Champions League game with the first team against Shakhtar Donetsk, as well as in \nseven league games \u2013 with no professional licence and no \nEU documents, only his contracts for the youth team and the Barcelona Second Division B team. \nNonetheless, it is an unforgettable night for Leo \u2013 the reali-sation of a childhood dream, just as he was quoted in La \nCapital as saying that his goal was to \u2018make it into the first \nteam\u2019. It is 1 May 2005, the Nou Camp scoreboard indicates that there are three minutes remaining, and \nBar\u00e7a are 1-0 up against Albacete. \nHe is the youngest player in the club\u2019s history to score in a league game (a record later broken on 20 October 2007, \nwhen Bojan Krki\u00b4 c scored against Villarreal).\nThings have gone well for him in the first team, but after \nthat 1 May match, the Argentine will not play another offi-cial match that season \u2013 not even after Bar\u00e7a have done \nenough to ensure their seventeenth league title. Messi is an unresolved case.\nWith news of the possibility that Leo might not be able to \nplay in the league come other suggestions, such as forfeiting him to another club who have a non-EU spot open. The Italian club\u2019s presi-\ndent, Massimo Moratti, has never tried to hide his interest \nin the player and has even made a financially attractive offer to Jorge Messi \u2013 who tries to use this bargaining chip to put \npressure on Barcelona to resolve the issue.\nMeanwhile, on 31 August (the closing date for new team \nsignings), FC Barcelona renew Messi\u2019s licence as a youth player naturalised in the team that plays in the Second \nDivision B. And on 16 September, the news that the player 104 Messi\nhas signed a professional contract goes public. \u2018A week after his eighteenth birthday, Leo Messi has received his greatest present. Team \nsecretary Txiki Begiristain has travelled to Utrecht, Holland, \nwith the player\u2019s father, in order to draw up his new con-tract, which guarantees him a place at the club until 2010,\u2019 \nreads the Bar\u00e7a website on 30 June, while the youngster is \nplaying in the FIFA Under 20 World Cup. One \nthing for sure is that Messi cannot play in the league. After examining the documents sent over by \nBarcelona, UEFA has agreed that he can play.

goals in the first slew of fix-\ntures at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season; 21 goals in \n22 matches since he scored the hat-trick against Real Madrid in March 2007. \u2018Messi is \na

I was betting on \nRodrigo, who was a good striker.", "Cristiano_Ronaldo_2010": "\nAbove all, Messi has been a team player.\nHe has scored 53 goals in 54 games this season (31 in La \nLiga, twelve in the Champions League, seven in the Copa del Rey and three in the Spanish Supercup). He is level with \nCristiano Ronaldo, who has claimed the title of top Liga \nscorer with 40 goals \u2013 a title which doesn\u2019t seem to matter much to the Flea.\nIn the Champions League, he is in the lead: twelve goals, \nequalling Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record. \nFor the third consecutive year, Messi is the top Champions League goal-scorer. In 2008\u201309 he scored nine, and despite \nnot reaching the final in 2009\u201310, he was crowned top \nscorer with eight goals.\nHe has scored a total of 39 goals in his 59 Champions \nLeague matches, a fantastic achievement.\nTwenty-three years of age, top Champions League scorer \nfor the third time, not to mention winner of fourteen other titles. He is a unique and irreplaceable footballer. It has been a year tempered by the eternal \nduel with Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo. Because, they \nsay, Cristiano is better than Messi, because \u00d6zil is a gen-\nius, because di Mar\u00eda and Benzema are the two best strik-ers. Because Mourinho is not Manuel Pellegrini, nor is he \nBernd Schuster or Juande Ramos or even Fabio Capello. Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s free kick from 45 yards \nwhich grazes the outside edge of Vald\u00e9s\u2019s goalpost, and a \nshove against Guardiola after an offside decision \u2013 which creates a general commotion and an argument between the \nmanagers \u2013 have all been long since forgotten. On the pitch, that role belongs to \nMessi. He is the highest scoring Bar\u00e7a player in a single season, beat-\ning Ronaldo Nazario\u2019s 1996\u201397 record when Bobby Robson \nwas the coach. And he is ahead of rival Cristiano Ronaldo 286 Messi\nby thirteen goals. But he has never scored against a team led by Mourinho and this will be his ninth game against him. In the 82nd minute, rival \nCristiano Ronaldo doesn\u2019t miss either. The game at Mestalla stadium breaks down into three distinct parts: in the first half, Madrid play superbly; in the second half, Bar\u00e7a shine; but in extra time it\u2019s \nCristiano Ronaldo and Mourinho who are the winners. The \nPortuguese number 7 gets round Adriano and nets a pow-erful header after a curling cross from di Mar\u00eda. \u2018Since Mr Mourinho has \naddressed me in such familiar terms and called me \u201cPep\u201d, \nI\u2019ll call him \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d,\u2019 he begins. Let him have the Champions League.\u2019\nThe next day, Lionel Messi is the master on the pitch, \nbut at the press conference it\u2019s Mourinho once again.

It\u2019s natural that the Argentines should feel reticent about trading him in as \nif he were a mere football sticker. As well as the debate over which goal is better, another question \narises: that of Messi\u2019s intentions, or in other words, to quote La Naci\u00f3n, \u2018Was Messi trying to imitate Maradona. \u2018Perhaps the play was \nsimilar, I have only seen it once on television,\u2019 declares Messi, \u2018but I never thought it could be the same as Diego\u2019s goal.\u2019\nThat air of simplicity, as if it was something normal \n(and deep down it is, it is part of his job), is reminiscent of Maradona in \u201986, or at least it is if we go by the memories \nof Jorge Valdano. \u2018Diego insists that he tried to pass me the \nball various times, but he kept finding obstacles that pre-vented him,\u2019 he says, although he is convinced that in real-\nity Diego \u2018was never willing to let go of that ball\u2019. Valdano \noffered Maradona the chance to pass; in Messi\u2019s case it was Eto\u2019o.

In the Mexico World Cup it was H\u00e9ctor Enrique who laid claim to his contribution to the goal and the pre-\nvious pass; here, Xavi does the same. \u2018I dedicate it to Diego. I want to send him all my support and best wishes and hope that he gets out of there \nas soon as possible and recovers, because that is what the \nwhole of Argentina and all football fans everywhere want.\u2019166 Messi\nDiego Armando Maradona is in hospital. In Argentina they even announce his \ndeath.

Let\u2019s hear from Maradona: \u2018Those \nwho made that comparison were exaggerating.

On 22 June 1986, Maradona anticipated Peter Shilton, 15cm taller than he was, coming off his line. Despite the technol-\nogy available in 2007 and to the Espanyol players\u2019 despair, Rodr\u00edguez Santiago also allows the goal. Maradona is reluc-\ntant to admit what everyone already knows, \u2018that the Hand \nof God was the hand of Diego.\nDiego and Lionel, Messi and Maradona, the disciple \nand the master. Ariel \u2018the Tiger\u2019 Z\u00e1rate, a 29-year-old from Entre R\u00edos, who performs in a group of four Argentine \nmusicians, has dedicated a song to the subject, called \u2018El Pie de Oro lleg\u00f3\u2019 (\u2018The Golden Foot has arrived\u2019 \u2013 a play on \nMaradona\u2019s nickname \u2018El Pibe de Oro\u2019, meaning Golden \nBoy). It goes like this:\nOn 24 June in \u201987\nA year after Argentina became championsA star was born, a new dreamThe Golden Foot was born in Rosario.\nNow Messi has his own songwriter, just as Maradona had El \nPotro Rodrigo. Lionel has always been compared to Maradona in one \nform or another. The first to draw parallels were his Newell\u2019s \ncoaches, from Enrique Dom\u00ednguez to Ernesto Vecchio, via Adr\u00edan Coria. \u2018I have seen him do stunning things with the \nball, which not even Maradona could do at that age,\u2019 insists \nVecchio. \u2018Messi is the closest I \nhave seen to Diego. River Plate ex-number 10 Norberto Alonso says, for example: \u2018There \nare things about him which remind me of Maradona. But Diego had that game-altering vision \nwhich Messi lacks. \u2018Messi is \nlike Maradona but with a turbo attached to his feet.\u2019 Nor do footballers past and present, like Eto\u2019o: \u2018Messi is the Diego Armando Maradona of the future\u2019, or Deco: \u2018He \nreminds me a lot of Maradona. Sometimes I hear people \nsay that he should beware of the fame so that what hap-pened to Diego doesn\u2019t happen to him.\u2019 And Franz Beckenbauer: \u2018When we see him run with the ball we are reminded of \nDiego Maradona at his best, with good reason. \u2018Between Messi and Maradona,\u2019 maintains H\u00e9ctor \n\u2018El Negro\u2019 Enrique, \u201986 World Champion with Argentina, \n\u2018there are two things they have in common: their running style and their speed. The bad thing is not \nthat he\u2019s compared to Maradona, but that Leo believes he is Maradona. Leo and Diego  171\nThe ex-Fiorentina striker and highest-ever goal scorer for \nArgentina says: \u2018Leo shouldn\u2019t try to imitate Maradona, he \nonly has to be himself and do the best he can. Because oth-\nerwise, even if he reaches Diego\u2019s level, he will only be seen as the second Maradona.\u2019 The discordant voices are few in \nnumber, one of them being Pel\u00e9, although it is fairly natural \nbearing in mind the issue relates to Maradona. Maradona used to come from behind. On the other hand Diego was a better armed footballer. \u2018He is not the new Maradona. In Argentina, and in other countries as well, every time a kid comes along who \nhas good technical skills and abilities and who is decisive, \nthe whole world declares him as the next Diego. Messi is a very good player, left-footed, skilled, powerful, he plays for \nBarcelona and he\u2019s Argentine. But he is not Maradona, he \nis Messi.\u2019 Writer, journalist and psychologist Walter Vargas is categorical, maintaining in his book, Football Delivery: \u2018Messi \nis not and never will be Maradona. \nBut there\u2019s more: the Argentine Olympic Committee even \ncarries out a study, overseen by Miguel Toderi, in order to scientifically compare the two players. \nThey show that Messi and Maradona share a series of physi-\ncal traits: low centre of gravity, muscle mass, height, weight, development and, of course, they are both left-footed. Rodrigo, in his blue and yellow Boca Juniors shirt, \ndoes not want to hear or speak of the matter. He has seen 172 Messi\nMaradona play and he won\u2019t hear of any comparisons. He \nlists Messi\u2019s weaknesses, from his taking of free kicks to his \nvision of the game, and he glorifies Maradona\u2019s gifts, asking his inquirer if he remembers the number 10\u2019s first goals \nwith the Argentinos Juniors. Let\u2019s move on to Luis, who \nhas a photo of Maradona in action in his completely bostero \n(Boca fan) shop, with the inscription, \u2018Your children and \nyour children\u2019s children will ask about him. Juli\u00e1n, aged ten, the most \nchatty of them all, says emphatically: \u2018I\u2019m a Boca fan, but I like Messi, I like the way he plays. \u2018The old folks who maintain that Messi will never reach the \nlevel of Maradona forget what everyone always says when a \nnew superstar appears: he\u2019ll never make it. They said that Maradona was chubby, too small and that he would never \nbecome a champion at the level of the greats. The great \ngoalie Hugo Gatti was one of the ones who talked inces-santly about how round Maradona was, and Diego scored \nfour goals against him. It\u2019s simple: ever since Maradona retired in 1997, the Argentines \u2013 and oth-\ners too \u2013 are always in search of a successor. And \nwho makes us think back to old times \u2013 because memory is a fundamental aspect of football; because in order for \na young player to sell, it is easier to hang a tag around his \nneck saying \u2018New Pel\u00e9\u2019 or \u2018New Maradona\u2019. As was the case, just in terms of \u2018New Maradonas\u2019, with Ariel Ortega, \nPablo Aimar, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme, or the \u2018Apache\u2019 T\u00e9vez. Even more so when there are so many coincidences, as there are in Messi\u2019s case: little; \nleft-footed; grew up at Newell\u2019s, where Maradona spent a \nbrief stint; matured at Barcelona, the first European club to experience \u2018Maramondo\u2019; Under 20 world champion, like \nMaradona in 1979. And debuted with the national team \nagainst Hungary, exactly like Diego. And it is even more difficult when Maradona himself invites you onto his TV \nprogramme, La Noche del 10 (Number 10 Night) and singles \nyou out as his heir. Many think that he already is, but in my opinion,\u2019 \nsays Maradona, \u2018he has hardly begun playing.\u2019 When they ask him about it in El \nGr\u00e1fico, he responds that of course Leo is the best current \nArgentine player, but in response to the next question \u2013 \u2018Will Leo be able to overtake you.\u2019 \u2013 he offers: \u2018If it is for the \ngood of Argentine football, let him overtake me.", "Thousands_Of_Clips_2003": " Thousands of clips of the two goals were posted on the Internet, and I\u2019ve seen at least another twenty \nsimilar ones.", "Surprised_2003": "", "Surprised_2010": "", "Encountering_Difficulties_2003": "", "Mexico_In_\u201986_2010": " You had it in the national team that \nwon the World Cup in Mexico in \u201986; in Italy in \u201990 when the \nAlbiceleste reached the final; and in Sevilla; and you were by his side in the 2010 World Cup.", "Italy_In_\u201990_2010": " You had it in the national team that \nwon the World Cup in Mexico in \u201986; in Italy in \u201990 when the \nAlbiceleste reached the final; and in Sevilla; and you were by his side in the 2010 World Cup.", "Footballing_Thought_2010": "\n\u2018Comparisons are an eternal feature of football.", "Champions_Thinking_2010": "", "Bilardo_2010": " All of them are \ntitles that Bilardo has garnered over the length of his suc-cessful career as a footballer and coach, as much in his own \ncountry as abroad.", "Carlos_Salvador_Bilardo_2010": " All of them are \ntitles that Bilardo has garnered over the length of his suc-cessful career as a footballer and coach, as much in his own \ncountry as abroad.

Coco Basile \nand the national team await him.\nMessi\u2019s commitments with the national team have fin-\nished; it is holiday time, time for advertising promotions and matches like the one he arranged with Ronaldinho on 28 June at the Monumental de Matur\u00edn in Venezuela, \nthe second instalment of a charity match between Messi\u2019s \nfriends and Ronnie\u2019s friends. Leo Messi is on it. It is \nlogical for him to play for Argentina, since Barcelona have \nhim for the whole year. If the regulations favour \nus, Messi will play in the Champions League qualifier,\u2019 \nmaintains Begiristain.\nOn 15 July, Barcelona is back in session, with Pep \nGuardiola and without Ronaldinho. The Brazilian only has to complete his medical before he can play for Milan. \nBar\u00e7a had refused, since Ronnie is over 23 and FIFA does \nnot oblige clubs to relinquish players older than 23. But Bar\u00e7a have not agreed. \nThe most they will accept is that Leo will take part in the 210 Messi\nBar\u00e7a pre-season, and then join the national team before \nthe first match. They think that Bar\u00e7a will not want to come up against them, FIFA and, above all, the \nplayer, who has always expressed his desire to participate in \nthe Olympics. It is a minor incident, it\u2019s silly; nonetheless \nit affects the new Bar\u00e7a coach. He wants him to be happy playing foot-ball with Bar\u00e7a.

In the interim comes Bar\u00e7a\u2019s second friendly against \nDundee United, with three Messi goals, as well as words \nfrom Joan Laporta, the Bar\u00e7a club president, who restates the club\u2019s position, the consensus solution offered to the \nAFA, and announces that in the event of a negative verdict \nfrom FIFA, Barcelona will \u2018turn to the legal guidance of the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) so that our claims are \ntaken into account\u2019.\n\u2018What should Bar\u00e7a do about Messi. \u2018He is doing the right thing by not saying anything, because after the Olympics \nhe is going to go back to playing with Barcelona and the \nnational team.212 Messi\n\u2018He has to decide for himself. Either way, \nBarcelona will wait for him.\nAfter the match against Fiorentina (3-1 to Bar\u00e7a), \nPep Guardiola comments: \u2018We will survive without Messi. If he does not eventually return, we will ensure \nthe team qualifies for the Champions League. The first time he saw Leo was at Barcelona, in the match against Catalunya. \u2018I \nwant Messi to come into the centre more, not be pinned \nto the touchline the way he is with Barcelona.

Begiristain does not seem to be considerate: \u2018It is \nour wish \u2013 with our fans in mind \u2013 that Leo Messi be with \nthe club,\u2019 he says.

The \nBar\u00e7a fan-base knows that we have an extraordinary player and that he will do wonderful things when he returns.\nOn the other side of the world, two days after 12 August, a \nMessi-less Barcelona also win: 4-0 against Wis\u0142a Cracovia in the first leg of the preliminary round of the Champions League.

We shouldn\u2019t forget that despite his young age, Messi has been among the contenders for the Ballon d\u2019Or several times. Clearly, modern football will not give its highest honour to a flash in the pan, even one as impressive as Messi.

Describing his reasons for vot-\ning for Messi, the Daily Telegraph journalist Henry Winter \nwrites in France Football:\nMessi.00pm on Monday 30 November 2009 when France \nFootball\u2019s representatives knock on the door of Messi\u2019s cha-\nlet in Castelldefels to deliver the good news.\nThe announcement comes at the end of a fantastic \nweek for both Leo and Bar\u00e7a. On Tuesday 24 November, in the fifth match of the Champions League, the Blaugrana, \nwith Piqu\u00e9 and Pedro, \u2018achieved an angelic victory over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Inter in a devilish match\u2019, in the words of \nEl Pa\u00eds. Messi was unable to play in that \nmatch as he had sustained a muscular injury while playing \nAthletic Bilbao at San Mam\u00e9s on the final match day of La Liga, but on Sunday 29 November he is in the starting line-\nup for the classic derby against Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Real \nMadrid. His \nshot is turned away by Vald\u00e9s, and for the fourth time he \nfails to score against Bar\u00e7a. Messi appears very little in the first half; he does not create play and his contribution is \nnot decisive. However, in the second half, after Ibrahimovi\u00b4 c puts Bar\u00e7a ahead with an unstoppable \nleft-footed shot and Busquets gets a red card, the Flea is \nonce again at his best. Alves crosses it into the centre from the right wing \nand Lionel shoots point-blank, which the incredible Casillas 244 Messi\nsaves. It would have been a great pleasure for Messi to score \nhis eighth goal against the Madrid keeper \u2013 his last one was \na penalty in the friendly between Spain and Argentina on 14 November \u2013 but, as he says in his post-match interview, \n\u2018it was not to be, because of Casillas\u2019 great save. The most \nimportant thing is that Barcelona won.\nThe next day sees more front pages devoted to Messi, a \nhuge press conference and interviews. \u2018I cannot lie \u2013 I had a feeling that it could happen this year \u2013 but the results of the ballot surprised me,\u2019 says Messi in the Nou Camp press room.)\nAnd since Leo belongs to Bar\u00e7a as much as he does to \nArgentina, he does not forget how valuable the prize is to his \u2018home\u2019 team: \u2018The fact that I am the first footballer trained \nin the Bar\u00e7a youth academy to win this award really helps the \u201cBar\u00e7a project\u201d, and is very important for both the club \nand the people who work at the club. I knew him from Bar\u00e7a B  \nbut had never had direct contact with him.\u2019\nThe Bar\u00e7a coach replies: \u2018Leo is the rightful winner \nbecause as a player he is simply on another level. He has everything \u2013 he is tough, quick, scores goals even with his \nhead [and who would dare to argue with this after the goal \nhe scored in this way in the Champions League final.\u2019246 Messi\nAnd the boss is not the only one who is full of praise.\nThe best footballer of 2009 is crowned on 6 December \n2009 at 11. But the day before \nthe ceremony, Messi has a match to play against Deportivo \nde La Coru\u00f1a, in the Riazor stadium. The \nspectators in the old Galician stadium shout \u2018Messi, Messi, \nMessi. Messi parades \nround the city, wearing a suit, tie and make-up, and stops in front of the Eiffel Tower before going into the television \nstudio, where he is greeted by his former Bar\u00e7a team-mate Lilian Thuram. After that there is a photo session with his family, friends and Bar\u00e7a president Joan Laporta, as well \nas people from the club, France Football and the French TV \nchannel TF1. In the meantime, Bar\u00e7a have other challenges ahead. But Bar\u00e7a do not \nfall apart, they keep the ball from the Ukrainians, they push ahead without stopping, until they manage first to equalise \n(thanks to Xavi), and then to claim victory. They have been pounding on Messi continually.

cameras focus in on the three home-grown candi-\ndates \u2013 Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez. A moment of confusion ensues 270 Messi\nwhile the gaffer turns it over, before finally announcing: \n\u2018Lionel Messi\u2019.\nDespite all bets being on Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi \nHern\u00e1ndez as the favourites, Messi has won the 2010 FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or.\n\u2018Messi deserves it. The kid from Rosario has been perfectly calm at \nthe gala during the lead-up to the announcement, much \nmore so than he was at the same venue in 2009 when he 272 Messi\ncollected FIFA World Player of the Year. Unlike Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho who knew beforehand that he had beaten Spain\u2019s \nmanager Vicente del Bosque as well as Pep Guardiola to the best manager prize, Messi has no idea that he will be win-\nning his second Ballon d\u2019Or. Which is why, when he comes onto the Palace of Congress stage as a member of the \n\u2018best eleven of 2010\u2019 (Casillas, Puyol, Piqu\u00e9, Lucio, Maicon, \nIniesta, Xavi, Sneijder, Cristiano Ronaldo, Villa, Messi), he looks relaxed and nowhere near as nervous as he has on \nprevious occasions.\u2019\nSurprises aside, it seems that none of the other candi-\ndates or winners objects to Messi\u2019s prize. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, for example, explains: \u2018For me, Messi, Iniesta and Xavi are play-ers on another level. And when a player on another level \nsuch as Messi wins, everyone should respect it. It was very difficult to choose the best and I think that Mourinho deserves it just as much as Leo Messi. It\u2019s gold for Messi and disappointment \nfor Spain,\u2019 reads the As headline.\u2019 It later adds: \u2018Messi \nwithout Xavi and Iniesta is a lot less Messi.\u2019\n\u2018Two giants [Messi and Mourinho] and a Spanish boy-\ncott,\u2019 complains the cover of Marca.\u2019 Marca \nhas also launched a poll on its website: \u2018Was it fair for Messi to win the Ballon d\u2019Or.274 Messi\nBut it is not just the online voters and the Madrid sports \nmedia who are disappointed with FIFA. Messi has triumphed when he has played with Xavi and Iniesta, but he couldn\u2019t do it \nwithout them in Africa. The two of them, Xavi as much as Iniesta, don\u2019t just symbolise an attractive ideology \nabout the game the way that Messi does. Maybe questions need to be asked \nabout why Spain loses all the global sporting votes: the 2016 \nOlympics, the 2018 World Cup, the 2010 Ballon d\u2019Or \u2026 It\u2019s a well deserved prize for Messi but it\u2019s an undeserved indif-\nference towards Spanish football, a day Barcelona will not \nforget. And almost nobody agrees with the choice of Messi as winner. \u2018Messi. Turin Surprise  275\nnewspaper La Stampa writes that \u2018football has lost its way\u2019, \nsince \u2018Messi has not won any titles of late\u2019. Messi\u2019s 58 goals \nin the last season which helped Bar\u00e7a win their second con-\nsecutive Liga title and the Supercup against Seville seem to \ncount for very little, as does the Argentine\u2019s brilliant start to \nthe season (28 goals in 26 matches). How could \nDiego Milito, a key player in Inter Milan\u2019s Italian league win and Champions League win, not have made the list. (Later it transpires that if it hadn\u2019t been for the journalists\u2019 votes, Sneijder would \nhave been the winner, with Messi in fourth place.) In any \ncase, no one is expecting the Argentine to be on the win-ner\u2019s podium, everyone thinks it will be Iniesta, who scored \nthe goal which clinched Spain\u2019s first World Cup title. \u2018The undisputed number \none doesn\u2019t need a World Cup in order to win the prize,\u2019 276 Messi\ninsists Mundo Deportivo. \u2018Gold for Messi, glory for Bar\u00e7a,\u2019 \nreads the headline in Sport, emphasising that more than any \nindividual player, there is one clear winner: Barcelona. The \nonly dissenting opinion comes from weekly sports magazine \nDon Bal\u00f3n, which writes in its editorial: \u2018Few people doubt \nthat Messi is number one, but in 2010, Xavi \u2013 if Iniesta will excuse me \u2013 deserved to be recognised as the chosen one. \u2018Messi is the best once again,\u2019 says Clar\u00edn. \u2018The world worships Messi,\u2019 writes La Naci\u00f3n. \u2018Messi \nis pure gold,\u2019 claims P\u00e1gina 12. I \nwouldn\u2019t have been able to bear it if Messi hadn\u2019t won. \u2018Xavi always looks like he\u2019s in con-\ntrol, he plays with authority, but it\u2019s Messi who scores the \ngoals. Yes, Iniesta scored in the World Cup final, he\u2019s a great player, fantastic, talented. But \nout of those three, I would choose Messi ten times over.\u2019 \nAnd when asked about the Spaniards\u2019 annoyance regard-ing Messi\u2019s triumph, the Pelusa replies: \u2018They might be \nthe champions of the world, but we have the best player in  \nthe world. \u2018How \ncan anyone say they\u2019ve been robbed by Messi. Messi  \ngives us so much,\u2019 declares the Barcelona manager. He makes La Liga better and more respected.\u2019\nDespite having two such heavyweight advocates in his \ncorner, Messi still has to speak out and explain to one and all that he has no reason to justify himself because has not \n\u2018robbed\u2019 anyone of anything, and he has done enough to \nmerit lifting the trophy.\u2019278 Messi\nRegarding his team-mates, he says: \u2018There is no jealousy \nbetween us.

At the end of the \nday, the prize has stayed in the family once again, with Bar\u00e7a and with La Masia \u2013 our youth academy.

Messi\u2019s 58 goals \nin the last season which helped Bar\u00e7a win their second con-\nsecutive Liga title and the Supercup against Seville seem to \ncount for very little, as does the Argentine\u2019s brilliant start to \nthe season (28 goals in 26 matches). How could \nDiego Milito, a key player in Inter Milan\u2019s Italian league win and Champions League win, not have made the list.\u2019 (The year in which Italy beat Spain.)\nBut in Barcelona they disagree. \u2018The undisputed number \none doesn\u2019t need a World Cup in order to win the prize,\u2019 276 Messi\ninsists Mundo Deportivo. \u2018Gold for Messi, glory for Bar\u00e7a,\u2019 \nreads the headline in Sport, emphasising that more than any \nindividual player, there is one clear winner: Barcelona.\u2019 \nAnd when asked about the Spaniards\u2019 annoyance regard-ing Messi\u2019s triumph, the Pelusa replies: \u2018They might be \nthe champions of the world, but we have the best player in  \nthe world. \u2018How \ncan anyone say they\u2019ve been robbed by Messi. Messi  \ngives us so much,\u2019 declares the Barcelona manager. He makes La Liga better and more respected. Spain is the \nworld champion, and they were represented by six players in the \u201cbest eleven of the year\u201d.
