But the first person to 'bowl' to Sachin\nwas his nanny. I was the first\nbowler he faced in his life,' the 68-year-old recalled in an interview to\nthe Vlleek (29 November 1998).\nFor 11 years Sachin was under the care ofLaxmibai at the writers'\ncooperative housing society of Sahitya Sahawas (roughly translated,\nthe 'community oflitterateurs') in the middle-class suburb ofBandra\n(East). Sachin was born on 24 April\n1973, 11 years after brother Ajit; sister Savita and brother Nitin were\nthe older siblings. Coincidentally, music would\nbe one of the adult Sachin's three passions, the other two being cricket\nand his family. The very year Sachin was born, the cricket-mad city ofMumbai\nfor the first time had the privilege ofwatching a Test match live on TV. Sachin had reached\n'double figures' just two months before that epochal victory and was\npart of the new generation of youngsters fired by one oflndia' s greatest\nsporting achievements.\nSachin,judging from the memories ofhis childhood friends, was\na hyperactive child. Today\nRamesh is personal assistant to Ajit and Sachin. This for Sachin and his close\nBombay Boy\n\n5\n\n\fcompanions constituted the great outdoors.\nHis brother Ajit recalls Sachin as a restless child who could never\nstay in one spot for long and was always running around. The most abiding memory of those\nchildhood days appears to be Sachin's strength and his fondness for\n'fights'. Whenever there was a new boy in the housing society or\nschool, Sachin would challenge him physically.\nBy the time he reached the second grade, Sachin had achieved the\nnot inconsiderable feat for a six-year-old of beating up another boy all\nof two years older than him.'\nSachin's first sporting hero, though, was not a cricketer; it was\ntennis superstar John McEnroe. But Sachin was rooting for the\nyounger man. Fortunately for Indian cricket, the fling with tennis did\nnot last, and before long Sachin had made it to the Sahitya Sahawas\n'big boys' cricket team.\nBy the time he was 11, Sachin's obsession with cricket had begun.\nSachin's uncle and aunt, Suresh and Mangala Tendulkar, lived just\nacross the road from the park. Sachin would finish school\n(Sharadashram English, very close to Shivaji Park) in the morning\nand then go to his uncle's for lunch and a rest before crossing to\nShivaji Park for afternoon practice from 3 p.\nIt was his brother Ajit who first spotted Sachin's natural talent.\nWhile Sachin imitated his heroes in other sports (notably, McEnroe),\nwhere cricket was concerned, he had a style of his own.\nIndian cricket-indeed, the world of sports-owes a huge debt to Ajit\nTendulkar, for it was he who set the first small steps in motion. Indeed, there\nhave been occasions when Sachin Tendulkar was the sole\nrepresentative in the Test side from the city that boasts the proudest\ncricket tradition in the land. Before that Mumbai remained unbeaten from 1958-59\nto 1972-73, a golden streakof15 years unprecedented in the history of\nfirst-class cricket. And the\nnames ofMumbai's great batsmen read like an honour scroll oflndian\ncricket-Vijay Merchant, Rusi Modi, Polly Umrigar, Nari Contractor,\nVijay Manjrekar, Dilip Sardesai, Ajit Wadekar, Sunil Gavaskar,\nSandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, down to the present generation of\nPravinAmre, Vinod Kambli and quite possibly the finest of them all,\nSachin Tendulkar.

Another player, wicketkeeper\nMehli Dinshaw Irani who played in the Ranji Trophy, also turned out\nfor his side (Parsi Cyclists) for more than 50 years. In the same article in Sunday Mid Day, he recollects,\nI0\n\nSachin\n\n\f'Several years ago, I was standing at square leg, umpiring a game at\nAzad Maidan.\n\n12\n\nSachin\n.", "Sachin_1985": "He was a natural cricketer. When\nSachin was growing up, the school scene was dominated by the likes\nofSharadashram Vidyamandir, Balamohan, St. The coach, already well known in Mumbai cricket\ncircles, and soon to become a legend in the cricket world, agreed after\nfirst confirming that 11-year-old Sachin had never played with a hard\ncricket ball.\nOn the first day; Achrekar told Sachin to watch in order to get a feel\nof what playing with the 'big boys' would be like. 'For the first and so\nfar perhaps the only time in his cricket career, Sachinjust stood and\nwatched the others play,' remembers Ajit.\nOnce the batting was over Sachin did, however, get a chance to be\npart of the fielding drill. He was a natural cricketer.'\nOn the way home from that first session, Sachin told his brother\n14\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith the same confidence with which he would handle the world's\nbest bowlers, 'I can bat better than any of them. Playing with a rubber ball meant Sachin resorted\nto cross-bat shots to cope with the exaggerated bounce. He did, however, have a problem with Sachin's\nbatting grip, something he had acquired as a five-year-old when he\nplayed around with 1\\jit's bat. In order to grip a bat that was obviously\ntoo big for him, Sachin clutched it at the bottom of the handle, and the\nhabit stuck. But Sachin felt uncomfortable with this new grip and\nfinally, Achrekar relented.\nSpeaking to me late in 2001, Bishan Singh Bedi narrated an\nincident that occurred in New Zealand in 1990, during Sachin's\nsecond tour. But I\nrefused, as this was what had brought so many runs for Sachin at such\na young age. He had fixed Sachin's place as number four in the\nbatting line-up. (So would his\nfirst two One-day Internationals [oms] in 1989.) But those early\nfailures did not faze Sachin one bit.\n1\\jit remembers scores of 51,38 and 45 (a batsman had to retire after\nreaching 50), though the diary in which Sachin noted his scores has\nsince been lost.\nSachin started school in the Indian Education Society's New\nEnglish School, close to the family home in Bandra (East) where\nmost of his friends also studied. Till now Sachin had played cricket only during\nthe school vacations.\nThe final decision was left to Sachin himself-a tough one for a\nboy so young. Ajit remembers that Sachin in his childlike excitement picked out the first bat he saw, one that appeared too\nbig and heavy for him.\nBy now Sachin's life revolved around cricket and cricket alone. Achrekar did not want to risk his star ward on\n16\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe treacherous pitches where the ball would get up to all kinds of\ntricks, mostly of the dangerous variety. But those four months helped\nSachin forge what would become one of his closest friendships: with\nVinod Kambli.\nSachin made his debut in 1984 in the Giles under-15 tournament\nfor Sharadashram English (he was a reserve in the Harris under-17)\nagainst Khoja Khan High School at the Navroze Cricket Club ground\non Azad Maidan; he was 11 and a half years old. But Sachin's timing was so\ngood that he was able to find the gaps in the field, allowing the ball to\nrace to the boundary.\nThe first person to predict success for Sachin was an umpire by the\nname of Gondhalekar. He was umpiring the quarter-finals against\nDon Bosco at Cross Maidan in which Sachin smashed ten fours in a\nknock of 50. The umpire predicted toAchrekar that the lad would one\nday play for the country-a prediction Achrekar brushed aside since\nthis was Sachin's first year in competitive cricket.\nAchrekar was keen that Sachin get a place in the Bombay Cricket\nAssociation (BCA) nets for under-19 boys which were spread across\nthe city and were usually conducted by an ex-Test cricketer.\nAjit took Sachin to the MIG (Middle Income Group) Cricket Club\nground, a short walk from their home in Bandra, to meet the coach in\ncharge, a man named Dandekar. But Dandekarwas shocked when he\nheard Sachin was only 12, and bluntly told Ajit his kid brother was too\nyoung to get into the under-19 nets. Sessions intense enough for Sachin\nto say goodbye to a normal childhood with summer vacations filled\nwith childhood pranks and fun and games. The move was triggered by the events of one summer\nafternoon when Sachin and his friends were playing outside the house\nwhile the family watched the Hindi film Guide on television. The next day his brother and father\nsent him for coaching and his career in cricket started.\nYears later, Sachin would list the names of his uncle and aunt, with\nthose of Ajit and his father, as his greatest influences.\nAll through this year of1985, it was cricket, cricket and more cricket. Even after he broke into\ninternational cricket, Sachin was known to talk--cricket, of course land walk in his sleep. Bowling was a fascination with Sachin from the\nearly days and even then he bowled an assortment of medium pace\nand leg spin.\nIfhe got out early, Achrekar would take him across town on his scooter\nto the Azad Maidan where his Sassanian Cricket Club was playing,\nand Sachin would get to bat twice during the day.\nAt the age of12, Sachin played his first match in the Kanga League,\nscoring five for the Young Parsee Cricket Club in the 'F' division. The season began in right earnest in\nOctober and this time Sachin played for another of Achrekar's clubs:\nHind Sevak Cricket Club in the Gordhandas Shield, open only to\nclubs in the suburbs ofMumbai. The team won the tournament with\n18\n\nSachin\n\n\fSachin scoring 30 in his first game and 43 in the semi-finals, against\nexperienced bowlers with '. Sachin was unbeaten on\n96 at the end of the first day of the three-day match, coming in after\nthe loss of two wickets.\nEarly on the second day, one of the rival team's pace bowlers was\nsquare-cut to the boundary and Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar's first\ncentury entered the record books.\nSachin was then chosen for the Mumbai under-15 team for the\nVijay Merchant inter-zonal tournament to be played in Pune. Former Ranji Trophy captain Milind\nRege, who was also a junior selector, assured Ajit that Sachin had the\npotential to go all the way. The 1985-86 season had turned out to be a\nnotable one for Sachin.\nHe played a full season ofKanga League cricket in 1986-87 for the\n'F' division team of the John Bright Cricket Club. But the very first time Sachin's photograph appeared\nin the papers was when he scored 123 against Maharashtra in just 140\nminutes, in the opening game at Baroda. West Zone lost to holders South Zone with Sachin's\n74 run-out being the highest score. Just one rung lower,\nin the Giles Shield, Sachin had been appointed captain. Sachin\nconfidently predicted he would win not only the match, but the title\nas well. And so was Sachin. Sachin scored 42 and 150\nnot out in his side's victory and finished his Harris season with 596\nruns in five innings. Captaining his school in the Giles, Sachin\nsmashed 197 in the semi-finals, and then it was time for the final\nagainst Don Bosco, Matunga. Sharadashram English achieved the Harris/Giles double that\nyear, largely due to Sachin's huge scores.\n20\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe distinction ofbeing the first journalist to interview the prodigy\nright after the 'double' fell to Sunil Warrier ofMid Day. He has vivid memories of the meeting, claiming\nwith a laugh: 'I made Sachin famous and then he made me famous.'\n'Sachin was making runs by the tons. As we started\nchatting I realized that Sachin was keeping mum and f\\jit was doing\nall the talking. Every time I asked a question, Sachin would prompt\nhis brother in Marathi, \"Tu sang na\" (You tell him). I did\nmeet Sachin subsequently when he scored debut hundreds in the\nRanji Trophy and Irani Trophy. But I was weaned away from cricket\nto hockey and football and I never met Sachin again.'\nWarrier's interview mentioned that Sunil Gavaskar and Vivian\nRichards were Sachin's favourite batsmen, something he maintains\nto this day.'\nThere were so many tournaments to play and Sachin did not want\nto miss any of them-the Cosmopolitan Shield, the Bombay Junior\nCricket tournament, the Mahim-Dadar Shield and the Gordhandas\nShield, as well as a few matches for the BCA Colts.\nSachin had scored twice as many runs as any other school cricketer\nand was the only batsman to have scored a hundred for Mumbai in\nthe Vijay Merchant Trophy. He had been prolific\nin club cricket against senior bowlers.'\nEven while scoring a mountain of runs, Sachin did not neglect his\nbowling and picked up quite a few wickets with his medium-pacers.\nSachin was not selected for the Academy.\nThe 1987-88 season was a turning point in Sachin's fledgling career. Sure enough, at the age of 14,\nSachin became the youngest player ever selected for Mumbai in the\nWest Zone Ranji Trophy league. Sachin's scores\nof 158, 97 and 75 won him the Man of the Series award and rook his\n22\n\nSachin\n\n\fteam (Dattu Phadkar XI) to victory.\nOn 14 November 1987, the Mumbai Ranji Trophy selection panel\nof Ajit Wadekar, Sudhir Naik, Bapu Nadkarni and Sandeep Patil\nannounced the names of36 probables. Sachin's name was on the list.\nSachin was in the reserves for the opening West Zone league tie\nagainst Baroda on 19 December. But he failed to\ngain selection to the Indian team for the under-19 World Cup in\nAustralia.", "Sachin_1988": "World Record\n\nHe is a sure betfor India in afew years' time.- Raj Singh Dungarpur\n\nThe Harris Shield semi-final against St. Xavier's, Fort (Sunil\nGavaskar's old school) was played at the Sassanian Cricket Club\nground on Azad Maidan on 23-25 February 1988, and it was this\nmatch that propelled Sachin into the world record books for the first\ntime.\nSachin won the toss and took first strike. Opening bowler Sanghani\npicked up the wickets of openers Atul Ranade (42) and R.Mulye (18)\nand the score was 84 for 2 when Sachin joined Vi nod, who had by\nthen reached 29. At the end of the first day's play, Vinod was batting on\n182 and Sachin on 192. Chavan spoke to Achrekar who told him to pass on\ninstructions to Sachin to declare and give enough time for his bowlers\nto dismiss St. Sachin kept telling me not to look at\nhim.\nFinally, a stern warning over the phone during the lunch break\nforced Sachin to declare at 7 48 for 2.'\nPerhaps for the first time, Sachin got a ticking offfrom his coach.\nWhile Sachin was not a new name for Mumbai cricket followers,\nhe was for most of us in the rest of the country. Sachin\nwon the toss and decided to bat. By close, Sachin was batting on 122. The local press had by now latched on to the fact that there was\na real talent in their midst and most papers carried Sachin's photograph\nthe next morning. Sharadashram added 79 runs before being all out\non the third morning, Sachin's share being 60 to stay unbeaten on\n346-his second consecutive unbeaten triple century in the\ntournament.\nStraight after the rigours ofhis triple ton, Sachin came on to bowl22\novers of medium pace on the trot. The match ended with Anjuman\non 269 for 8 with Sachin having claimed four wickets in 52 overs (28\nmaidens).\n26\n\nSachin\n\n\fThus, often I wonder what I would have been had there been\nno Harris Shield tournament.\nSachin was still in school when Raj Singh Dungarpur, one of the\ndoyens of Mumbai cricket and the president of the Cricket Club of\nIndia (cCI), took the initiative to make Sachin a member of the\nprestigious club, whose home is the Brabourne Stadium. The club\nchanged its rules to allow Sachin to play for them in the Kanga League. Sachin was just 14.\nIn an article on Tendulkar by Scyld Berry (Wtsden Cricket Monthly,\nJune 1996), Raj Singh-then chairman of the national selection\ncommittee-looked back eight years on Sachin's innings in the Harris\nShield final of April 1988.' Raj Singh was also quoted in a more contemporary profile\nWorld Record\n\n27\n\n\fofSachin by Shirish Nadkarni soon after his school and early Ranji\ntrophy feats, in the Cricketer International (April1989). For Sachin would make his\ninternational debut in November 1989.\n\n28\n\nSachin\n.", "Sachin_1989": "-Naren Tamhane\nRaj Singh Dungarpur, with his eye for talent, played a major role in\nthe formative stages of Sachin's cricketing career. The former\nRajasthan medium-pacer (and erstwhile royalty) arranged for a\nsponsor (the Birla Trust) to enable Sachin to go on his first tour abroad,\nto England with the Star Cricket Club. Future Test cricketers Vi nod Kambli and Sameer\nDighe were also in the squad. In the first match against Indian\nGymkhana, Sachin scored 49.\nSachin was back in the UK the following year with Star, and this\ntime he scored his first century on foreign soil. The team had a few first-class\ncricketers from Sussex in the side, as well as future South Mrican Test\n\n\fpace bowler Meyrick Pringle. There was nearly another century for\nSachin, against Horsham Cricket Club, and this time his 94 came off\n75 deliveries.\nThe two trips gave Sachin valuable exposure to the variable pitches\nand the changing weather patterns in England.\nMter returning to Mumbai with the Star team in 1988, it was time\nfor Sachin to play for the CCI in the first division of the Kanga League. The\nsecretary of the CCI cricket committee and former Mumbai Ranji\nTrophy captain Milind Rege was suitably impressed by the way Sachin\nplayed-like a 'grown-up man'-getting on top of the ball even on a\ndrying track.\nThere was just one more taste ofjunior cricket before Sachin made\nhis first-class debut.\nThere was little doubt now that Sachin would make his Ranji Trophy\ndebut in the season's opening West Zone league game at the Wankhede\nStadium against Gujarat. The selection committee ofNaren Tamhane, Milind Rege,\nSudhir Naik and Ajit Wadekar were suitably impressed, for Sachin\nscored 55 in the first game and 54 in the second, with nine boundaries.\nYears later, Sachin would recall how he irritated Kulkarni by batting\nwithout a helmet.\nRege- wrote in Sportsweek, We decided to induct Sachin in the\nBombay Ranji XI at his usual number four position. Every member\n30\n\nSachin\n\n\fin the team was delighted with the way Sachin batted.'\nDilip Vengsarkar was captain of both the Mumbai Ranji Trophy\nteam and the national team at the time. He had never seen Sachin bat\nand needed to be convinced that this boy, who was just 15 and barely\nfive feet two inches tall, could stand up to adults. But\nseeing Sachin play him confidently, he stepped up the pace and even\nslipped in a few bouncers. Sachin was unfazed and stood up to him\nwithout flinching.\nThe experience of facing Kapil left a lasting impression on Sachin.\nSachin's debut match was played on 10-12 December 1988 and\nwas the opening match in the Talim Shield, symbol of supremacy in\nthe Ranji 11\u00b7ophy West Zone division. Pathak bowled by Kasliwal from the first ball of the match. But the spectators had\ncome for one thing only-to watch Sachin bat. With the interval\nbarely 15 minutes away, Rajput going for a third run was run out for\n99 at 206 for 2, and Sachin made his way to the crease, heralded by\nrapturous applause.\nSeven deliveries later, Sachin faced his first ball in first-class cricket,\nbowled by off-spinner N isarg Patel. The batsman defended. Sachin's first\nscoring stroke in first-class cricket was a boundary. At lunch Sachin was on ten. Between lunch and\ntea his score progressed to the 80s with a full range of attacking strokes\nas Mumbai strove for quick runs and bonus batting points. Together,\nSachin and Sippy added 145 runs to the score, then the left-bander\ndeparted for 127, bowled by left-arm spinner Joy Zinto, and Mumbai\nwere 361 for 3. Sachin was joined by another\ndebutant, Sameer Talpade, by which time he had progressed to 95. Sachin obliged, the shot\nleaving the fielders rooted as he raced to 99. Sachin\n32\n\nSachin\n\n\fwent on the front foot and with a neat turn of the wrists to backward\nsquare leg, he got the vital run. The crowd rose as Sachin returned to\nthe pavilion, unbeaten on 100.\nAt 15 years, 7 months and 17 days, Sachin Tendulkar entered the\nrecord books as the youngest Indian to score a century on first-class\ndebut. The match was drawn as Gujarat scored 306 in their second\ninnings and Mumbai finished on 43 for 2, with Sachin not batting a\nsecond time. Against Bandra Urdu High School, Sachin's 191 runs were\nscored in a mere two hours. Raj put and Sippy were both\nout for a duck in the very first over bowled by left-arm medium-pacer\nRajesh Jadeja. Unlike in his debut match, this time there was the\npressure of a scoreboard reading 0 for 2 when Sachin came to the\ncrease to join opener Hattangadi. Saurashtra gained the rare honour of taking the first innings\nlead as they scored 297.\nIn the second innings Sachin came in at number three with the\nscore reading 77 and this time played 120 deliveries for his innings\ntop score of89 with seven boundaries, the same as in the first innings.\nFollowing his first two matches, a remarkable article on Sachin by\nMumbai journalist Shirish Nadkarni appeared in the Cricketer\nInternational (April 1989). [Sachin] is already being talked about as being better than\nGavaskar was at the same age. Mter all, Gavaskar was not called up for\nRanji duty until he was out of his teens, whereas Sachin will only\ncelebrate his sixteenth birthday on 24 April1989. Until this point the\ncomparison runs very much in his favour, but otherwise it is invidious,\nsince Sachin is basically an attacking batsman whereas Sunny was a\nmaster of classical defensive technique.'\nEven after making a mark at the first-class level, Sachin continued\nto play for his school and age-specific tournaments, treating all matches\nwith equal importance. But there was no dislodging Sachin from\nthe team. Baroda were led by Anshuman Gadcwad with wicketkeeper\nKiran More and left-arm medium-pacer Rashid Patel (all with Test\nexperience) also in the side. This would be Sachin's most formidable\nopposition to date.\nBaroda batted first and scored 313. Mumbai lost openers Rajput\nand Hattangadi with only 20 on the board, and Sachin came in ahead\nofVengsarkar who was nursing an injured right knee. Sachin quickly hit them\nboth for boundaries. Mumhai gained a\nlead of 19 runs and the match was drawn, with Sachin not batting in\n34\n\nSachin\n\n\fa second innings total of 5 for 1.\nThe Indian under-19 team was to tour Pakistan for the first time and\nSachin was a certainty. He scored 63 in the trial match and also had a\ndouble century and a century in the under-19 Coach Behar Trophy. Sachin\ndid pass his exams but from then on, all further tests would be on the\ncricket field. Tendulkar scored 81 and four not out in\nA Boy Among M-en\n\n35\n\n\fthe drawn match and Maharashtra finished on top of the West Zone\nleague with 55 points. Remarkably, for a 15-year-old in a team full of\ninternational stars, Sachin topped the Mumbai batting in the league\nphase with 349 runs at an average of87. One fascinated viewer of\nSachin's 81 was Sandeep Bamzai who wrote about it in his book\nGavaskar and Tendulkar: Shaping Indian Cricket's Destiny:\nAnkola tried to intimidate the little fella (Sachin), but he took a\nheavy toll of the wayward bowling. But Sachin had already become a major crowdpuller and there must have been close to 10,000 spectators-an\nunusually large crowd for a Ranji Trophy match, even one with so\nmany Test players in both sides. The pitch was a typical turner and the\nspinners played a leading role from the very first session of the first\n36\n\nSachin\n\n\fday Hyderabad had three spinners of note: Venkatapathy Raju (leftarm), Arshad Ayub (off spin) and M.

But\nSachin matched his skipper stroke for stroke as they added 118 runs to\ntake Mumbai out of the woods and eventually to a narrow first innings\nlead. Sachin's 59 came in 145 minutes and contained 7 fours. Sachin was\ndismissed for just seven by Test off-spinner Gopal Sharma who had\nthe. There was\nA Boy Among Men\n\n37\n\n\fanother half-century by Sachin, his 75 taking four minutes short of\nfour hours, his longest stint at the crease so far. Manu Nayyar (105) and Prabhakar (123)\nput on 232 for the opening wicket. Tendulkar got his first chance to\nbowl in first-class cricket (4-0-12-0; 9-2-20-0) and also took his first\ncatch (Manoj Prabhakar for 11 off Nayak's bowling in the second\ninnings). But it was Sachin who took the\nhonours and top-scored with 78. Sachin was lastman out and Mumbai\nwere dismissed for 321. But it was Sachin's 78 that caught his\neye.\n'He was so good, so compact at the age of 15 and a half, it was\n]8\n\nSachin\n\n\ftremendous.77, with one century and six 50s) it had been deCided\nthat Sachin was too raw to be chosen for the Indian team on their tour\nofthe mighty West Indies.\n'But we decided to wait till until the tour of Pakistan [later in 1989] . Not that Sachin himself thought so.\nJust before the team to the West Indies was announced, actorjournalist Tom Alter interviewed Sachin for a sports video (Sports\nChannel).\nSachin: Ifl get selected I will go.\nSachin: I will try my best to face them.\nThirdly, when asked whether he grew tired of batting while\nwith Kambli in that mammoth partnership, Sachin's reply was\nan almost unbelievable shake of the head. And fourthly, Sachin\nmade it very clear that being compared to Gavaskar was a bit\nembarrassing to him, and that he simply wanted to play his\nown, 'natural' game.\nThe 1989-90 season kicked off in Mumbai with the Irani Trophy\nmatch between Ranji Trophy champions Delhi and the Rest oflndia\nA Boy Among Men\n\n39\n\n\ffor whom Sachin was an automatic choice. It was played on 3-7\nNovember 1989 and was a virtual selection trial for the tour to Pakistan\nstarting later that month.\nDelhi piled up 461 and by close on the second day, Rest were 79 for\n3 with Rajput, Surendra Bhave and Manjrekar the batsmen back in\nthe pavilion. When Gursharan\nSingh was out for 31 on the third morning, Sachin joined\nnightwatchman Syed Saba Karim with the total on 119 for 4. Sachin\npunished the medium pace ofSanjeev Sharma and Atul Wassan, but\nwas troubled by Maninder's accurate left-arm spin. After playing himself in, Sachin on-drove and then\nstraight drove Wassan to the boundary. Captain Madan Lal replaced\nWassan with Sharma who was promptly smashed for four, followed\nby a square cut off Maninder that went racing to the boundary for\nSachin's fourth four. As Sachin\ndefended on the front foot, the ball went off the middle of the bat,\ndropped to the ground and spun on to the stumps to bowl him for a\ncrisply struck 39.\nBut it did give Sachin another crack at the record books.\nIncidentally, during the meeting to select the team for Pakistan,\nthe view was expressed that Sachin might be a failure.\n40\n\nSachin\n\n\fSachin went in with the score at 76 for 2 and as if to celebrate the\nnews ofhis selection, went for the Delhi bowlers. By now, it was virtually Sachin v Delhi as wickeb\ntumbled at the other end.'\nSachin raced to 50 from just 66 balls, with seven fours, and was\nrapidly running out of partners. Sachin tried to\nretain the strike as much as possible. But at 180 for 8,\nVenkatapathy Raju came otlt in the form of the last man as Gursharan\nSingh had fractured a finger on his right hand while batting. Raju was\nout at 209 with Sachin atill 11 runs short of the magic three-figure\nmark. By this time Raj Singh had told Gursharan to pad up and stay\nwith Sachin till he got his c-entury. Batting courageously\nwith one hand, Gursharan faced 16 deliveries, finally retiring hurt on\nfive when Sachin cover drove Maninder for his fourteenth boundary\nto go from 99 to 103. The Rest innings was terminated at 245 and\nSachin had registered his second century in eight first-class matches. At 16 years and 197 days, Sachin had added another\n'youngest' record to his collection-the youngest to score a century in\nthe Irani Trophy, that too on debut. Certainly, the pay dispute was\nan unfortunate prologue to Sachin's bow in international cricket. The next day was the\n'\nonly first-class\nfixture before the start of the first Test: a three-day\ngame against the Cricket Board Patron's XI at Rawalpindi where\nSachin made his first appearance in national colours. Sachin's\ncontribution was a useful47 before he was stumped offleft-arm spinner\nIqbal Qasim. His performance removed any lingering doubt over his\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n43\n\n\finclusion in the first Test at the National Stadium, Karachi starting\non 15 November 1989. At 16\nyears and 205 days, Sachin became the youngest Indian Test player\nand the fourth youngest of all time. Before him, only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had\nplayed as many matches for India.\nAs far as the age record is concerned, three Pakistanis-Mushtaq\nMohammad, Aaqib Javed and Aftab Baloch-were all listed at the\ntime as being younger than Sachin on debut. Unofficially at least, this made Sachin\nthe youngest in history\u00b7 to play Test cricket. Sachin\nadmitted as much in an interview to Sebastian Coe of Daily Telegraph\n(May 2001): 'I remember walking into the changing room and\nwondering how I would cope with all the famous names around me\nand they were all about twice my age.'\n_\nSrikkanth won the toss in his first Test as captain and put Pakistan\nin. India had immediate success when Kapil Dev dismissed Aamir\n44\n\nSachin\n\n\fMalik for a duck with four runs on the board. Shoaib Mohammad had shored up the batting with\n67. Unfortunately, Sachin's first day in Test cricket was marred by a\nspectator running on to the field and attacking the Indian captain after\nfirst menacing Kapil.' (Mid Day, 24 May\n2001)\nAzhar was lbw to Imran, and India were staring the follow-on\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n45\n\n\fsquare in the face at 85 for 6. Shoaib's 95\nand Salim Malik's unbeaten 102 helped Imran declare at 305 for 5\nand set India the highly improbable task of scoring 453 in a minim urn\nof102 overs. Sachin curbed his natural attacking instincts and batted\n46\n\nSachin\n\n\ffor 150 minutes, perhaps remembering the sound advice given by\nShastri after his dismissal in the first Test. The partnership was extended\nto 143 the next day and Sachin got his maiden Test half-century in\nonly his second innings. Sachin had batted for 244 minutes and 165\nballs and hit four fours when lmran, bowling at his best in the series so\nfar, had him beaten comprehensively and got him plumb in front for\n59.\nIndia's total of288 appeared inadequate and Pakistan piled up 423\nfor 9 declared, with opener Aamir Malik recording his first century.\nSachin took his first catch-Akram caught for 28 offPrabhakar. Azhar marked his return to form with a\nstreaky 109 (his first century outside India) while Sidhu, Manjrekar\nand Prabhakar all scored half-centuries as India finished on 398 for 7. Sachin (8) was one such victim,\nrooted a couple ofyards outside his crease, uncertain whether to respond\ntoAzhar's call for a single when he was on 99.\nSachin scored 41 before being bowled by Qadir. Manjrekar, following\nhis Lahore double-ton, was once again top scorer in the first innings,\nwith 72. All the batsmen except numbers 10 and 11 reached double\nfigures, with Sachin contributing 35. India took the lead for the first\ntime in the series (and only for the second time in 20 Tests in Pakistan)\nas Pakistan crumbled to 250with medium-pacer Vivek Razdan---one\nof Sachin's confidants on the tour-picking up 5 for 79 in only his\nsecond Test.\nThis brought out the best in Sidhu and Tendulkar and they took the\nscore to 104without further loss at the close of the fourth day, with the\nopener on 54 and Sachin on 33. But Sachin stood up to everything they could fling at\nhim and even inspired his senior partner. The next delivery, swinging and full pitched, was\n48\n\nSachin\n\n\fgloriously square driven for four.\nNo one after that would ever doubt Sachin's value to the Indian\ncause. Sidhu went on to 97\nand India were 234 for 7 when the match was called off.\nSachin in an interview to Sportsworld Qanuary 1996) was to look\nback at that incident as one that added aggression to his armoury.Mohan wrote in the\nSportstar (30 December 1989) under the headline 'The Wonder Boy Is\nHere to Stay': 'The gut feeling is that Sachin Tendulkar will go places.'\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n49\n\n\fThe Indian team had emerged with honour intact in the Test series. And how he made the\nmost of that opportunity is now part of the Sachin legend. Srikkanth had\ndropped himself down the order and appeared to have given up the\nghost when he was joined at the crease by Sachin. It all started in leg-spinner Mush tag\nAhmed's second (and final) over in which he was smashed for 16 runs\nby Sachin: two sixes and a four.\n'Let me see if you can hit my bowling the same way,' Qadir said to\nSachin after Mushtaq's over.\nSachin replied, 'You are such a great bowler, you will not allow me\nto do that. Three balls in a row were dispatched\n50\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith power and timing over the ropes. The over produced an astonishing 27\nruns as Sachin reached his 50 from 18 balls.\n'I did say in 1989 that Tendulkar will be a great batsman. Tendulkar\nwas also there. By that time he had made his name in the cricketing\nworld. Tendulkar\nis certainly one of those players.'\nIn the first official One-day International at Gujranwala on 18\nDecember, Sachin was out for his first duck in international cricket,\ncaught Akram bowled Younis first ball.\n\n52\n\nSachin\n.", "Sachin_1990": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nA month later, the Indian team were in New Zealand under a new\ncaptain, Mohammad Azharuddin, and a new coach, Bishan Singh\nBedi.\nHadlee was arguably the best bowler in the world at the time and\nfacing him at such an early stage of his career was an education for\nSachin. W V Raman was out to Hadlee off the first ball\nof the match and it was Prabhakar (95) and Manjrekar (42) who did\nthe early repair work, adding 92 for the second wicket. Azharuddin\nchipped in with 33 and his departure brought Tendulkar in at 152 for\n4.h Vengsarkar and Kapil came and went cheaply, and when\nwicketkeeper Kiran More joined Sachin at the crease, the score read\n218 for 6. By the close of the third day India were 348\nfor 7 and Tendulkar had batted five hours for his unbeaten 80. Sachin was still two months shy ofhis seventeenth birthday.\nA teammate, unnamed by Sachin, perhaps added to the pressure\nwhen he told the not-out batsman that he was 20 runs short ofhistory\nas he returned to the dressing room that evening.\nThe next morning, the first ball of the day from Danny Morrison\nwas dispatched to the cover boundary and then Sachin ran four runs\nto a shot to deep mid-off as he moved quickly to 88.

(Sports Channel video,\nDecember 1990)\n'I had two feelings when I caught him,' recalls Wright, now coach\nof the Indian team. 'Firstly one of relief, as at the time I was captain of\nNew Zealand and he was batting so beautifully we looked like we\n54\n\nSachin\n\n\fwould never get him out. My second feeling was one of almost feeling sorry for him as he\nwas only a lad really and he had batted so well and deserved a century.'\n'[Sachin's innings] left experienced members of the New Zealand\nteam agog,' wrote Don Neely, the convenor of the New Zealand\nselection panel, in the New Zealand CricketAlmanack (1991 ).\nHe was dropped for the next match against Australia but in the one\nafter that, against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on 6 March, he\nscored an attractive 36 from 39 balls, with five fours, as India won by\none run. It was a disappointing tournament for both\nSachin and the team as India lost both its league matches, to Sri Lanka\nand Pakistd. Sachin\nscored 10 (run out) and 20 in the two games.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of 1990.\nWith the first Texaco series om on 18 July, Sachin ran into form\nand followed the unbeaten half-century against Hampshire with\nscores of92 and 70 (v Kent); 65 (v Minor Counties); and 10 not out (v\nScotland).\n\n\fSachin's knocks of 92 and 70 against Kent at Canterbury were\nsignificant as they were the first for him in the role of opener. Regulars\nNavjot Sidhu and WV Raman were indisposed and Sachin opened\nwith wicketkeeper Kiran More in a makeshift arrangement. According\nto manager and former Test stumper Madhav Mantri, Sachin had\nvolunteered for the slot, keeping the team's interests in mind.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47. His 179 was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n60\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. Sachin was too young to vote, too young\nto drink alcohol, too young to sign his contract with the Board which\nhis father had done for him less than 12 months ago.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October 1990). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over 30 books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n62\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred.

Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his 20s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries.

His appointment was confirmed only till the first Test in\nKolkata in january 1993. Sachin stayed unbeaten on a rapid 82 and was\non hand to congratulate his friend.\n\n\fKambli was quick to give credit to Tendulkar while receiving the\nMan of the Match award. 'I will never forget Sachin's birthday gift to me,' were his\nwords. With just a handful of runs\nneeded for the win after England had followed on, Sachin and Vi nod\nwere at the crease when India wrapped things up before lunch on the\nfifth day. In February 1993, Chepauk was witness to\nTendulkar's first century at home and his fifth overall. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. In 1998, an outstanding innings against Australia saw Sachin\nmaster Shane Warne at Chepauk. But there was heartbreak in 1999:\nanother masterly ton took India to the doorstep of victory against\nPakistan before Sachin's back gave way and India fell just short. Three\nyears later, in March 2001, Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series 2-1. There were a couple of incidents on the field\nduring this match which showed Sachin's versatility. Paul\nJarvis flicked Kumble hard and low in the second innings, only to be\ngobbled up at short leg by Sachin, an outstanding catch at ankle height\nfrom a legitimate shot. A new\nrecord total by India at home, and another innings victory. He joined a band of 25 others whose first three-figure knocks\n104\n\nSachin\n\n\fwere over 200, among them two legendary left-banders, Garry Sobers\nand Brian Lara.\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests: 236 not out by Sunil Gavaskar. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India. Still two\nmonths shy of his twentieth birthday, Sachin appeared comfortable in\na rule he was handling for the first time, and termed the experience\n'interesting'.Visvanath\nSuccess at Home and Abroad\n\n105\n\n\fdenied that Sachin was being groomed for captaincy. 'Basically Sachin\nis a very, very mature cricketer.\nThe first step was taken with Sachin's appointment as vice captain\nfor the tour of Sri Lanka following the England series. There was\nyet another century stand with Sachin (62), and Arnre also contributed\na half-century as did Sidhu. It had taken Kambli nearly four years to follow in Sachin's\nfootsteps.\nThe first Test against Sri Lanka, at Kandy, was a washout with only\n106\n\nSachin\n\n\f12 overs bowled.

Kambli was a year older than Sachin and\nplayed in the same school team, for Mumbai and West Zone junior\n(under-15) teams and then for the Mumbai Ranji Trophy side and\nfinally for India. But Sachin made a\nrapid transition from school to first class and then Test cricket, while\nVinod lagged behind.\nSachin, on the other hand, always had a very sensible attitude and a\nstrong family background, especially with his father and brother Ajit\nalways behind him.'\nSachin made his Test debut in November 1989 in Pakistan and\nless than a year later, in his ninth Test, scored his maiden century.\n\n\fKambli would follow him into Test cricket in the home series against\nEngland in 1993. But while Tendulkar would have to wait till late\n1999 to score his first Test double century, Kambli's very first threefigure knock was 224--in only his third Test. Kambli made his international debut in October 1991 in\nSharjah with scores of 23 not out, 40 and 30. But Sachin had stayed up the whole night in his hotel room,\nreading and watching television to keep himself awake for the late\nnight arrival.\nIfTendulkar's de hut in first-class cricket was a remarkable one for\na schoolboy, Kambli's early career was notable for the mountain of\nruns he scored in his first three seasons, starting with his debut in\n1989-90. So why did it take him four years to break\ninto Test cricket.\n110\n\nSachin\n\n\fThere was an incident in the 1992 World Cup that was held against\nKambli for quite sometime. In an interview to the Sportstar\n(30 September 1995), Kambli himself explained the difference in their\noutlook to life: 'He [Sachin] is reserved.\nIn the early years, Vinod and Sachin often found themselves batting\ntogether when one or the other reached a personal land mark, almost\nas if fate were playing a hand. Tendulkar was at the other end when\nKambli got his maiden century in One-day Internationals against\nEngland at Jaipur in 1993. This question was put to him by Sportstar (26\nMarch 1994), at which stage he was yet to score a century in One-day\nInternationals.' Kambli, for his part, has always expressed his\ngratitude to Sachin for his help and support. 'Sachin is my friend,\nphilosopher and guide,' he would repeatedly emphasize in interviews.\nBut the contrast in their batting form was the starkest in the Hero\nCup five-nation tournament which India won at home in November\n1993. Kambli and Azhar were the outstanding batsmen in the\ntournament. Tendulkar,\non the other hand, could only score 26 (not out), 2, 24, 3, 15 and 28\n(not out).com (December\n1999), 'Actually, whenever Sachin is there at the other end, the\nunderstanding between us is so good that if he hits a four, I don't take\nit as a challenge. I know people expect a lot of runs\nfrom me, just like they do from Sachin.'\nIn the same interview Kambli explained how Sachin's presence in\n112\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe team acted as an inspiration to him. 'He is such a thinking cricketer\nand a perfect team man. The earlier Indian record had stood in the name of\nSunil Gavaskar (21 innings/11 Tests) while the only batsmen quicker\nthan Kambli were Everton Weekes, Herbert Sutcliffe (both 12/9) and\nDon Bradman (13n). In fact,\nit was not till his forty-third first-class match (first Test v West Indies\nat Mumbai, November 1994) that Kambli was dismissed for a duck.\n'I'm no longer just Sachin's batting partner, I'm Vinod Kambli,' he\nproudly asserted after his second double century on the trot. The West Indians soon sorted\nhim out when they toured India late in 1994.\nThe Great Friendship\n\nIll\n\n\fLater, in 1996, one of the most enduring and poignant images of\nthe World Cup was that ofKambli coming off the field after the semifinal at Kolkata had been awarded to Sri Lanka followed crowd\ndisturbances. He was picked for the\nplaying XI ahead ofSourav Ganguly for the Sahara Cup in Toronto\nin 1996---which inevitably led to whispered allegations of nepotism\nagainst Tendulkar who was captain then.'\nSachin replied, 'lfl were to pick friends, then my brother [Ajit]\nshould be there in the Indian team. In\nthe public eye, Sachin and Vinod are still closely associated. Their\n114\n\nSachin\n\n\fjoint appearance in a Fiat Palio 1V commercial only reinforces that\nimage. But today, ask Wadekar why Sachin zoomed ahead and Kambli\nhas only played 17 Tests till date, and the former manager will sum it\nup with one word: 'attitude'.\nJournalist Vijay Lokapally of the Hindu, who knows both Sachin\nand Vi nod well, told me that the 'real' Sachin could be seen only in the\npresence of his great pal.", "Sachin_1996": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nIt was a virtual fait accompli following the England tour that Sachin\nTendulkar would be asked to take over the captaincy from Mohammad\nAzharuddin. The youngest in the history of Test\ncricket to take on the responsibility was 'Tiger' Pataudi. Mohan summed up the mood oflndian cricket followers:\n'The way forward for Indian cricket is to appoint Sachin Tendulkar\ncaptain now.'\nSure enough, on 8 August 1996, when the squad for the Singer Cup\none-day tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Sahara Cup 'Friendship' oneday series against Pakistan in Toronto was announced, Sachin was\nnamed captain.\nIn his debut series in Pakistan in 1989, Sachin's captain K.

India's failure to gain, very narrowly, a berth in the\nISO\n\nSachin\n\n\ffinal, did not in any way make a dent in his popularity. Tendulkar was in sparkling form and had three half-centuries in\nthe league phase. It started with Sachin giving\na short pep talk to his team as they went out to field under the lights.\n152\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut a year later, when the defeats outstripped the wins, the same style\n\nof captaincy was condemned as naive and over the t0p.\nSachin's first full series in charge against the strong SouthMricans\nwas a topsy-turvy affair. His two kno'cks at Kanpur showed a new Sachin to\nthe Indian public. It was a Sachin who eschewed stroke play for\noccupation of the crease, in an echo ofhis mentor Gavaskar's prediction\nin his column.Mohan in the Cricketer International (February 1997), at\nthe end of the series, 'The change at the helm effected during the year\nproved far reaching while also bringing in a twin benefit.

At this point, Sachin Tendulkar is doing\nvery well with the bat. And for the triangular ODI tournament after\nthat.\nContrast this with Sachin Tendulkar, who was recently\nappointed 'captain for 27 days. When, both before and after the\nAsia Cup, two selectors have systematically, under the guise of\nanonymity (the heck with the no names policy-the two\nselectors in question are Sambaran Bannerjee and Shivlal\nYadav) spoken to the media about their determination to sack\nTendulkar. When national\nnews magazine The Week carries a cover story, quoting a\nnational selector and an unnamed Beer official as saying that\n186\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere was a move, with sanction from a section of the board, to\nsack Tendulkar. We present\nsamples:\n'The reason why the selectors fell back on Azharuddin was\nthat he was the only player, other than Tendulkar, to be a\ncertainty in both forms of the game . Granted that Rahul Dravid has been droppednever mind, for now. But last we heard,\nSachin Tendulkar was perfectly happy with wife Anjali and\nnewborn daughter Sara.

In other words, Azharuddin, whose\nform and commitment are not in doubt by the selectors, ranks\nlast among the 6 specialist batsmen in the side.\nMeanwhile Desai, once the storm of questioning about the\nappointment of Azhar subsides, takes over from Rungta to\nMusical Chairs\n\n189\n\n\fmouth an extempore elegy to Sachin Tendulkar.\nMore from Desai: 'The selectors have gone on record\nappreciating Tendulkar's sportsmanship of taking all the blame\non himsel\u00a3 He is the type to carry on the battle.\nOn Friday, the national selectors unveiled their latest theory to\nexplain why Sachin had done badly as captain, and why\nAzharuddin was doing badly as a batsman. The media dictated that Prasad should not play in\n190\n\nSachin\n\n\fcertain games.\nMeanwhile, was Sachin sacked, or did he quit. From Desai, from Lele,\nfrom Shivlal Yadav.'\nIn other words-'Sorry, Sachin, you can't quit, because we\nwant to sack you.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by 18\nruns in the preliminary game. Azhar was Man of the Match for his\n100. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. His\nfiftieth score of 50-plus (he made 67) was smashed from 44 balls as the\ntwo raced to a stand worth 112 from just 14 overs, taking India to 245\nfor 7 from 3 7 overs (the match was shortened by fog). Their top scorer with\n77, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket.\nSachin also held three more catches to round off a sparkling all-round\ndisplay. He had bowling figures of7-0-45-3 and then he\nput the Pakistani bowlers to the sword with 95 runs from 78 balls,\nwith five sixes and six fours. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n192\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance. In the\nsecond final, when he was bowled in the second over by Azhar\nMahmood for 1, the batting folded up for 189 and Pakistan wrapped it\nup easily to take the tournament to the decider.\nThere too, it appeared to be Pakistan all the way as Saeed Anwar\nand Ijaz Ahmed went after the bowling and helped amass 314 for 5\nfrom 48 overs.5 overs with centurion Ganguly.) Ganguly\nwas Man of the Match for his superb 124 while Tendulkar took the\nMan of the Series award. He\nwas now considered the greatest bowler in the world, just as the tag of\ngreatest batsman rested on Sachin's shoulders. Tcndulkar was 204 not out, his best in first-class cricket. Warne was hit for 23 runs in his first two overs.\nTendulkar reached his first 50 from 46 balls and his century came\nfrom 90 with 15 fours and a six. By the time he declared, Tendulkar\nwas on 204, scored in 269 minutes from 192 balls, with 25 fours and\ntwo sixes. All the Warne v Tendulkar hype\nhad obviously got to Sachin.\nSachin's two previous tons against Australia in the 1991-92 series,\nMusical Chairs\n\n195\n\n\fat Sydney and Perth, had only contributed to a draw and a heavy\ndefeat.\nSo was Sachin's Man of the Match award.\n196\n\nSachin\n\n\fIndia maintained their mastery on their own soil. The series\nwas decided, and Azharuddin held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy that\nIndia had first won in 1996.\nThis time Tendulkar won his customary Man of the Match award for\nhis success, not with the bat but with the ball-a first for him. Tendulkar's analysis was 10-2-32-5, beating his\nprevious best of 4-34 against the West Indies at Sharjah in 1991. His seven sixes (plus five fours) were an Indian\nrecord, beating the six sixes hit by Kapil Dev against Zimbabwe in the\n1983 World Cup.\n198\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut if Australia, and Warne in particular, were relieved at the end\nof the tour, they could hardly have foreseen what was awaiting them\nin Sharjah just days later.", "Sachin_1998": "Desert Storm\n\nI'll be having nightmares of Sachin just running down the wicket and belting\nrne back over the head for six.

At this point, Sachin Tendulkar is doing\nvery well with the bat. And yet, sections of the media carry on\nthe inspired campaign-that Tendulkar is feeling the pressure\nof captaincy, that his batting is falling apart, that India's losses\nare attributable to this factor and this factor alone.\nHowever, the selectors, who have been making a case for the\nsacking of Tendulkar, fail to muster a majority within the\ncommittee. And board president Raj Singh\nDungarpur steps in to read the riot act, and indicate firmly that\nTendulkar should not be tampered with. And for the triangular ODI tournament after\nthat.\nContrast this with Sachin Tendulkar, who was recently\nappointed 'captain for 27 days.\nDesai opens his account in style, by saying 'There was no predetermined move to sack Tendulkar. When, both before and after the\nAsia Cup, two selectors have systematically, under the guise of\nanonymity (the heck with the no names policy-the two\nselectors in question are Sambaran Bannerjee and Shivlal\nYadav) spoken to the media about their determination to sack\nTendulkar. When national\nnews magazine The Week carries a cover story, quoting a\nnational selector and an unnamed Beer official as saying that\n186\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere was a move, with sanction from a section of the board, to\nsack Tendulkar. We present\nsamples:\n'The reason why the selectors fell back on Azharuddin was\nthat he was the only player, other than Tendulkar, to be a\ncertainty in both forms of the game . Granted that Rahul Dravid has been droppednever mind, for now. But last we heard,\nSachin Tendulkar was perfectly happy with wife Anjali and\nnewborn daughter Sara. Asked why Tendulkar was sacked,\nRungta on behalf of Desai said that the only criterion was bad\nbatting, and not any perceived defects in the captaincy.\nIf that is the case, then why is Tendulkar not captain of the\nTest side, considering that he is aggregating over 1,000 runs,\nand averaging over 63, in Tests this year-the highest of any of\nthe Indian batsmen. The selectors ask Tendulkar to bat\nlower down. Versus Pakistan, 3 off\n188\n\nSachin\n\n\f4.\nIn fact, against Sri Lanka, Azhar is ranked below Tendulkar,\nwho tops with 88, Ganguly (73),Jadeja (60) and Sidhu (53),\nwith 52 runs to his name. In other words, Azharuddin, whose\nform and commitment are not in doubt by the selectors, ranks\nlast among the 6 specialist batsmen in the side.\nIt is not my intention here to belittle the achievements of\nAzharuddin-who, by any yardstick, deserves to be ranked\namong the top five batsmen India has produced in\ncontemporary (even, perhaps, in all time) history. If captaincy can have a negative impact on Sachin\nTendulkar, how much more then, by the same logic, could it\nimpact on an already struggling Azharuddin.\nMeanwhile Desai, once the storm of questioning about the\nappointment of Azhar subsides, takes over from Rungta to\nMusical Chairs\n\n189\n\n\fmouth an extempore elegy to Sachin Tendulkar. Samples:\n~I of us have tremendous respect for Tendulkar, and not since\nGavaskar has anyone received so much admiration from all as\nTendulkar has got. How then do they account for the fact that\nTendulkar's average in Tests this year is higher than his lifetime\naverage.\nMore from Desai: 'The selectors have gone on record\nappreciating Tendulkar's sportsmanship of taking all the blame\non himsel\u00a3 He is the type to carry on the battle.\nOn Friday, the national selectors unveiled their latest theory to\nexplain why Sachin had done badly as captain, and why\nAzharuddin was doing badly as a batsman. The\nmedia held a gun to Tendulkar's head and asked him to bat at\nnumber four (interestingly, Desai before the Sri Lanka series\nvehemently denied that the selectors had asked Tendulkar to\nbat lower down, and said that was a media-propagated lie; today,\nRungta confirms that the selectors had indeed done so in a 'last\nditch attempt' to avoid sacking him-so who is lying, here.\nThe media consistently refused to give Tendulkar the team he\nasked for. The media dictated that Prasad should not play in\n190\n\nSachin\n\n\fcertain games.\nMeanwhile, was Sachin sacked, or did he quit. From Desai, from Lele,\nfrom Shivlal Yadav.\n'No, we have not officially been informed of Tendulkar's\nresignation . However, it must be made clear that any\ndecision on the matter will be our own decision, and not\nTendulkar's.'\nIn other words-'Sorry, Sachin, you can't quit, because we\nwant to sack you. Two months after Tendulkar's\nsacking, he resigned on health grounds. Tendulkar was back to his best in one-day games while\nAzharuddin's added responsibilities appeared to bring out the best in\nhim again.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by 18\nruns in the preliminary game. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. His\nfiftieth score of 50-plus (he made 67) was smashed from 44 balls as the\ntwo raced to a stand worth 112 from just 14 overs, taking India to 245\nfor 7 from 3 7 overs (the match was shortened by fog). Their top scorer with\n77, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket.\nSachin also held three more catches to round off a sparkling all-round\ndisplay. Once again,Tendulkar was in\nthe thick of things. He had bowling figures of7-0-45-3 and then he\nput the Pakistani bowlers to the sword with 95 runs from 78 balls,\nwith five sixes and six fours. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n192\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance. In the\nsecond final, when he was bowled in the second over by Azhar\nMahmood for 1, the batting folded up for 189 and Pakistan wrapped it\nup easily to take the tournament to the decider.\nThere too, it appeared to be Pakistan all the way as Saeed Anwar\nand Ijaz Ahmed went after the bowling and helped amass 314 for 5\nfrom 48 overs. The target seemed out oflndia's reach, though they\nwere given a flying start with Tendulkar smashing 41 from 26 balls. Amazing because it had been tried by\nTendulkar a month earlier at Sharjah against Pakistan.5 overs with centurion Ganguly.) Ganguly\nwas Man of the Match for his superb 124 while Tendulkar took the\nMan of the Series award. In 1996 there was\nthe one-off Test on an under-prepared pitch in Delhi which India\neasily won. He\nwas now considered the greatest bowler in the world, just as the tag of\ngreatest batsman rested on Sachin's shoulders.\nBefore the series, Tendulkar's preparations consisted ofgettingsome\nlocal leg-spinners to bowl to him on a pitch where the area outside the\nleg stump had deliberately been roughened. In a decade of\nfirst-class cricket, Tendulkar had not come close to a double century. Warne had figures of 16-1-116-0, his worst in firstclass cricket. Tcndulkar was 204 not out, his best in first-class cricket. From the\nIndian team's point ofview and from 1endulkar's too, this pertormance\nwas vital. Warne was hit for 23 runs in his first two overs.\nTendulkar reached his first 50 from 46 balls and his century came\nfrom 90 with 15 fours and a six. By the time he declared, Tendulkar\nwas on 204, scored in 269 minutes from 192 balls, with 25 fours and\ntwo sixes. Once again, Tendulkar employed the rough-outsidethe-leg-stump tactics at the Chennai nets. This time, though, he had\nbowlers of the calibre ofKumble and L.\nIndia won the toss and took first strike. All the Warne v Tendulkar hype\nhad obviously got to Sachin. The first ball was smashed past the bowler. Tendulkar had been too hasty in trying\nto assert his authority over Warne and had paid the price_.\nTendulkar walked to the wicket half an hour into the fourth Jay,\nwith the score on 115 tor 2, after Sidhu had softened up the bowlers\nwith a hard-hitting 64. By now the pitch was wearing rapiJly\nand Warne would no doubt have been in his element against any team\nexcept India at home, and any batsman except Tendulkar.\nSachin's two previous tons against Australia in the 1991-92 series,\nMusical Chairs\n\n195\n\n\fat Sydney and Perth, had only contributed to a draw and a heavy\ndefeat. 'Taking into\naccount the pitch conditions and the fact that he was facing arguably\nthe best wrist spinner of them all, Tendulkar's 199-ball innings was\none of the greatest batting exhibitions of modern times,' wrote OJ\nRutnagur in Wisden Cricket Monthly (May 1998).\nWarne was reduced to desperation by Tendulkar's uncanny\njudgement of the direction and degree of spin from the bowler's hand. All those hours spent\nplaying against the leggies in the 'nets', pitching in the rough, now\npaid off for Tendulkar. But Tendulkar was determined not to allow the\nbowler to gain the upper hand in their absotbing personal duel.\nSo was Sachin's Man of the Match award.

The next day was the\n'\nonly first-class\nfixture before the start of the first Test: a three-day\ngame against the Cricket Board Patron's XI at Rawalpindi where\nSachin made his first appearance in national colours. His performance removed any lingering doubt over his\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n43\n\n\finclusion in the first Test at the National Stadium, Karachi starting\non 15 November 1989. At 16\nyears and 205 days, Sachin became the youngest Indian Test player\nand the fourth youngest of all time. This was also Kapil Dev's hundredth\nTest match in which he claimed his three hundred and fiftieth Test\nwicket. Before him, only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had\nplayed as many matches for India.\nThe match also marked the turning point in the career of\nAzharuddin. He scored 35 in both innings and also equalled the world\nfielding record of five catches in an innings.\nAs far as the age record is concerned, three Pakistanis-Mushtaq\nMohammad, Aaqib Javed and Aftab Baloch-were all listed at the\ntime as being younger than Sachin on debut. Unofficially at least, this made Sachin\nthe youngest in history\u00b7 to play Test cricket. There was another\nsignificant debutant in the match on the Pakistani side-fast bowler\nWagar Younis.\nIt must have been a strange feeling indeed for a 16-year-old to\nsuddenly find himself among the big names oflndian cricket.'\n_\nSrikkanth won the toss in his first Test as captain and put Pakistan\nin.

Wasim\nAkram and Wagar bowled with hostility as Srikkanth, Navjot Singh\nSidhu, Manjrekar and Prabhakar all failed to reach double figures. I think he bowled four\nbouncers in a row. It was very tough and I thought I was not going to\never play Test cricket again.'\nIt was a torrid time for the teenager, but he hit 15 from 24 balls in\n29 minutes, including two fours, and was bowled by Younis with the\nscore at 73 for 5.'

By close on\nthe second day, the score had progressed to 157 without the loss of\nanother wicket as Shastri (25) and Kapil (49) began repairing the\ndamage. With two days still\nto play, they added 103 runs for the loss of three wickets. Shoaib's 95\nand Salim Malik's unbeaten 102 helped Imran declare at 305 for 5\nand set India the highly improbable task of scoring 453 in a minim urn\nof102 overs.\nWagar, who had grabbed four wickets in the first innings in a hostile\nspell, could not bowl in the second because of a strain in the back. Tendulkar did not get a chance to bat the second\ntime round. But his attack was further\nweakened with an injured SaleemJaffar only able to bowl17 overs in\nthe first innings.3 overs being bowled on the\nopening day and once again the Indian batting was in trouble after a\nuseful opening stand of 68 between Srikkanth and Sidhu. Sachin curbed his natural attacking instincts and batted\n46\n\nSachin\n\n\ffor 150 minutes, perhaps remembering the sound advice given by\nShastri after his dismissal in the first Test. The partnership was extended\nto 143 the next day and Sachin got his maiden Test half-century in\nonly his second innings. Sachin had batted for 244 minutes and 165\nballs and hit four fours when lmran, bowling at his best in the series so\nfar, had him beaten comprehensively and got him plumb in front for\n59.\nThe Indian batting came into its own in the second innings as it\nhad at Karachi a week before. Azhar marked his return to form with a\nstreaky 109 (his first century outside India) while Sidhu, Manjrekar\nand Prabhakar all scored half-centuries as India finished on 398 for 7.\nAzhar, not for the first time in his career, was like a cat on a hot tin roof\nin his 90s and caused jitters in the Indian camp as he almost got four\nbatsmen run out, including himself. Sachin (8) was one such victim,\nrooted a couple ofyards outside his crease, uncertain whether to respond\ntoAzhar's call for a single when he was on 99.\nSachin scored 41 before being bowled by Qadir. But\nhis innings was buried under Pakistan's mammoth 699 for 5. This was the same ground\nwhere he had made his debut against New Zealand in 1975 when,\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n47\n\n\ftoo, he had registered a century. All the batsmen except numbers 10 and 11 reached double\nfigures, with Sachin contributing 35.

The batsman rose on his toes and the ball was smashed\non the up, past the rooted cover fielder for another boundary. Sidhu went on to 97\nand India were 234 for 7 when the match was called off.'\nMohan, then chief cricket correspondent for the Hindu and the\nSportstar, was prescient when he predicted in the same article: 'This is\nno young man who will model his batting on Sunil Gavaskar's.

The third ODI had to be abandoned as the Indian\nfielders were constantly being pelted by stones.3 overs with Pakistan struggling on 28 for 3, Prabhakar having\npicked up all three wickets. It all started in leg-spinner Mush tag\nAhmed's second (and final) over in which he was smashed for 16 runs\nby Sachin: two sixes and a four.\nSachin replied, 'You are such a great bowler, you will not allow me\nto do that. Three balls in a row were dispatched\n50\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith power and timing over the ropes. The over produced an astonishing 27\nruns as Sachin reached his 50 from 18 balls. Srikkanth, one of the\nmost attacking batsmen in the game, was awestruck by his partner's\npower. By now it had come down to 17 for victory in the final over\nbowled by Akram. He is going to take bowlers apart in\ninternational cricket for a very long time.\n'I did say in 1989 that Tendulkar will be a great batsman. But the way he played\nagainst us was enough to convince me that he was going to be a great\nbatsman. I still remember when Wagar Younis bowled him his first\ndelivery when he made his Test debut in Kar<>_chi. He didn't connect the ball and was beaten, but I\ntold myself, \"Here is a kid who will make his name in cricket.\" When I bowled that memorable\nover, I didn't bowl badly, but Tendulkar hit me for three sixes and in all\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n51\n\n\fcollected 27 runs. It was after that match that I said that Tendulkar\nwill be a great batsman and I wasn't wrong because I knew that he\nwould make his name in cricket.\n'A couple of years later I went to Sharjah to play in a double-wicket\ntournament in which leading players like Salim Malik, Arjuna\nRanatunga, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and others were playing. Tendulkar\nwas also there. By that time he had made his name in the cricketing\nworld. That day I again asked him to score runs off my bowling. Tendulkar\nis certainly one of those players.'\nIn the first official One-day International at Gujranwala on 18\nDecember, Sachin was out for his first duck in international cricket,\ncaught Akram bowled Younis first ball.\n\n52\n\nSachin\n.", "Batsman_1990": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nA month later, the Indian team were in New Zealand under a new\ncaptain, Mohammad Azharuddin, and a new coach, Bishan Singh\nBedi. The team had a fresh, youthful look to it-it was, as Raj Singh\nwould describe it, the 'team for the 90s'. Tendulkar scored 13, 47, 4\n(not out) and 30 in the two warm-up games prior to the first Test at\nLancaster Park, Christchurch. And in the first innings against New\nZealand President's XI at Pukekura Park, New Plymouth on 22\nJanuary 1990, he became the youngest to reach the landmark of1000\nfirst-class runs.\nIt was a miserable batting performance by the visitors in the first\nTest at Christchurch as they were beaten by ten wickets with Tendulkar\nout for his first duck in Test cricket, in the first innings. India crumbled to 164 all out in reply to New Zealand's 459\nand, following on, could muster only 296 (Tendulkar: 24). Sir Richard\nHadlee became the first bowler in Test cricket to reach the landmark\nof 400 wickets when he bowled Manjrekar in the second innings.\nHadlee was arguably the best bowler in the world at the time and\nfacing him at such an early stage of his career was an education for\nSachin.\nMter that early setback, the Indian batting clicked in the second\nTest at Napier where over two days were lost to rain and a draw was the\n\n\fonly verdict possible. W V Raman was out to Hadlee off the first ball\nof the match and it was Prabhakar (95) and Manjrekar (42) who did\nthe early repair work, adding 92 for the second wicket. Azharuddin\nchipped in with 33 and his departure brought Tendulkar in at 152 for\n4.h Vengsarkar and Kapil came and went cheaply, and when\nwicketkeeper Kiran More joined Sachin at the crease, the score read\n218 for 6. More (73) played the dominant role as he and Tendulkar\nput together a record seventh-wicket stand worth 128 runs. Several\nairy-fairy shots outside off stump marked the early part ofTendulkar's\ninnings and he could have been out on numerous occasions. But his\nboyishness faded away gradually, and the longer he stayed at the wicket,\nthe more decisive he grew. By the close of the third day India were 348\nfor 7 and Tendulkar had batted five hours for his unbeaten 80. Sachin was still two months shy ofhis seventeenth birthday.\nA teammate, unnamed by Sachin, perhaps added to the pressure\nwhen he told the not-out batsman that he was 20 runs short ofhistory\nas he returned to the dressing room that evening.\nThe next morning, the first ball of the day from Danny Morrison\nwas dispatched to the cover boundary and then Sachin ran four runs\nto a shot to deep mid-off as he moved quickly to 88. Sachin had batted\nfor 324 minutes, faced 266 balls and hit four boundaries. The entire team consoled me,'\nsaid Sachin.' (Sports Channel video,\nDecember 1990)\n'I had two feelings when I caught him,' recalls Wright, now coach\nof the Indian team. 'Firstly one of relief, as at the time I was captain of\nNew Zealand and he was batting so beautifully we looked like we\n54\n\nSachin\n\n\fwould never get him out. My second feeling was one of almost feeling sorry for him as he\nwas only a lad really and he had batted so well and deserved a century.'\n'[Sachin's innings] left experienced members of the New Zealand\nteam agog,' wrote Don Neely, the convenor of the New Zealand\nselection panel, in the New Zealand CricketAlmanack (1991 ). Tendulkar played in the opening match against\nNew Zealand at Carisbrook but once again failed to score.\nHe was dropped for the next match against Australia but in the one\nafter that, against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on 6 March, he\nscored an attractive 36 from 39 balls, with five fours, as India won by\none run. Tendulkar was once again dropped for the\nmatch and Australia won by eight wickets to complete an unsuccessful\ntour for the Indians. It was a disappointing tournament for both\nSachin and the team as India lost both its league matches, to Sri Lanka\nand Pakistd. Sachin\nscored 10 (run out) and 20 in the two games.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of 1990. After scoring 19 in the opening cneday match against League Cricket Conference at Sunderland,\nTendulkar was rested for the first county game versus Yorkshire at\nHeadingley. Against Hampshire he had scores of32 and 58 not out as\nthe Indians lost by seven wickets. The victory came in the final over when\nTendulkar pulled West Indian fast bowler Ian Bishop for his second\nsix.\n\n\fSachin's knocks of 92 and 70 against Kent at Canterbury were\nsignificant as they were the first for him in the role of opener. According\nto manager and former Test stumper Madhav Mantri, Sachin had\nvolunteered for the slot, keeping the team's interests in mind. The\nIndians won the game by seven wickets. Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. h the end, England's\ntotal of229 all out (in the last of the 55 overs) was a credit to the Indian\nbowlers' persistence. Though\nTendulkar scored only 19, his straight six off spinner Eddie Hemmings\nwas a massive one, clearing almost 100 yards. Gooch was bowled cheaply.\nBut Robin Smith's 103 and 50s from Atherton and wicketkeeper Jack\nRussell helped England to a formidable 281 all out in exactly 55 overs.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. India\nHail the Boy King\n\n57\n\n\fneeded 145 runs from the last 20 overs to win and got them in some\nstyle, thanks in part to a delightful little innings of 31 from 26 balls\n(two fours) by Tendulkar. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India.\nIn the first Test at Lord's, Azharuddin won the toss and asked Gooch\nto bat first. Lamb\nraced to 139 at more than a run a ball, his partnership of 308 with\nGooch an all-wicket record for England against India. Mter adding 192 with\nRobin Smith, he was out to a tired stroke, bowled by Prabhakar for\n333. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis.\nOnce Azhar was bowled by Eddie Hemmings for 121, it was left to\nKapil to make England bat again. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries. Lamb,\nbatting in the second innings, had clouted Hirwani, but slightly\nmiscued the drive. Tendulkar raced across from the wide long off\nHail the Boy Kin. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1991) called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47. In 32 overs in Gloucestershire's\nfirst innings, he picked up the wickets of Hodgson, Romaines and\nAlleyne, three top order batsmen, for 79 runs. This was after left-arm\nspinner Raju had ended his tour with a broken hand while batting in\nthe first innings. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on 322\nfor 3, inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. His 179 was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n60\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. When\nPrabhakar joined Tendulkar at 183 for 6, there were still two and a half\nhours remaining for England's bowlers to mop things up. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. Tendulkar was watchful, considering the perilous position\nthe team was in. An elegant back-foot boundary offFraser took him\nto 96 and then at 97 there was just that tiny sign of nerves as he ducked\nFraser and left his bat sticking up, getting a single to long leg in the\nprocess. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. But not too\nyoung to save his side in battle, overshadowing his teammates, some\nalmost twice his age, who had recklessly thrown away their wickets\non the final day. And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for 225 minutes, faced 189 balls\nand struck 17 boundaries. It made him at 17 years and 112 days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune 1996), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October 1990). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over 30 books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n62\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred. Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored 68 in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make 119 not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing 160. He was only 17 years and 112 daysthe second-youngest Test centurion, after Mushtaq Mohammadand we wondered what he might be capable of doing in the next ten\nyears or so. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. In his second-innings century\nTendulkar escaped a chest-high caught-and-bowled to off-spinner\nEddie Hemmings when he was only 10. But\nyoung Tendulkar stood solid, and so did Prabhakar. With the fielders clustered\naround him like members of the fan club that was soon to make his\nlife difficult, Tendulkar dealt with everything England dished out,\ndriving powerfully and cutting like a flash. He saw India to safety,\nand half-an-hour later, he was stepping forward in the pavilion to\nreceive his Man of the Match award.\"'\nSaid Richie Benaud on TV after Tendulkar had received his award\nfrom David Lloyd: We'll see a lot more centuries from his bat.' Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his 20s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries. This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch (80 in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten 157 by David Gower. Tendulkar was third in the averages with 245\nruns at 61. It was a summer full of tons and\nruns and yet it was Tendulkar's match-saving knock at Old Trafford\nthat continued to be the talking point of the year. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score 388 in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with 108 not out.\nTendulkar finished with the highest aggregate for the touring side,\nHail the Boy King\n\n65\n\n\fwith 945 runs from 11 matches (19 innings) at the impressive average\nof63.\n\n66\n\nSachin.", "Batsman_1992": "World Cup Debut\n\nInzamam is a much better batsman against fast bowling.\nNew Zealand, which had failed to make the semi-finals in 1987,\nstunned World Cup holders Australia by 37 runs in Auckland, with\n\n\fKiwi skipper Martin Crowe stroking a masterly 100 not out-and\nsurprising one and all by opening the bowling with off-spinner Dipak\nPatel. On the same day at the Western Association Cricket Association\n(wAcA), India came within a whisker of upsetting the 1987 runnersup England, ultimately losing by just nine runs. Smith was out at 197 for 4 and the last six wickets\nthen crashed for just 27 runs. The English tally for the last seven overs\nwas 39 runs for the loss of six wickets and a total of236 for 9 appeared\neminently achievable. At 63 for 2, it was left to the Mumbai pair of\nShastri and Tendulkar to put the innings back on the rails. The perfectly pitched away cutter had him playing forward\nand well caught by wicketkeeper Alec Stewart for a smart 35 from 44\nbalb, with five fours. Botham also accounted for Vinod Kambli and the equation\ncame down to 51 from seven overs, then to 36 from three with the last\nwicket pair ofBanerjee and Srinath at the crease.

Dean Jones hit 90 from 109 balls, while\nBorder's miserable form with the bat continued, and they finished on\n237 for 9. India, in its innings, had reached 45 for 1 (Srikkanth\nthe batsman out, bowled for a duck by McDermott) after 16. Azhar played typically glorious,\nwristy shots all round the ground and raced to 93 from 103 balls (ten\nfours) before becoming the first offour run-out victims in the innings:\nBorder's rocket-like throw caught him short of the crease. With eight overs and six wickets in hand, the target had come down\nto 77. Tendulkar's failure (he was out for 11)\nput further pressure on the lower order. A miscalculation by Border saw his main strike\nWorld Cup Debut\n\n89\n\n\fbowler McDermott bowl the penultimate over from which he\nconceded just six runs and now 13 were needed from the last over by\noff-spinner Tom Moody. But he was bowled next ball, trying to finish the game with\nanother four. At full tilt, Steve Waugh ran\nround and reached for the catch, only to drop it even as the crowd\ngasped in dis belie\u00a3 Waugh grabbed the ball as it slid towards the gutter\nwhile Srinath and Raju ran for their lives, and threw as the batsmen\nwere crossing for the third run that would have tied the game.\nThe two teams met at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 4 March\n1992. The Indian total of216\nfor 7 was built around Ajay Jadeja's 46 (he opened in place of Shastri)\nand Tendulkar's 54 not out from 62 balls.\nInzamam-ul-Haq and Zahid Fazal both fell for two and at 17 for 2, the\nIndian bowlers had gained the upper hand. It\nwas Tendulkar who made the breakthrough, getting Sohail caught\nlow down at midwicket by Srikkanth for 62. Once Miandad had been\nbowled by Srinath for a painstaking 40, the rest of the batting fell apart\nand subsided to 173 all out, leaving India winners by 43 runs and\nTendulkar with his first Man of the Match award in the World Cup.\nIndia opened with Kapil Dev, but it was Tendulkar who stole the\nshow. He smashed his highest ODI score of81 from 77 balls, with eight\nfours and a six, that saw them to 203 for 7. He mastered all the bowlers\nexcept veteran off-spinner John Traicos, who was 26 years older than\nhim.\nTendulkar failed against the West Indies at Wellington, caught\nbehind off a perfect leg-cutter from Curtly Ambrose as India went\ndown by five wickets.

When\nTendulkar first came to Pakistan in 1989, his timing was very\ngood. Tendulkar's innings management is much better than\nInzamam's. He times the ball very well and he manages his\ninnings to perfection. But I still say that Inzamam is a much\nbetter batsman against fast bowlers. He has played a number of\nmatch-winning innings for Pakistan against quality fast\nbowlers, whereas I don't think Tendulkar has played that many\nmatch-winning knocks for India. There are lots of other\nbatsmen I would like to mention. Allan Border and Javed\nMiandad were not that talented, but the big plus of these\n92\n\nSachin\n\n\fbatsmen was that they were very good at building their\ninnings-a quality which certainly Tendulkar has.\n\nWorld Cup Debut\n\n93\n\n\fII\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\nNo one could have done a betterjob if breaking the ice.\n- Geoffrey Boycott\nFew Indian cricketers have enjoyed long stints in English county\ncricket. Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Azharuddin played briefly for\nNorthamptonshire, Glamorgan and Derbyshire respectively, while\nin more rect:nt years Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid\nand Sourav Ganguly have turned out for various teams with mixed\nresults. Sunil Gavaskar played just one season, and that was in 1980\nfor Somerset. The only Indian who made a career out of county cricket\nwas wicketkeeper-batsman Farokh Engineer who was part of the\nLancashire squad that enjoyed much one-day success in the 1970s.\nSachin Tendulkar had made a huge impression on the English public\nand the media on his first tour in 1990. Finally, Australian\nfast bowler Craig McDermott was signed up on a three-year contract\nstarting from 1992. Former Yorkshire\ncaptain Geoffrey Boycott, the focus ofa great deal of controversy at the\nclub during his playing days, then decided to sign up Tendulkar in\nplace of McDermott. But\nwith time running out, a lack of international fast bowlers to choose\nfrom, and sponsors Yorkshire Television keen on a big-name signing,\nthe final choice remained Tendulkar. Yorkshire ChiefExecutive\nChris Hassell flew to Mumbai in April 1992 for the signing, which\nTendulkar agreed to after receiving the stamp of approval from coach\nRamakant Achrekar and mentor Sunil Gavaskar. For his part, Tendulkar fitted\nin remarkably well, considering he was just 19 and aware that there\nwas a fair amount of opposition to the century-old 'no outsiders'\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n95\n\n\ftradition being dismantled in his favour. There\nwas just one century (exactly 100 vDurham) and seven 50s in a total\nof 1070 championship runs from 25 innings at 46. In the Sunday League (40 overs), his\nbest was 107 from 73 balls against Lancashire. Teammate Phil Carrick was quoted on that innings by Scyld\nBerry in Wisden Cricket Monthly Oune 1996):\nI walked over to have a chat with him as he came in and I\nremember him staring at me quite intently-perhaps he\ncouldn't understand me.\nAgainst Essex he struck a classy 93 as Yorkshire won by a huge\nmargin of an innings and 55 runs. The Roses match saw him strike 56\nnot out and 48 as Yorkshire beat traditional rivals Lancashire by four\nwickets. In addition, he struck 86 against Hampshire and a brilliant\n96\n\nSachin\n\n\f92 against Gloucestershire. Sachin played well for a\nmedium team but at the age of18 he was not the finished article. As if he were\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n97\n\n\fstill on trial. He was interviewed by Andrew Collomose for the Cricketer\nInternational (November 1992), at Scarborough, during his last game\nagainst Nottinghamshire.'\nIn late 1992, India were invited to be the first team to play in South\nMrica since the apartheid ban imposed in 1970. The Indian team had\nearlier made a brief stopover in Harare en route to South Mrica, where\nZimbabwe gave a pretty good account of themselves in their maiden\n98\n\nSachin\n\n\fTest. The Test marked the second occasion on which Tendulkarwas\nout for a duck, caught and bowled by master off-spinner John Traicos.\nThe one-day festival match at Raadjasfontein that kicked off the\nSouth Mrican tour saw Tendulkar score a century against Nicky\nOppenheimer's XI. But there were quite a few interesting events that captured\nthe attention of cricket historians. South Mrican captain Kepler Wessels, who had\nearlier represented his adopted country, Australia, in Test cricket,\nbecame the first to score a century for two different countries. Ramakant\nAchrekar's 'boy' Praveen Amre became the ninth Indian to score a\ncentury on Test debut.\nThe most dramatic moment of the match came on 14 November\n1992, the second day of the Test. Tendulkar was on 11 and the total on\n38 for 2. Cricket\nhad entered the technological age, at last. West Indian Steve Bucknor was the neutral umpire\nstanding in the series. South Mrica were 61 for 4 in their first innings, with Rhodes\non 28, when Srinath threw down the stumps with a direct throw. It was a mistake no international umpire\nwould make again.\nIndia too lost early wickets. It was 27 for 2 when Tend ulkar walked\nin. Tendulkar started hesitantly. Teammate Kapil Dev\nat 21 years 27 days was the previous record holder. It was Tendulkar's\nnineteenth Test and twenty-eighth innings. In an\nIndian total of227, Tendulkar scored virtually half the runs off his\nown bat. Once again,\nthe luminaries of cricket were ecstatic in their reaction to Tendulkar's\nbatting. Under incredible pressure, he batted\nsuperbly. He\nmoves his feet very quickly into position and can adjust to the pace\nand bounce superbly' (Sportstar, 12 December 1992).\nBetween the second and third Tests, India and South Africa played\na series of seven One-day Internationals. Tendulkar was a major\ndisappointment, with only 144 runs from seven innings, and a highest\nscore of32.\nDonald came into his own in the third Test at Port Elizabeth and\nIndia were crushed by nine wickets. There was an extraordinary\ncentury by Kapil Devin the second innings. Perhaps the most shocking\nwas umpire Rudi Koertzen's decision to give Tendulkar caught behind\nfirst ball off Donald in the second innings, when the ball had brushed\nhis pad. The departing batsman was horrified and non-striker Shastri\ndropped his bat in disgust and had words with the umpire.\nMuch of the cricket played in the three Tests had been dreary. But\nthe fourth and final match at Cape Town made a dubious entry into\ncricket's record books as the slowest of all time. The Indian batsmen\nwere wary of the South African pace attack. Tendulkar was his side's. top scorer in the match with 73. But\neven his normally attacking batsmanship was curtailed, the 50 taking\nhim 167 minutes. For Kepler Wessels and his countrymen, the series\nmarked a triumphant return to Test cricket.\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n101.", "Batsman_1993": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nEngland's tour to India under the captaincy of Graham Gooch saw\nMohammed Azharuddin placed on probation, in a manner of\nspeaking. His appointment was confirmed only till the first Test in\nKolkata in january 1993. It was\nKambli's twentieth birthday and he celebrated it in style with his first\ncentury in international cricket. His score of100 not out came from\n149 balls and there was some adverse comment at the end of the game\nover the manner in which he crawled through the 90s.\nThey batted till the end of the innings with Kambli reaching his\ncentury in the last over.\nBoth batsmen failed in the second om at Chandigarh, though India\nwon by five wickets to draw level. It was here, against England at the Eden Gardens,\nthat Azhar ~ad first dazzled the cricket world with his century on\ndebut in the 1984-85 series, followed by two more on the trot. The captain's dazzling 182 crushed\nEngland's spirits and victory was India's by nine wickets. Tendulkar's\n50 in the first innings promised much more before he had a lapse of\nconcentration and fished at a wide delivery from Devon Malcolm. In February 1993, Chepauk was witness to\nTendulkar's first century at home and his fifth overall. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. In 1998, an outstanding innings against Australia saw Sachin\nmaster Shane Warne at Chepauk. Three\nyears later, in March 2001, Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series 2-1. Though he\nbowled just two overs in each innings, he surprised the cognoscenti\nby bowling genuine leg breaks.\nIndia had won the series. A new\nrecord total by India at home, and another innings victory. The Test was a\ntriumph for the Mumbai trio of Kambli, Tendulkar and Amre,\nparticularly the left-hander.

He joined a band of 25 others whose first three-figure knocks\n104\n\nSachin\n\n\fwere over 200, among them two legendary left-banders, Garry Sobers\nand Brian Lara.

His 78\ntook nearly four and a half hours and was not nearly as flawless as his\nbatting in the previous Test.\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests: 236 not out by Sunil Gavaskar.\nBefore the series began, the selectors had named Tendulkar captain\nof the under-25 side which played against England at Cuttack prior to\nthe first Test. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India.

Among his\ncontemporaries, comparisons have most frequently been made\nbetween Tendulkar and the West Indian batting genius, Brian Lara. But since the 1990s, the Indian and the West\nIndian have emerged as the greatest batsmen of their generation, good\nenough to be part of many all-time World XIs. Even as this chapter\nwas being written, Lara scored his sixteenth century in his eighty-first\nTest, at Galle, Sri Lanka. It was his first Test century in 11 months. In\nthe third and final Test of the series at Colombo, he scored 221 and\n130, and finished the series with an astonishing 688 runs (average\n114. 'Lara and Tendulkar are the hardest batsmen\nto bowl against, but the West Indian has troubled me more. Tendulkar\nis positive and difficult to bowl against, but I have an advantage over\nhim because he is a right-hander. Most batsmen\nare restricted in some way and, as a bowler, you can focus on their\nweak points. When you are playing a good bowler, you have to be\npatient and pick the right ball to hit and Lara does that well. He became only the sixth batsman to score a double\ncentury and a century in the same Test (Graham Gooch had made a\ntriple century and a century). Still, he has a long way to go to catch up\nwith Tendulkar's current record and has rapidly fallen behind after\nhis golden year of 1994. In 1997, Lara scored 394 runs\nat 39.40 while Tendulkar's figures were 1000 runs at 62.87 for Tendulkar); in 1999 Lara's 737 runs\nwere scored at an average of27.29 compared to Tendulkar's 1088 at\n68. In 2000 the comparative figures were: Tendulkar: 575 runs at\n63.88; Lara: 497 at 29.23; and in 2001 Lara had 1151 runs at 63.94\nwhile Tendulkar's record was 1003 at 62.\nIn the fifth Test against England at St. John's, Antigua in April\n1994, amidst scenes of unprecedented jubilation, Lara broke the world\nTest record of fellow West Indian Sir Garfield Sobers. Now Lara eclipsed\nit with a powerful innings of375. Then, inside of SO days, he broke the\n500-run barrier for the first time in the history of first-class cricket\nwith an astounding innings of 501 not out for Warwickshire against\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n127\n\n\fDurham at Edgbaston in the English county championship. It made\nLara the first batsman after Bradman to simultaneously hold the record\nfor the highest Test and first-class score. Suddenly the Prince of\nTrinidad was being proclaimed the king of cricket. And the cricket\nworld had eyes for only one man.\nLara had first announced himself with a sublime innings of277\n(run out) against Australia at Sydney in December 1992, his maiden\nTest century. Tendulkar, it may be recalled, had taken more than ten\nyears to score his first double century.\nLara is four years older than Tendulkar. He made his debut a year\nlater (1990), also in Pakistan. But it took him two years to establish\nhimself in the West Indian team. No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in 1994. It not only brought\nhim tons of runs and records galore, but also fame and wealth the likes\nof which cricket had rarely seen. It was dunng that\nseries in England in 1995 when things were spiralling downwards\nthat Curtly Ambrose bluntly told the star batsman at a team meeting:\n'It seems like you don't want to bat long again.\nBy now, he had made it clear to one and all that he was determined to\nbe captain of the West Indies and that he would allow nothing and\nnobody to get in his way. Lara did get his chance in the Barbados Test\nagainst India in March 1997. Leading India was Tendulkar. Things seemed to be looking\nup as the West Indies won the Tests 3-1 and the ODI series 4-1. Bowled out by Australia for an all-time low of 51 and crushed\nby 314 runs in the first Test, the end appeared near for the West Indies\nand not for the last time either. Lara had not scored a century in 13\nTests.\nBut single-handedly, Lara had restored the pride ofWest Indian cricket,\nand his own reputation in the bargain, with his breathtaking batting. Back home in India\naround the same time, Tendulkar too resigned from the captaincy that\nhad been thrust on him for the second time, late in 1999. Golf, too, had become an obsession,\ndistracting him from cricket.\nAlmost every current and ex-cricketer ranks Tendulkar above Lara\nin contemporary cricket, though as we have seen, it was not always\nthat way. Allan Donald, for one, thought that Tendulkar was in a\ndifferent class to Lara as a professional cricketer. He was a model\ncricketer, and despite the intolerable pressures he faced back home in\nIndia, remained a really nice guy. He also considered Tendulkar the\nbest batsman in the world, pulling away from Brian Lara every year.\nWriting in Sportsworld (May 1995), 'Tiger' Pataudi commented:\n'Tendulkar, I reckon is even more talented than Lara, but he is yet to\ndevelop the latter's temperament and so often pleases to tease.' And in\nGe1frey Boycott on Cricket: 'The way in which he [Tendulkar] reacted\n[to losing the captaincy in 1998] at a time of great stress illustrates the\ndifference between Tendulkar, who did not cause a moment's fuss or\ntrouble, and the petulant Lara. The product of a careful upbringing in\nIndia, Tendulkar, despite his superstar status, simply refused to waste\nhis time in altercations with the Indian board and selectors.' And finally,\nSir Donald Bradman in Roland Perry's Bradman's Best: 'Lara and\nTendulkar have proved to be the two best batsmen in the 1990s.\n130\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar has a very strong defence. But he can be\naggressive, as he showed in that one-day series against Australia early\nin 1998 and in the Tests in India.'\nAs though to clinch the issue, Tendulkar was the only\ncontemporary cricketer to find a place in Sir Dan's controversial\n'Dream Team' released by Perry shortly after the legend's death in\nFebruary 2001.\nLara and Tendulkar came face to face in a Test series for the first\ntime when West Indies toured India late in 1994 under Walsh's\ncaptaincy. But Tendulkar certainly\nhad the better of the exchanges, averaging double that of Lara (67 to\n33), with a century and two half-centuries. Lara had two 50s with a top\nscore of 91 in the third Test at Mohali, which West Indies won to\nsquare the series. He failed to register a century in either the Tests,\nthe first-class tour matches or the numerous ODIS.\nBefore the series against the West Indies, it was Sri Lanka's turn to be\nflattened by the Indian steamroller early in 1994, losing all three Tests\nby an innings. The series was notable for Kapil Dev first\nequalling and then overtaking Sir Richard Hadlee's world Test record\nof 431 wickets. Opener Sidhu\nbattered the Sri Lankan bowlers as he smashed eight sixes in his 124.\nBut it was Tendulkar's 142 that was a class apart.\n'Sidhu helped me a lot,' said Tendulkar after his seventh Test\ncentury. 'He smashed the bowlers and that gave me enough insight\ninto the bowling.' Poised at 88 at the end of the first day,\nSachin reached his ton the next morning from just four balls from\nmedium-pacer Pramodya Wickramasinghe. He admitted the 100 had been on his mind when he\nresumed his innings with Azhar for company. Indian cricket fans\nwere also keen to see world record holder Lara in action. The first Test at\nMumbai was played on a pitch of such variable bounce that the West\nIndies batsmen used chest pads even while facing the spinners. It was\ntenacious batting in both innings by the Indians and an outstanding\nspell of fast bowling in the second by Srinath that swung the match\nIndia's way. Victory early on the fifth morning was the tenth for\nAzharuddin, a record for an Indian captain. Both Prabhakar and\nAzharuddin failed to score. Wicketkeeper NayanMongia (80) was\nthe utdikely top scorer and his sixth-wicket stand of 136 with\nManjrekar (51) took India to the respectable total of272. Left-arm\nspinner Raju then picked up five wickets to give India a kad of 29\nruns. This allowed the sting to be\ndrawn from the wicket, and that was all the Indian batsmen needed. But as\nthe day wore on, the pitch eased out and the Mumbai pair ofManjrekar\nand Tendulkar took the game away from the West Indies. Tendulkar's\n85 (he was the joint top scorer in the Test with Junior Murray) was a\nperfect blend of attack and defence, while Manjrekar came up with his\nIll\n\nSachin\n\n\fsecond 50 of the match. Tendulkar straight drove Walsh and worked\nhim off his pads for fours and then forced the removal ofleg-spinner\nDhanraj, hitting him for a six over long on and a four over mid-off.\nBoth the batsmen looked in total control as they added 74 for the sixth\nwicket before they fell to attacking shots. Tendulkar's 85 came from\n139 balls before he sliced an offbreak from Hooper to be caught behind.\nThe tail wagged furiously with Kumble (42) and Srinath (60) flogging\nthe bowling. The target for the West Indies (363) was beyond their\nreach, and Srinath finished with 4 for 48 and the Man of the Match\naward. The West Indies, let off the hook then,\nstaged a fightback at Mohali in the third and final Test to salvage their\npride and unbeaten record. Nagpur saw Tendulkar score his first\ncentury against the West Indies as India built up a formidable 546 for\n9 declared and claimed a first innings lead of 118 runs. He added 177\nfor the third wicket with Sidhu and a further 202 with Azhar (97) for\nthe fifth.\n'I gained in confidence watching Sachin bat,' said Sidhu. It helps batting with Sachin. The two were proving to be India's\nbatting mainstays. Tendulkar had come off two ducks in a row at\nFaridabad and Mumbai in the one-day series and had been feeling the\npressure.'\nSidhu and Tendulkar wrested control of the West Indies' attack\nafter off-spinner Carl Hooper had got rid of Prabhakar and Kambli\ncheaply. The double century partnership with his captain was the\nfirst over 200 in which Tendulkar was associated. The 179 was his\nhighest Test score till then and it took a brilliant, diving catch by Lara\nat mid wicket offWalsh to terminate it; he faced 319 balls and hit 24\nfours and a six. But the overcautious Indian batting in the second\ninnings and a late declaration allowed the visitors to escape. There\nwas another century stand between Sidhu (76) and Tendulkar (54) in\nthe second innings, for the third wicket.\nThe West Indies stormed back to take the third Test at Mohali and\ndraw the series. Adams was the batting hero\nand the Man of the Series. The West Indies had a first\ninnings lead of 57. The Indian innings was marked by a maiden\ncentury by Manoj Prabhakar. Manjrekar and Tendulkar both chipped\nin with 40 while Srinath (52) was once again a revelation with the bat.\nLara (91) in the role of opener finally sparkled in the second innings\nwhen his team was looking for quick runs. He took four fours off a\nSrinath over. But just when he seemed set to reach his first century in\nthe subcontinent, he walked after nicking the ball to the keeper. India looked to Tendulkar, as usual.\nTendulkar started off the 001 series against the West Indies with\ntwo successive ducks. In the final against West\nIndies at Calcutta, Man of the Match Tendulkar was top scorer with\n66 and returned figures of1 for 35 from eight overs as India won by 72\nruns.\nLara and Tendulkar came head-to-head again in the Carribean in\n2002. West Indies captain Carl Hooper admitted the pressure got\nthe better of Lara in the second Test which India won. Tendulkar scored his fourth\nODI century of the 1994-95 season in the league game against Sri\nLanka which India won by eight wickets. In the process, he became\nthe youngest to cross 3000 ODI runs.\nMeanwhile, back home Tendulkar had been appointed captain of\nMumbai for the 1994-95 Ranji Trophy season, and it turned out to be\na season of triumph for both the team and the captain, culminating in\na century in both innings in the final against Punjab. The first-innings\ncentury was reached in 83 balls, the second from a mere 66---the\nfourth fastest in Ranji history. (The next season he would score the\nfastest century in domestic one-day cricket-from 69 balls for Wills\nXI in the Wills Trophy quarter-final against Hyderabad in Rajkot.) In\nthe five Ranji matches that season (seven innings) he had 856 runs\nwith five centuries at 122. Those 856\nruns were scored from S59 balls with 23 sixes and 106 fours. At 21, Sachin.\nTendulkar had been away inN ew Zealand when Mumbai regained\nthe Ranji Trophy after a gap of ten years in 1994. So, being part of a\nwinning Mumbai team was special for him. Tendulkar scored 116 in the final against Haryana, which\nMumbai won by nine wickets. Apart from 856 runs in the\nRanji Trophy that year, he had struck his first ODI century as well as\ntons against New Zealand at Baroda, West Indies atJaipur and against\nSri Lanka in the Asia Cup in Sharjah. The Wills Trophy saw him\nscore 57 and 116 for Mumbai. He had 285 runs in the Wills World\nSeries, 247 in the Pepsi one-day series against the West Indies and 402\nruns in three Tests against the same team.\nMy overall performance was better and I think I improved technically\nas a batsman. For Sachin, it was a memorable year: his first 001 century,\nfirst Ranji Trophy triumph, first century against the West Indies, the\nAsia Cup . and there would be one more, even more cherished\n136\n\nSachin\n\n\fmoment.'\nThere was to be another landmark in Tendulkar's life that year.\n\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n137.", "Batsman_1996": "World Cup 1996-and England Again\n\nHe plays much the same as I played.ificent tournament, nonetheless, won in grand style by the Sri\nLankans who defeated Australia in the final at Lahore.\nIndia were once again led by Azharuddin. Their batting challenge\nwas now firmly in the hands ofSachin Tendulkar who had matured\nfrom 'promising' prior to the 1992 World Cup, to one of the best\nbatsmen in the world four years later. Here again, Tendulkar failed\nto fire, and ended with just one half-century. There were a few months between the series and the World\nCup which enabled him to iron out the technical flaws which had\ncrept into his batting.'\nThat innings came in India's opening World Cup tie against Kenya\nat Cuttack; he was 127 not out, at nearly a run a ball. India, needing\n200 to win, coasted to victory with seven wickets to spare after\nTendulkar's opening stand of 163 with Ajay Jadeja. It was his maiden\nWorld Cup 100 and won him the Man of the Match award.\nIndia's first big test would come three days later, at Gwalior,\nwhere they met the West Indies, champions in 1975 and 1979 but by\nnow in rapid decline. But it was true that for Indian fans,\nSachin was the main event. Inevitably, the rnatch was seen as a\nTendulkar v Lara clash. Not only did India maintain their\nrecent supremacy over the twice-world champions by winning by\nfive wickets, but Tendulkar also outshone his famed rival. The scores:\nLara-2; Tendulkar-70. Chasing Windies'\n173, India lost two early wickets and it could so easily have been three:\nTendulkar was dropped at square leg when on 12, and then on 22 in\nthe tenth over. Tendulkar slammed 79 for the third wicket with Azhar in 16\novers and then added 31 with Vinod Kambli before being run out for\n70 after a mix-up with his chum. By then, India wen: comfortably\nplaced at 125 for 4 and the Man of the Match award was Sachin's\nagain. If India v West\nIndies was billed as Tendulkar v Lara, this one was the TendulkarWarnc show. This time Sachin won the individual honours against\nthe leg-spinner. But he was outshone by Mark Waugh and the\nAustralians who won the contest by 16 runs. Waugh's 126\nfollowed on from his 130 against Kenya four days earlier, making him\nthe first batsman to make back-to-back centuries in the World Cup. McGrath missed a tough caughtand-bowled chance and was promptly carted for 27 runs from two\novers. It seemed only Sachin could save India as he raced to his\n50 from 41 balls. Warne's very first delivery was hit straight and\nhard for six and suddenly Tendulkar was on 90 from 88 balls. Bowling innocuous offbreaks,\nhe saw Tendulkar charge out and bowled wide down the leg side. Ian\nHealy whipped off the bails and the life had gone out of the Indian\nbatting. Tendulkar and Azhar were in devastating form,\nplundering 99 runs from the last ten overs. Only 23 overs had been bowled\nwhen Sri Lanka lost their fourth wicket at 141.\nTendulkar's only failure in the entire tournament came against\nZimbabwe in the last league game, when he was bowled by Heath\nStreak for three. Openers Sidhu and Tendulkar\nmade a cautious start and 90 was on the board before the latter dragged\none from Ata-ur-Rehman on to his stumps for 31. It was a sedate innings by Tendulkar's standards,\ntaking 59 balls, as the openers weathered a hostile opening spell of\nfour overs from Wagar Younis. All the top order batsmen got a good\nstart with Sidhu holding the innings together with 93. His 45 from 26 balls helped India to a huge 287\nfor8. Anwar was the first to\ngo for 48 from 32 balls while Sohail continued to attack.\nHe smashed Vcnkatesh Prasad for four, then promptly offered the\nbowler some gratuitous advice. Prasad kept his cool, his next ball was\nfull and straight and bowled So hail for 55. Prasad picked\nup two more wickets, Ani. Then, for a brief while,\nthe Indian bowlers looked to be on top when they got rid of the top\nthree batsmen with just 35 on the board. But Sri Lanka recovered to\npost a healthy total, with Tendulkar looking the most impressive of\nthe bowlers with 2 for 34 from his ten overs. The ball brushed\nTendulkar's pad and he moved out of his crease, looking for a leg bye.\nKaluwitharana behind the stumps quickly gathered the ball and\nremoved the bails; the third umpire confirmed the batsman's backward\nlunge had come too late.\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n143\n\n\fThe Indian batting after that defied all reason. Seven wickets went\ndown for 22 runs as one a'fter the other, the batsmen committed harakiri.\nTendulkar finished with the most runs in the tournament: 523\nruns at 87.17 from his seven matches-still the only instance in the\nWorld Cup of a batsman exceeding 500 runs.50) and De Silva (89. Kumble\ncaptured the most wickets (and took the most catches, too). But\nthey were beaten by eight wickets by Pakistan and edged out of the\nfinal on net run rate. Tendulkar's round 100 was his first century\nagainst Pakistan in either form of the game.\nGardiner of Zimbabwe. His 'fault' was the MRF logo on his bat, which\ninfringed the International Cricket Council's (Icc) ruling prohibiting\nlogos of a particular size other than that of the bat manufacturer. This time it was\nIndia's turn to pip Pakistan on net run rate and reach the final against\nSouth Mrica, who made it a debut to remember by winning the match\nby 38 runs. There was, however, the considerable consolation for India\n144\n\nSachin\n\n\fof beating Pakistan in the return match by 28 runs, having lost the\nopening game by 38 runs.\nNot surprisingly, it was Tendulkar who led the charge with his\nsecond century in the last three matches against Pakistan. He also\npicked up two wickets, including the last one ofSaqlain Mushtaq's,\nlbw.\nAs a result, Tendulkar received a warning from match referee Ranjan\nMadugalle for the abuse and pointed finger directed at the departing\nbatsman.\nThe match saw India record its highest total to date (305 for 5)\nwhile the stand for the second wicket (231) between Tendulkar and\nSidhu was India's best for all wickets. Under these\ncircumstances, Tendulkar, the trusted lieutenant; was already being\nperceived as the de facto captain with Azhar often letting him set the\nfield and handle the bowling change. Azhar's batting form was in\ntatters too, and the story goes that Tend ulkar virtually led him by the\nhand to the dressing room door in Sharjah when India recorded their\nrare triumph over their arch-rivals.\nBut his deputy's faith was repaid when the captain smashed 29\n(remember, India won by 28 runs) from ten balls, including 24 from\nthe last over bowled by Ata-ur-Rehman. It appeared to be only\na matter of time-and not much at that-before he would be replaced\nin Indian cricket's hot seat by the man who could seemingly do no\nV.\nTendulkar had made his first Test century at Old Trafford on the 1990\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n145\n\n\ftour of England. Now India returned for three Tests and three ODis. Though Nasser Hussain took the Man of the Match\naward for his maiden Test century, it was Tendulkar who stood out\nwith his 122 out of an Indian second-innings total of219. 'The real\nMan of the Match,' as Wisden Cricket Monthly aptly put it.\nThe rest of the Indian batting in both innings ended up in shambles,\nwith number nine Srinath being the only other to pass 50. Trailing by\n99 after the first innings, it would have been a total rout but for the\nIndian vice captain's ninth Test 100. With wickets falling in a heap\naround him, Tendulkar went for the bowling on a track that offered\nplenty ofhelp to the seamers.\nIt was a flawless innings with strokes all around the wicket. The bowlers\nwere treated with disdain as he hit 19 fours plus one six. With batsmen\non both sides struggling to cope with the uneven bounce and\nmovement off the pitch, this was a batting display that finally cemented\nhis place as the best in the world.\nTendulkar was ninth out when he skied a bouncer from outside off\nstump from Chris Lewis to Graham Thorpe, who caught it running\nbackwards at midwicket. Geoffrey Boycott summed up the way he\nrose head and shoulders above the rest of the Indian batting: 'The best\nway for India to beat England would be to have Sachin Tendulkar bat\nat number one, two, three, four and five.'\nThe Sportstar spoke to Tendulkar (29 June 1996) and asked him to\nrank his nine Test tons. He put the Edgbaston innings at number two,\nafter his 114 at Perth in 1992. At number three was the 111 against\n146\n\nSachin\n\n\fSouth Mrica at Johannesburg in the same year. At fourth spot was his\nmaiden century, 119 not out, against England at 0 ld Trafford in 1990.\nHis century at Sydney in 1992 was placed number five, followed by\n179 v West Indies (Mumbai, 1994); 165 v England (Chennai, 1993);\n142 v Sri Lanka (Lucknow, 1994) and finally, 104 not out, also against\nSri Lanka (Colomho sse, 1993).\nThe second Test at Lord's was drawn and was notable for the Test\ndebuts ofSourav Ganguly (131) and Rahul Dravid (95). Tendulkar\nwas bowled by a beauty from Lewis for 31. Ganguly followed up\nhis debut ton with 136 while Tendulkar came the closest he has ever\nbeen in his career to making two centuries in the same Test.\nHe also led India on the field for nearly the entire duration of the\nEngland innings. This is how he defended himself in an article\nin the Times if India nearly a year later (June 1997):\nBy the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour of 1996,\nmy name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season. Hence on the third day of the third Test\nmatch against England when captain Azharuddin reported unfit\nand I took charge of the team, my captaincy received special\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n147\n\n\fattention. Obviously, my moves were not\nappreciated by cricket lovers. Centuries scored by Atherton and Hussain reduced\nchances of our possible lead in the first innings considerably.\nRathore was unfit to bat; Manjrekar and Mongia were to open\nthe innings and were not in go_od form; Ganguly and Dravid\nwere playing only their second Test; Azharuddin was injured\nand was not in good form. I thought\none or two quick wickets could have changed the complexion\nof the game and the situation could have been reversed.\nThere was no doubt, however, that Tendulkar was streets ahead of\nall the other batsmen in the series, so it didn't come as a surprise when\nhe was chosen as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wtsden\nCricketers' Alrnanack (1997).\n\n148\n\nSachin.-Sachin Tendulkar\nIt was a virtual fait accompli following the England tour that Sachin\nTendulkar would be asked to take over the captaincy from Mohammad\nAzharuddin. The youngest in the history of Test\ncricket to take on the responsibility was 'Tiger' Pataudi. Mohan summed up the mood oflndian cricket followers:\n'The way forward for Indian cricket is to appoint Sachin Tendulkar\ncaptain now. His cricketing powers and his cricket faculties are in\nacute focus and there is no better time to hand over charge to a young\nman.'\nSure enough, on 8 August 1996, when the squad for the Singer Cup\none-day tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Sahara Cup 'Friendship' oneday series against Pakistan in Toronto was announced, Sachin was\nnamed captain.\nIn his debut series in Pakistan in 1989, Sachin's captain K. The question on everybody's mind was, could\nTendulkar, the batsman with the golden touch, transfer those skills\neffortlessly to the captaincy as well. This is what Sunil Gavaskar\nwrote in his column in the Sportstar (September 1996): 'My gut feeling\nis that the responsibility [of the captaincy] will see greater consistency\nfrom him and less throwing of the wicket to casual, experimental\nshots. And which one of us would complain\nto seeing more of his batting.\nThese doubts were dispelled-at least for the time being-upon\nTendulkar's debut as captain against Sri Lanka at the R. Though India were routed by\nnine wickets, Tendulkar marked the day with his ninth 001 ton and\nadded 129 runs for the third wicket with Azhar. It was the world\nchampions' first home game, five months after winning the title, and\nonce again it was the explosive opening pair of Jayasuriya and\nKaluwitharana that knocked the stuffing out of the Indian bowling.\nThe Indians made short work ofZimbabwe in their next match before\nbeing edged out by Australia in the last league game to decide who\nwould meet Sri Lanka in the final (the result was a repeat of the World\nCup final).\nIn his book Indian Cricket: The Captains-From Nayudu to Tendulkar,\nPartab Ramchand wrote about Tendulkar's first stint in charge:\nReally there can be nothing but praise for the manner in which\nTendulkar conducted himself in his various capacities as\ncaptain.\nFrom Sri Lanka it was straight to Toronto, where big-time cricket\nwould be played in Canada for the first time in the inaugural India v\nPakistan five-match one-day series.\nThough his captaincy was praised as positive, Tendulkar's batting fell\naway after he won the Man of the Match award for an unbeaten 89 in\nthe first match, which India won by eight wickets. Thereafter, he had\nscores of20, 2, 3 and 23 on sub-standard batting pitches which were\nseverely affected by incessant rain. Tendulkar reacted angrily. He defended his choice ofKambli by saying that he was\nthe best batsman for that wicket, and if Ganguly wasn't upset, why\nshould other people.' (Sportsworld,\nOctober 1996)\nThere would be a one-offTest for the inaugural Border-Gavaskar\nTrophy in New Delhi in October, followed by a three-Test home\nseries against South Mrica.\nIt was a new Indian team management that was in charge. Tendulkar\nfailed with the bat (10 and 0) in his first Test as captain. But everything\nelse went his way as India won by seven wickets, their first victory\nover Australia since 1981 in Melbourne. The state of the pitchwhich was to find its way into the CBI report into match-fixing four\nyears later-was defended by the new Indian captain. Tendulkar was in sparkling form and had three half-centuries in\nthe league phase.\nAnd it continued till last man Allan Donald was bowled. Tendulkar\nwas more than just active, he was a touch hyperactive, whether in\nadvising bowlers, handling the field placements with elaborate care,\nor even taking advice at on-field meetings.\n152\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut a year later, when the defeats outstripped the wins, the same style\n\nof captaincy was condemned as naive and over the t0p. It turned out to be the worst\nseries ofTendulkar's career with the bat to date (the one against New\nZealand the year before, at home, had been severely curtailed by rain),\nand fortunately for India, it still remains his worst. It was a Sachin who eschewed stroke play for\noccupation of the crease, in an echo ofhis mentor Gavaskar's prediction\nin his column. In the first innings, he batted for three and a half hours\nto hold the shaky innings together and top-scored in a total of237.Mohan in the Cricketer International (February 1997), at\nthe end of the series, 'The change at the helm effected during the year\nproved far reaching while also bringing in a twin benefit. Sachin\nTendulkar's captaincy, dynamic in most parts, and Mohammad\nAzharuddin's batting touch, a splendid recreation of all that is good\nabout Indian batsmanship, came about because the switch at the top\nwas made well in time.' Added Mohan, 'The most positive aspect to\nemerge from the series is that a young captain is prepared to play\npositive cricket. He may have hit a\nlow in the negative cricket he made his team play in the second Test in\nCalcutta but he came out of that mindset, in time to go for the series\nwin in Kanpur.'\nIt was the first time South Mrica had been beaten in a full series\nsince their return to Test cricket in 1992.\n\n154\n\nSachin\n.", "Batsman_1997": "-Dave Richardson\nThat old tag, 'Tigers at home, kittens abroad,' which has attached itself\nto the Indian team over the 1990s must have been at the back of\nSachin Tendulkar's mind as he prepared himself for his first tour as\ncaptain. India\ncrumbled to 100 and 66---the lowest ever score against South Mrica\nin Test cricket. Both innings together lasted a total of72.'\nAs has often happened in Tendulkar's career, the rival bowlers and\nfielders reserved their best for when he was at the crease. In the first\ninnings he was bowled by a beauty from Donald for 15. Donald felt the ball that got Sachin got was\none of the most lethal he had ever bowled in a Test match. Following\ntwo half-volleys which were driven regally to the boundary, Tendulkar\ngot one that pitched on a perfect length just cutside off stump. It\njagged back at such speed that the batsman was still in the process of\nbringing down his bat when the stump was sent cartwheeling in the\ndirection of the stunned wicketkeeper.\nIn the second innings, a sliced drive at Pollock was flying at great\nspeed and some distance from gully. But this time,\ntwo Indian batsmen produced a partnership fit for the gods, of which\nplayers on both sides still speak in awe.\nThe batsmen were Tcndulkar and Azhar, the stand was worth 222,\nthe runs came in 40 uvers and produced 175 minutes of some of the\nmost exhilarating batting seen in the history ofTest cricket. He had batted for just under three hours and raced to 115 off\n109 balls with 19 fours and a six. Tendulkar looked determined to\nreach his first double century.\nThe man with the best view was South African wicketkceper Dave\nRichardson and this is what he told me about Tendulkar's innings: 'I\ncan say it was the only occasion when I have honestly enjoyed an\nopposing player scoring a century. Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February 1997):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of 1997 the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n157\n\n\fsublime .

Tendulkar\nset the tone with a lightning 45 from 33 balls and his stand of 66 with\nDravid came at eight an over. Dravid carried the fight almost to the\nend with a superb 84 which won him the Man of the Match award.Mohan revealed Tendulkar's fatalistic state of mind midway\nthrough the tour in the Sportstar (1 March 1997): 'Sachin was speaking\nto a friend in his room that evening, asking him ifhe should consider\nstepping doyvn from the captaincy. There were already\nrumblings that the captain was unhappy with the team that he had\nbeen presented with for the five Tests and four oms for India's first\nvisit to the Caribbean since losing 3-0 in 1989. Indeed, 1997 would probably be the most hectic\never, with tours to South Mrica, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,\nToronto and Sharjah for Test and 001 tournaments, as well as home\ngames.

Tendulkar pointed out that this was\nthe first time an Indian touring side had escaped defeat in the opening\nTest of a series abroad since he made his debut in Pakistan in 1989.\nIf this series was to be a match up between Lara and Tendulkar, the\nWest Indian had certainly won the first round. He was at his best in\nthe first innings when he cracked a delightful 83 and followed it up\nwith 78. Tendulkar had scores of7 and 15 not out.\nPlaying in his fiftieth Test match, Tendulkar ground out one of his\nslowest batting displays after the West Indians had been dismissed for\n296 in their first innings. The Indian batting received a jolt when\nLaxman was out to Ambrose from the second ball of the innings.\nThereafter, it was safety-first tactics with Navjot Singh Sidhu-back\nfor the series after serving his sentence following the episode in\nEngland-recording the second slowest double century in Test cricket.\nDravid and Sidhu did the initial rescue act in their second wicket\nstand of171. But at no time did the batsmen seek to\nDefeat and Despair\n\n161\n\n\faccelerate the scoring.\nTendulkar had occupied the crease for 306 minutes when Walsh\nran him out for 88. Ambrose was the bowler and the only\nperson on the ground who did not think it was out was Australian\numpire Steve Randell. The pitch was sub-standard, the ball seamed all over the place\nand the uneven bounce caused all sorts of problems for the batsmen.\nLara led the West Indies for the first time, since Walsh was declared\nunfit. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for 298. The innings was held together by Shivnarine\nChanderpaul whose 137 not out was his first century following 13\n50s. For the second time in a row, the Indians gained the first innings\nlead, even if it was only 21 runs. Tendulkar played a cla~sy innings,\nand was eight short ofhis first century in the West Indies, when umpire\nLloyd Barker failed to call Ian Bishop for over-stepping.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of 170 runs. His batting was superb as he dispatched anything\nloose with outstanding shot selection.\nThe Indian seamers were back in action in the second innings to\n162\n\nSachin\n\n\frout West Indies for 140, their lowest score against India at home. Lara\ncounter-attacked to top score with 45 and then a last wicket stand\nworth 33 between Ambrose and Dillon pushed the target for India to\n120. In a mere three hours, the Indian batsmen had thrown away\nall the good work of the previous three days.\nLara manipulated his bowlers in a masterly manner with only\nAmbrose, Bishop and Rose (debutant Merv Dillon did not get to bowl)\nbeing entrusted with the task of bowling out the Indians. The score of\n81 was their lowest in the West Indies. Tendulkar\nwas done in by the bowler, rather than the pitch. Wtsden Cricket Monthly (May 1997) compared the\nperformances of the two 'superstar captains'. Tendulkar finished second in the\naverages behind Dravid with 289 runs at 57. 'I think it\nwas a combination of good bowling by the West Indies, bad batting by\nus nd a terrible track,' he said when asked 'What really went wrong at\nBarbados.'\n'It was very tough batting in the fourth innings. It was mainly the\nbatting which let us down.\nThere were situations when we would have lost early wickets\nand naturally I was required to hang in there . Since I became captain, it is only in South\nMrica that I have played on wickets where the ball was coming\non and once in Barbados .\n\n164\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe matter of team selection was also raised and here Tendulkar's\nwords were to haunt him soon, considering the storm just ahead. The four ODis that followed the Test series had more\nthan their fair share of controversy. Ganguly had crawled to 3 from 55\nballs in the second Test at Port-of-Spain when quick runs were needed.\nThis was apparently held against him by the tour management and\nhe found himself dropped for the fifth Test and the first ODI at Port-ofSpain.\nWest Indies easily won the opening game by eight wickets but\nwere stunned in the second at the same venue. But he sought to make amends with the bat and\n::.mashed nine fours in his 44 (43 balls), audaciously stepping out to\nthe fast bowlers, knowing full well how difficult the pitch was.\nGanguly was back for the second match. Kuruvilla and debutant David skittled out the West Indies\nfor 121, their lowest against India in an 001.\nDefeat and Despair\n\n165\n\n\fthe target was revised to 113 from 40 overs and the runs were promptly\nrattled off by openers Tendulkar (65 not out) and Ganguly from just\n23.\nChasing 250 for victory, the Indians were coasting with Ganguly\nand Dravid at the crease. It came down to 65 off\n68 balls with eight wickets in hand. Unbelievably, those wickets fell in\na heap for India to be all out for 231. Mter the good start, the batsmen\nsimply lashed out at the bowling when the target was well within\nreach. Even as he prepared to go out to the\ntoss, those on the scene reported that Tendulkar was forced to separate\na furious Madan Lal and Sidhu, with the coach accusing the batsman\nof'not wanting to play for the country'.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe most high-profile victim of the West Indies debacle was\nMohammad Azharuddin. It was not only his miserable form on the\ntour, but the way he threw away his wicket on more than one occasion\nthat forced the selectors to take the decision prior to the Independence\nCup four-nation tournament staged in India in the summer of 1997.\n'Let it be said that Sachin Tendulkar had it up to here,' wrote R. One\nknock, just one knock from the country's most experienced\ncricketer would have enabled the side to make history.\nTendulkar appeared to put all these cares behind him in India's\nopening match against New Zealand at Bangalore. The Kiwis had\nstunned Pakistan in the tournament opener at Mohali. New Zealand scored 220 for 9 and India made the target in\n42. The captain's 117 and his opening stand of 169 with\nGanguly destroyed the bowling, especially medium-pacer Heath Davis\nwho was belted for 4, 6, 4, 4 by Sachin in his third over.\nThe next match in Mumbai was a replay of the previous year's World\nCup semi-final and once again, it was Sri Lanka who came out on top.\nGanguly was bowled first ball by Vaas and then in the fourth over\ncame the breakthrough the Sri Lankans had sought so eagerly.\nThe key game of the tournament was inevitably the India-Pakistan\nclash at Chennai and it created a feast of runs and a world record. If\nPakistan came out on top by 35 runs, it was almost entirely thanks to\nopener Saeed Anwar's 194, which remains the highest score in an 001.\nPakistan's huge 327 for 5 was always going to be a challenge, and once\nTendulkar went early, this time for four, it was left to Rahul Dravid to\nkeep the match alive with his maiden century.\nThe simmering discontent between the Indian selectors and the\ncaptain exploded into the open when the team was announced for the\nAsia Cup to be held in Sri Lanka in July, the next stop in the crazy\nschedule that the Indians were subjected to in 1997.'\nA fortnight before this interview an extraordinary column under\n170\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's byline, syndicated by Sunil Gavaskar's Professional\nManagement Group, had appeared in the Times cflndia (28 June 1997).\nMumbai: By the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour\nof 1996, my name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season. Hence on the third day of the third Test\nmatch against England when captain Azharuddin reported unfit\nand I took charge of the team, my captaincy received special\nattention. Obviously, my moves were not\nappreciated by cricket lovers. Centuries scored by\nAtherton and Hussain reduced chances of our possible lead in\nthe first innings considerably.\nThis would have made India bat in their second innings rather\ntoo early, which could have created problems for us. Rathore\nwas unfit to bat; Manjrekar and Mongia were to open the\ninnings and were not in good form; Ganguly and Dravid were\nplaying only their second Test; Azharuddin was injured and\nwas not in good form. He was to bat only if needed. I thought\none or two quick wickets could have changed the complexion\nof the game and the situation could have been reversed.\nI entered the test arena in 1989 and today when I am at the\nhelm, I find most of the senior players Kapil Dev, Dilip\nConfrontation\n\n171\n\n\fVengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Manoj\nPrabhakar and Kiran More with whom I played at the start of\nmy career, have left the scene. Two experienced batsmen, Sidhu\nand Manjrekar, have been in and out of the side for some reason\nor the other.\nDuring the last year, the Indian team, barring Mohd. Rathore, Ganguly, Dravid,\nPrasad and Joshi had played hardly two to three Test matches.\nFurther, Sidhu was not in the team until the tour of the West\nIndies. In the circumstances, Raman who had not played Test\ncricket for a long time, opened the innings in South Africa.\nSrinath's injury and subsequent return to India at the start of\nthe West Indies tour was a big blow to India's bowling attack.\nThe Test season began with victory in the solitary Test match\nagainst Australia; my first Test match as captain.\nAt 65 runs for the loss offour wickets and 170 runs needed to\nwin, victory seemed within their reach. In their second innings South Africa were\nall out for a meagre 1OS runs. The\n172\n\nSachin\n\n\fwicket happened to be the slowest of all the wickets that we\ncame across on that tour. Incidentally the wicket at Durban for the first Test\nwas perhaps the fastest that I have ever played on. foreign wickets and perform to the best\nof their ability at the beginning of the tour. At the end of the day South\nMrica had lost eight wickets, but had managed to save the game.\n\\Vhen we went to the West Indies, Srinath had to leave the\nteam because of a shoulder injury. For a five Test series we were\nleft with only two specialist bowlers in Prasad and Kumble.\nBut at the end of the third day the wicket had deteriorated\nconsiderably and the experts like Sunil Gavaskar, Geoff Boycott\nand Michael Holding were unanimous in their opinion, even\nbefore our innings started, that it was going to be very difficult\nto score those runs. The beginning of our second innings was\ngoing to be of the utmost importance.\nSidhu's wicket confirmed our doubts about the deteriorating\npitch. I will not blame the wicket entirely, but some accurate\nbowling, excellent field placing, and to some extent bad batting\ncontributed to our loss. I remember a similar situation when in\n1982 one of the strongest batting line-ups ofan Australian team\ncomprising Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Allan Border, Kim\nHughes, Graeme Wood, John Dyson and Rodney Marsh, could\nnot achieve a target of only 129 runs against India on a bad\nMelbourne wicket.\nEven the 1996 World Cup winning Sri Lankan team has\ndeveloped into a winning combination over a period of time\nand has reached such heights in one-day cricket only recently\nand in Test cricket too their present performances indicate that\n174\n\nSachin\n\n\fthey are a side to reckon with. I happened to witness his batting during\nSri Lanka's tour of India in 1993-94. He was not known to\nmany as a batsman of the calibre as he is known today. Also he\nused to bat lower down in the middle order. By this time, the meJia\nwas full of match-fixing, bookies and bribery revelations and by the\ntime the Indians landed in Colombo, former Pakistan captain Rashid\nLatif had named names in an interview from London.\nTendulkar was in form in the two Tests, scoring 143 in the first and\n139 in the first innings of the second. But all other feats were\novershadowed by Sri Lanka's world record total of952 for 6 wickets in\nthe first Test at the R. Roshan Mahanama (225)\nand Sanath Jayasuriya (340) broke all partnership records for Test\ncricket with their second wicket stand of576 runs. The Indian bowling,\nstill without Srinath, had run out of answers. Indian cricket was at a\npretty low ebb.\nIronically, the first to be axed was not a cricketer, but a journalist. Pakistan too were without their two strike\nbowlers, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. They got him 15 wickets,\nincluding two in the third match which was declared a 'no-result' due\nto rain.\nAdded to these wickets was Ganguly's total of222 runs, more than\nenough to make him the obvious choice for Man of the Series.\nThe wickets were seamer friendly, and the batsmen struggled in\nthe first four matches. His team was swept\naside in the first four matches, his own form plummeted, there were\nnon-cricketing problems for his team as well, and at the end of the\ntournament he was promptly sacked as captain. For once, India came\nout on top despite Tendulkar not being among the runs. 'As long as the team performs\nwell and wins matches, I don't worry about my batting. The Wills Challenge Cup series of three matches was the first\ntime since his debut in 1989 that Tendulkar was playing in Pakistan. Beaten by five wickets in the first ODI\nat Hyderabad (Sind), India came storming h::tck to win the second at\nKarachi in the last over. Ganguly once again did the star\nturn with 89 before Rajesh Chauhan hit Saqlain Mushtaq for a six in\nthe last over to make it safe for India. This time, all the three\nTests they played in India were drawn. So was the ODI series, played on\nIndia's return from Sharjah. India won the first at Guwahati by se~\u00b7en\nwickets and lost the third at Margao by five. This meant that India had played 12 Tests Uust three at home)\nin 1997 without a single victory, though at Mumbai in the third Test\nagainst Sri Lanka they were thwarted by rain when well on top, as had\nhappened earlier in the year in South Mrica.\naffecting his batting was nonsense, at least in Test matches. The ODI figures for the year, though, did show a\ndecline-1011 runs in 39 matches at 30. India hit the depths, beaten by England (seven runs),\nPakistan (four wickets) and West Indies (41 runs). To add to his\nhumiliation by the selectors, Tendulkar had also now been ordered to\nbat lower down the order. The nadir was reached in the third and final match against\nthe West Indies. Chasing229 for 6, India crumbled to 188. His running between the wickets\nshocked everybody and it was no surprise when he was run out for\nfour, going for a non-existent second run.self out of the Indian team.\n\n180\n\nSachin.", "Batsman_1998": "-Allan Donald\nThe Mccv Rest of the World match at Lord's on 18July 1998was held\nto commemorate Dr W.

'Perhaps a hundred years from now\nMCC will stage a Tendulkar Memorial match.'\nFor an Indian cricketer to play for his country for nearly a decade and\nnot be involved in a major controversy, is one more 'record' Tendulkar\ncould have claimed. Except for a publicity-hungry politician-cumcareer-sports-oflicial who attempted to tarnish his reputation and\nimplied motives to him that had the cricketing fraternity up in arms.\nThe success of cricket and the amount of coverage it gets in the\nmedia has always been a sore point with those representing other\nsports, who react with a mixture of envy, awe and resentment. That one player, naturally, was Sachin\nTendulkar. Ajay Jadeja (the captain), Robin Singh and Ani)\nKumble were the other star players in the squad. There\nwas an even bigger shock in the next game against Canada, with the\nbest batsman in the world out for two, the victim of an unknown 35On Top of the World\n\n215\n\n\fyear-old from Granada by the name ofDavisJoseph.\nThe last league match against Australia was a do-or-die game for\nIndia. Australia were struggling at 84 for 5 before skipper Steve Waugh\nscored a century, an innings which he said was his 'most satisfYing' in\none-day cricket-though it will not be in the record books. This time\nTendulkar scored 45 before he fell to Damien Fleming. Indian cricket had striven in\n1998 to overcome the traumas of the year before.\nSachin landed in Toronto after 20 overs of the fourth game had\nbeen bowled. Still jet-lagged from his marathon flight, he managed to crack\n77 in India's total of 256 for 9 in the fifth and final match; skipper\nAzhar top-scored with 101.'\n216\n\nSachin\n\n\fStraight from Toronto, it was off to Zimbabwe for the weary Indians. Medium-pacer Neil Johnson\non his debut got Tendulkar in both innings, for 34 and 7. And at Bulawayo in the opening\ngame, Tendulkar scored his eighteenth ODI century to overtake West\nIndian opener Desmond Haynes' world record. Tendulkar's eighteenth came four years\nafter his first in Colombo in 1994. But it took\nSachin 46 innings (in his hundred and ninety-eighth om) fewer than\nthe West Indian and that is the true barometer. Ten of Tendulkar's\ntons had come abroad and the rest at home. It meant that Indian\nbatsmen now held the record for most centuries in Tests (34 by Sunil\nGavaskar) and oms. Sachin's 127 not out in India's eight-wicket win\nwas his sixth of the year, and there would be more to follow. South Mrica\nlifted the Wills Trophy, beating the West Indies by four wickets in the\nfinal. Tendulkar left his mark on the tournament in the third quarterfinal where India faced Australia, this time minus Warne and McGrath. Then Tendulkar\nand Dravid began the rebuilding and Jadeja weighed in with 71 to\ntake India past the 300-run mark. Tendulkar was awesome. By the\ntime he was smartly run out for 141 from 127 balls, he had smashed\n13 fours and three sixes and the Indian total of307 for 8 was a formidable\none. They were 145 for 2 when Tendulkar\nwas tossed the ball and started conjuring up wickets with his assortment\nof 'offies' and 'leggies'. He accounted for Steve Waugh, caught ancl\nOn Top of the World\n\n217\n\n\fbowled, and then added Michael I3evan, Damien Martyn and Brad\nYoung to his bag. Only Viv Richards\nhas scored a century and taken five wickets in an ODI. Tendulkar came\npretty close, and the Australians were all out for 263.'\nThe innings also took Sachin past his own record for most ODI\nruns in a year. In 1996 he had 1611 in 32 matches. Now in 1998, in 34\nmatches (33 innings, four not out) he would compile 1894 runs at\n65.\"t match, the\nsemi-final against the West Indies, in which they were beaten by six\nwickets with Tendulkar out at eight. Despite both their prolific\nopeners falling cheaply, India won their opening match against the\nSri Lankans by three wickets. Tendulkar notched up his twentieth century\nagainst Zimbabwe for a grand total of 36 centuries in international\ncricket, taking him past Sunil Gavaskar, Viv Richards and Desmond\nHaynes, all of whom had a combined Test and ODI total of35 centuries. Chasing a\nmeagre total of205 for 7, the Indian batsmen were rocked by a searing\nspell from the dreadlocked fast bowler, in which he had the prize\nscalps of Ganguly, Tend ulkar, Dravid and Jadeja-the cream of the\ncrop. Tendulkar was surprised by one that took off nastily and had\nhim groping with his bat held high, to be caught by Grant Flower for\n11. It was Olonga's first match of the tournament and the fact that he\n218\n\nSachin\n\n\fmade a master like Tendulkar look uncomfortable at the crease was\nthe talking point when the two teams met in the final 48 hours later. He has\nalways taken it as a personal challenge to go after the best bowler in the\nopposition, as in the case of McGrath and Warne.\nAnd perhaps for the first time in a tournament, without the loss of a\nsingle wicket. It was India's fifth tournament title of the year in their\nrecord-breaking fortieth ODI in 1998. They also won the ODI series in\nZimbabwe.\nTendulkar's 124 not out was virtually double that of his partner\nGanguly's contribution (63), a measure ofhis total domination at the\ncrease. Tendulkar's century\nwas his fastest (and the fourth fastest of all), from 71 balls, and had a\nfi. It was close to the Indian\nrecord held by Azhar (62 balls). The stand with Ganguly fetched 112 in the\nfirst 15 overs as Tendulkar went hell for leather after a dropped catch\nwhen he was on 53, offleg-spinner Paul Strang who was carted for 45\nruns from his five overs. Forty-one were smashed from Olonga's first\nfour overs, 28 of which came from Tendulkar's bat. Then he pulled the hapless\nbowler from outside off stump.\nTendulkar had another world record to his credit-32 Man of the\nMatch awards in 207 matches, against 31 in 187 by Viv Richards. 'I\ndecided to enjoy my batting. 'Olonga is an\ninternational bowler. He can bowl some good deliveries and he got\nOn Top of the World\n\n219\n\n\fmy wicket. Mter the first\nTest had been completely washed out, New Zealand won the second\nat Wellington by four wickets, despite centuries by Azhar and\nTendulkar.\nFollowing his golden year, Tendulkar made an inauspicious start\nto 1999, out for a duck in the first 001 at Taupo.\n\n220\n\nSachin\n.", "Batsman_1999": "-Ajit Wadekar\n1\\.lways bat first, Azhar, always bat first,' was Bishan Singh Bedi's\nanguished cry as he watched, on television, the Indian captain put\nAustralia in at the start oflndia's first Super Six match on 4 June.\nNothing is what it seems in Indian cricket.

India's first match on 23 August saw them trounced by\neight wickets by the Aussies. Four\nIndian batsmen were run out, including the 'new' captain for 37. On the morning of28 August,\nwhen India were to take on Australia again, the captain awoke with a\nstiff back and ruled himself out of the match.\nTend ulkar returned for the final league match, the only one which\nIndia would win. The match was marked by his\n242\n\nSachin\n\n\ftwenty-third century and though India won by 23 runs, they were\nedged out of a place in the final on the net run rate. Team doctor Ravinder Chadha treated him on the field\nafter the fall of opener Ramesh's wicket. The theories included excessive\ncricket, hot and humid conditions, the remarkably heavy bat\nTendulkar wielded, even the position of his feet while making certain\nstrokes.\nNext stop for the team was the Singapore Challenge against\nZimbabwe and the West Indies. Tendulkar (85) picked up another\nMan of the Match award against Zimbabwe, and the win was enough\nto ensure that India would meet the West Indies in the final. Tendulkar\nrested himself the next day for the inconsequential league match\nagainst the twice former world champions, and Ganguly led for the\nfirst time. Tendulkar was out without scoring, from the sixth ball\nof the match bowled by Courtney Walsh, who had taken his wicket in\nthe abandoned final, too. But India was without\nthe services of their captain, who decided instead to fly to Adelaide to\nhave his back examined by Dr Peter Barnes, a specialist at the Australian\nReluctant Messiah\n\n243\n\n\fCricket Academy. It would be an estimated three to four weeks\nbefore he could return to cricket. As an irritated Sachin was to say (Sportstar, 19 February 2001):\nWhoever I met asked the same question, 'How is your back. Tendulkar missed not only the DMC Cup in\nToronto (India, led by Ganguly, beat the West Indies 2-1), but also the\nLG Cup in Nairobi, where Ajay Jadeja was captain and India lost in the\nfinal to South Africa.\n\n244\n\nSachin.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nBy October 1999, Sachin Tendulkar was back in the team after his\nenforced break. His first Test series was at home against New Zealand,\na relatively soft start to his second innings as captain-or should one\nsay, follow-on. Kapil Dev had been with\nTendulkar in his debut series, in Pakistan in 1989, and the two were\nknown to be close.\nOn a slightly damp pitch at Mohali, Stephen Fleming won the\ntoss, put India into bat and shot them out for a shocking 83 in a mere\n27 overs. Tendulkar ( 18) was one of only three batsmen to reach double\nfigures.Ramesh in the second innings. This\ntime, the top five all crossed 50 and two reached double figuresRahul Dravid and the captain himself At times, it appeared Tendulkar\nwas batting from memory. But an\nIndian victory was duly delivered by the spin bowlers in the next Test\nat Kanpur. India coasted to victory by eight wickets, with the captain\nhimself rattling off 44 not out, from 39 balls, in the second innings of\n83 for2.\nThe third and final Test at Ahmedabad should have been a triumph\nfor both Tendulkar and the team. Instead, after scoring his first Test\ndouble century in a decade, Tendulkar courted controversy by his\nrefusal to enforce a follow-on after leading by 275 runs.\nSachin had recorded his first double century in first-class cricket\nin 1998, for Mumbai against the touring Australians. But, after all the pain and trauma resulting from his back\ninjury, it was indeed a sweet way to announce to the world of cricket\nthat he was back at his best.Ramesh\nout for 110and Tendulkar batting on 104. The 281 stand with Tendulkar for the fourth wicket was an Indian\nrecord and the team declared at 583 for 7. It was\n246\n\nSachin\n\n\fanother psychological breakthrough, overtaking his previous highest\nof179 against the West Indies at Nagpur in 1994.\nThis was the same ground where Sunil Gavaskar became the first to\nreach 10,000 runs and where Kapil Dev broke Sir Richard Hadlee's\nworld Test wicket record.'\nSunil Gavaskar's Indian record of236 not out was in sight when\nTendulkar was dismissed by a brilliant catch, shortly after tea on the\nsecond day. The\nbatsman lingered and waited for the umpire's decision as he was not\nsure the ball had carried to the fielder. But India batted again in the second innings, finally\ndeclaring on 148 for 5. Viswanath in the Hindu (2 November 1999).com (3\nNovember 1999): 'The last thing Test cricket needs is this approach\nby the Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar.' Inexplicably,\none of the bowlers who had apparently demanded a break, Javagal\nSrinath (who bowled 35 overs in the first innings) came out to bat in\nthe second innings and hung around for nearly half an hour to score\n19 not out. Both he and the other not-out batsman, Jadeja, were\nconstantly looking in the direction of the pavilion for the captain to\ncall them in.\nHe did, eventually, after the second innings had consumed 32 overs,\nleaving the Indians with only 13 overs to have a go at their opponents\non the fourth evening. He justified his strategy in an interview with\nVijay Lokapally (Spottstar, 20 November 1999):\nJust spare a thought for the bowlers.\nTendulkar finished the series with a 100-plus average and got\nanother chance to gorge himself on the mediocre Kiwi attack in the\none-day series that followed.\nNew Zealand had thrashed the Indian bowlers 349 for 9 in the first\nmatch at Rajkot-the highest 001 total on Indian soil. India's 376 for 2 was the sewnd highest ODI total\nof all time and the stand of 331 for the second wicket in 46 overs\n248\n\nSachin\n\n\fbetween Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar was the biggest ever partnership.\nGanguly missed out on the run riot when bowler Shayne O'Connor\ndeflected Tendulkar's firm push on to the non-striker's stumps, with\nthe batsman out of his ground, in the second over. Tendulkar carried\nhis bat, in the process erasing Ganguly's previous Indian highest of\n183 against Sri Lanka in the 1999 World Cup. He was on 182 when Chris\nCairns bowled the last over and there was a huge buzz around the\nground. It was notto be, though the Indian record was his. Sachin agreed after the innings that his shot selection had\nchanged. Tomorrow, someone may break the record\nbut people would remember me for the contribution I made in\nwinning the match for India.\nFor Tendulkar and his men, the real test was round the corner in\nAustralia, where the world Test and ODI champions were waiting.", "Batsman_2000": "-Brett Lee\nThe team for Australia generated the usual debate and criticism, most\nof it centred un the exclusion of Mohammad Azharuddin and Nayan\nMongia. 'Mongia was thought to be a self-centred cricketer, which\ncould be debated and Azharuddin was obviously held in poor esteem\nby the new coach and also skipper Tendulkar. To be sidelined without\na proper trial was not the best way to treat a senior cricketer like\nAzharuddin,' wrote Vijay Lokapally in the Sportstar (20 November\n1999). By now, both the players were under a cloud of suspicion over\ntheir role in corrupt cricket practices. And Mongia's crazy shot in the\nclosing stages of the Chennai Test against Pakistan was still, no doubt,\nfresh in his batting partner's mind. Tendulkar would also tell the CB. Prasad when it was thought\nhe might not be fit for the second Test. He played in one match (against\nTasmania), hung around for a while and then returned to India\ndespondent, even as Prasad made a miraculous recovery. Tendulkar had made a huge impact on his previous tour\nDown Under in 1991-92, with his brilliant centuries at Sydney and\nPerth, while still a teenager. The intervening years had seen him mature\ninto the world's greatest batsman and Australians were delighted as\nwell by the stamp of approval accorded to the Indian master from their\nvery own living legend, Sir Don Bradman.\n'Twice in that match, Darrell Hair played the headmaster to\nperfection, admonishing the tourists as if they were errant children\ncaught smoking in a sehoul toilet,' wrote Harsha Bhogle in Wisden\nCricketers' Almanack Australia (2000-01 ).\nThe high esteem in which Tendulkar is held by Australian cricket\nfollowers was best illustrated when Sachin was introduced to Sachin\nVoigt at the Adelaide Oval, venue of the first Test. 'Dear Sachin, keep smiling, Sachin\nTendulkar,' Tendulkar signed on the mini-bat presented by his young\nnamesake who had waited patiently for three hours to meet his hero. It did not help matters\nthat Tendulkar was the victim, in both innings, of hotly debated\ndecisions handed out by Australian umpire Daryl Harper, which only\nadded to the growing suspicion that he was being unfairly targeted.\nReplying to Australia's 441, the Indians were 123 for 4 at close on the\nsecond day, with Tendulkar and Ganguly both on 12. The skirmish\nbetween McGrath and Tendulkar on the second evening had been\nbrief but captivating. In their only previous meeting in a Test match,\nthe Australian speedster had bowled the Indian captain for a duck in\nNew Delhi in 1996. Now Tendulkar, coming in at a shockingly low\nnumber five in the order, was in a rare defensive mood as he batted for\n89 minutes and 69 balls for 12 runs. Time and again, McGrath tested\nhim outside off stump, and each time the batsman just waved his bat\naway and let the ball through to the keeper.\nHe hit the first three deliveries of the second over from fast bowler\nMichael Kasprowicz to the boundary-an on drive, a flick to square\nleg and a cover drive. With Ganguly for company, 92 runs were added\nin 22 overs. Tendulkar's 49 came from 64 balls and he was just getting\ninto his stride when he was adjudged to have been caught bat and pad\nat short leg offWarne for 61. The score was-215 for 5, and with the wind taken out of the\nIndian sails, the innings folded up for 285.\n'The Indians had all along feared this kind of situation and when\nyour best batsman becomes a sort of marked man it becomes tough on\nthe team. If the Tendulkar episode took away the sheen from the Aussie\nvictory the fault lay with the umpire. But before that, Tendulkar enthralled one and all with\nhis third century Down Under and his fifth against Australia in 11\nTests. Mter Australia once again crossed 400 in their first innings, India\nwere struggling at 235 for 9 at the end of the third day, with Tendulkar\nholding the batting together with his twenty-second Test century. But\nit was fast bowler Brett Lee, who grabbed five wickets on Test debut,\nwho captured most of the headlines. Lee bowled lightning quick and\nDebacle Down Under\n\n253\n\n\fonly Tendulkar-now batting at number four-managed to defy his\nhostile pace.\nIt appeared as if there was a game within the game going on in the\nmiddle: Tendulkar v Australia.'\nThere was too, a little gem of an innings when India batted to save\nthe Test the second time round. As the world celebrated the dawn of the new\nmillennium, Tendulkar must have looked back at 1999 with decidedly\nmixed feelings: His father's death, India's disappointing World Cup\nperformance, his back worries, the captaincy drama and the miseries\nin Australia .\nAustralia completed a 3-0 whitewash with victory by an innings\nand 141 runs injust three days in the third and final Test at Sydney,\nthe first Test of the year 2000. There was a brief flash of brilliance in\nTendulkar's first-innings 45 as he once again duelled with McGrath.\nHe took 14 runs otT one over from the fast bowler before being given\nout lbw for 45, a shocking decision by Zimbabwean umpire Ian\nRobinson. McGrath sent the batsman on his way with a crude gesture\nand a mouthful of abuse, and was lucky to get just a slap on the wrist\nfrom match referee Ranjan Madugalle. It was the third ti:ne in five\ninnings that Tendulkar had got the short end of the stick from the\numpires. Laxman in the second\ninnings, India's was a lost cause.\n254\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's disappointment at the end of the Test was heightened\nby anger over the behaviour of the two umpires on the final day.\nBut the umpires ignored Tendulkar's plea to step in. At the post-match\npress conference, Man of the Series Tendulkarwas livid. Tendulkar was asked\nafter the series ifhe felt the umpires had targeted him, but he refused\nto be drawn, saying it was probably a coincidence. Coward, a man with a deep affection for\nIndian cricket and cricketers, wrote an impassioned open letter to\nTendulkar in the Weekend Australian (8-9 January 2000).\nAs the game's pre-eminent batsman and your country's\ncaptain you are in a priceless position to make a difference.\nSachin, you are recognized throughout the cricket world as a\nthoughtful, self-effacing, intelligent young man of great\nintegrity and quiet dignity. after much too long, Australian cricket wants to know more\nabout India and Indian cricket and cricketers.\nSachin, you are in a powerful position.\nWriting in 2002 (Sportstar, 12 January 2002), Sunil Gavaskar made\na similar point:\nWhen he was captain of the team to Australia he had the media\n256\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere looking for a comment or two about how to give the\ngame a new direction.' Perhaps Tendulkar was taking shelter under\nthe ICC Code of Conduct regarding comments, but there comes\na time when the good of cricket counts before anything else\nand one has to stick one's neck out for the betterment of the\ngame. He had just one substantial innings, 93 against Pakistan at\nHobart, where India lost by 32 runs.\nIn that match in Perth, Tendulkar received yet another terrible\ndecision, given out caught behind offWaqar Younis by umpire Simon\nTaufel for 17.-Sachin Tendulkar\nWas Sachin Tendulkar's opposition to the inclusion of Mohammad\nAzharuddin based on sound reasoning, or was it another aspect of his\noften stubborn attitude towards the selectors.\nHere Tendulkar got his way, with Mumbai teammate Sameer\nDighe flying out to replace the disappointing M. Prasad behind\nthe stumps. Considering the batting failures in the Tests, there were\nalso strong indications that Azhar would he part of the one-day team.\nThe second day of the tour-opening match of the South African\n\n\fteam against the Board President's XI at the Brabourne Stadium in\nMumbai was on 20 February 2000. It was also the day the selectors\nwould announce the team for the first Test at Mumbai's Wankhede\nStadium, starting in four days' time. At the beginning of\nthe season when Mr Wadekar, the then chairman of the\nselection committee, met vvith me and offered me the captaincy,\nI showed my reluctance to accept the job as I felt that I was not\nmentally prepared at that time. Perhaps a loose understanding was reached between\nTendulkar, Ganguly andJadeja at the World Cup, that whoever was\nmade captain would resign if Mohammad Azharuddin was picked;\nperhaps Tendulkar arrived with two letters in his pocket for the selection\nmeeting, one with the team he wanted, the other his resignation. The third theory\nwas that Tendulkar decided to quit after the Test series so that his\nconfidant Jadeja could take over as captain since India were to play\nonly one-day cricket till November. As Sanjay Manjrekar\ncommented: '[Sachin] has perfect timing when it comes to batting,\nbut don't expect him to be perfect at everything. I think the player\nTendulkar is more etTective than the captain-player Tendulkar.com after Ganguly was eventually appointed to\nsucceed Tendulkar, this is how Wadekar assessed the man on whose\nshoulders he had thrust the captaincy just eight months earlier:\nI'm convinced that Sachin will never lead the Indian side in\nfuture.\nSachin also leads from the front. He can crush any attack in the\nworld with his batting on any wicket. I do not think his batting gets affected by captaincy.\nA survey of former players, including former captains Bishan Singh\nBedi, K.\nThis is what he had to say in Cricket Talk (30 March 2000):\n\nQ: Why did you surrender the captaincy so suddenly. When Ajit Wadekar came to my house\n262\n\nSachin\n\n\fat the start of the season last year, I told him that I was not\ninterested in the job. They\nlost the first at Mumbai by four wickets and the second at Bangalore\nby an innings and 71 runs.\nTendulkar was the only batsman to look comfortable on a bowlerfriendly wicket at Mumbai. His 97 in the first innings was the highest\nscore in the match by far. The Indian captain also picked up\nStepping Down\n\n263\n\n\fhis best Test bowling analysis of 3 for 10 from five overs as South\nMrica collapsed for 176 and conceded a lead of 49.\nThe defeat meant Tendulkar had lost five Tests in a row as captain.\nIt was shattering for such a proud man and Indian cricket was at one of\nits lowest ebbs. At virtually\nthe same time, in the West Indies, Brian Lara stepped down from the\ncaptaincy with a similar record of six won, two drawn and ten lost.\nGanguly took over for the one-day series which India won 3-2. What an\nirony then, that he should find himself exiled from the world of cricket.\nMter failing in the first three oms, Tendulkar came good with his\ntwenty-fifth ton at Baroda as India won by four wickets to take an\nunbeatable 3-1lead in the series. He followed it up with 93 in the fifth\nand final match at N agpur. India recorded a rare win over\nPakistan in the first round but lost the second match, as well as both\n264\n\nSachin\n\n\fmatches against South Africa, and without a single major contribution\nfrom its top batsman, failed to make it to the final. This followed Prabhakar naming Kapil as the\nman who, he claimed, had offered him a bribe to throw a match in Sri\nLanka in 1994. Tendulkar's 93\nagainst Sri Lanka was made out of a total of205, chasing a target of\n277. Young guns Yuvraj\nSingh and Zaheer Khan were the batting and bowling heroes. Ganguly\nand Tendulkar gave the innings a flying start with a rapid stand of 66\nruns. Tendulkar (38) decided to take on McGrath and not only with\nhis bat. He hammered the world's leading fast bowler, prompting a\nfrustrated McGrath to unleash his usual string of abuse. He even\noffensively demonstrated to Tendulkar how to play a stroke. In McGrath's first over Tendulkar tried to take one\nfrom outside off and hit over mid wicket. The ball flared off the bat and\nsoared with immense power over a stunned Gillespie at third man, for\nan amazing six.\nIn the next over Sachin danced down the wicket as if he were\nfacing an innocuous off-spinner, picked McGrath on the rise, and\nsmashed him over long off for six. There was one more six off McGrath before\nLee sent Sachin back.\nIt was for only the second time in his career that Sachin had lost\nhis cool on the field. It was a very different Tendulkar we saw\nthat day .\nA: That particular innings, I felt the wicket had a lot ofbounce\nand dampness. McGrath didn't have a\nmid-on to start with. This time\nGanguly carried his bat for 141 while Tendulkar's contribution was\n39. Tendulkar\nwas run out after a mix-up, for 69.\nJust five days later, India and Sri Lanka were playing the opening\nmatch of the Coca-Cola tri-series (with Zimbabwe) in Sharjah and\nTendulkar was back in century mode. 71 runs came\nfrom singles this time, as the rest of the batting crumbled around him. So, Sachin was forced to change his style,\nworking the ball around the field, nudging behind square and\ndropping the ball short of fielders, and scampering for singles. He\nwon the Man of the Match award once again, but it was the Sri Lankans\nwho came out on top by five wickets. Followingjayasuriya's\nhuge 189, the Indian batting crashed to their lowest total of 54 all out.-Sachin Tendulkar\nafter being stranded on 194 in the Multan Test match.\nSachin Tendulkar's poor run ofTest match form from the disastrous\ntour to New Zealand carried on when the Kiwis visited India in October\n2003.\nScores of8, 7, 55 and 1 in the two Tests against New Zealand were\nfollowed by a splendid run in the ODI tri-series with Australia and\nNew Zealand.\nIndia under Tendulkar's captaincy had been whitewashed 3-0\nwhen they last toured Australia in 1999-2000. But it was a different\nteam and a different captain four years later when India were back\nDown Under for another gripping Test series.\n\n\fIt was at Sydney, where he had made such an impact as a teenager\non his first visit in 1991-92, that Tendulkar finally came out of his\nTest match slump.\nRight through the series he had been overshadowed by the\nawesome form ofDravid, Laxman, Sehwag and Ganguly with even\nrookie Aakash Chopra being more consistent. In the third Test at\nMelbourne he was even shielded by Ganguly in the second innings,\ncoming in at number five.\nNow at Sydney he finally reached three figures for the first time\nsince the Kolkata Test against the West Indies in November 2002seven Tests without a century. Of his 241 not out, 176 came\non the on-side in an innings stretching to over 10 hours, his longestever stint at the crease.\nJust for good measure he added 60 not out in the second innings to\nclimb to third in the averages behind the in-form Dravid and\nLaxman-but 301 of his 383 runs from his seven innings had come in\nthe final Test. Tendulkar's scores of27\nand 8 meant he had failed once again to rise to the big occasion. For the first time in over 50 years India won a Test match\n(and series) in Pakistan, and the 001 series too for good measure.\nTendulkar was the only player in the touring side to have played a\nTest match in Pakistan, having made his debut there in 1989.\nHis major contribution in the 001 series was a fabulous 141 in a\nlosing cause in the third match at Rawalpindi, the first 001 century by\nan Indian batsman in Pakistan.\n332\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe Indian batting was in form in the first Test at Multan, carrying\non from where they had left off at Sydney just a couple of months\nearlier.\nSehwag became the first Indian cricketer to score a Test triple\ncentury, adding 336 for the third wicket with Tendulkar. The talking\npoint of the match was not only Sehwag's feat and India's win by an\ninnings and 52 runs but Tendulkar's public reaction to stand-in captain\nRahul Dravid's declaration with his score on 194. It was his 33rd Test century, placing him just one\nbehind the world record held by Sunil Gavaskar.\nIt was fitting then that the final Pakistani batsman to fall in the\nthird and final Test at Rawalpindi should have been caught by captain\nGanguly off the bowling ofTendulkar. Kumble and\nTendulkar surviving from that era. And finally after nearly a\ndecade of carrying the Indian batting on his shoulders, the burden\nand pressures had eased for Tendulkar with Laxman, Dravid and\nSehwag emerging as world-class batsmen.", "Batsman_2001": "Foot Fault\n\nThere cannot be another Sachin Tendulkar.-Virender Sehwag\n\nAfter the excitement of the home series against Australia, it was time\nfor the Indians to hit the road again. The first Test at Bulawayo\nwas won by the visitors by eight wickets, their first victory outside\nAsia since beating England 2-0 in 1986. Sachin Tendulkar top-scored\nwith 74 in India's first innings of318. Tendulkar (36)\nhit the winning runs. It was a special moment, for only twice before in\nhis career had India won abroad-in Colombo in 1993 and in Dhaka\nin 2000. Now the batting crumbled in\nboth innings.\nZimbabwe swept home by four wickets and India were once again\ndenied series victory on foreign soil. From an individual point-ofview, the one-day tri-series that followed (with the West Indies) was a\ntriumph for Tendulkar. His century came in the last round-robin game against\nthe West Indies at Harare, on 4 July, after India had ensured that they\nwould be in the final.1 overs) on 122, as India won by four wickets. It was Tendulkar's\ndismissal at the hands of Man of the Match Corey Collymore that\nproved vital once again. In it, Sachin had discussed the sensitive\nissue of captaincy.'\nHe then sought to dispel suggestions that the burden of captaincy had\nhampered his batting in the past and said his first double century\ncame when he was captain. 'Only, I think when I was captain, we\nplayed South Africa, West Indies and Australia .'\nNaturally, all the headlines focussed on his comments on the\ncaptaincy, a never-ending debate in Indian cricket circles. Were\nthey cricketing reasons or personal. In a rare critique of Tendulkar, he\ncame down on him for throwing away his wicket in the defeat in the\nsecond Test at Harare. Tendulkar on 69 had carved a widish delivery\nto point, to trigger another Indian batting collapse on the fourth day.\nGavaskar felt that the Australians were correct in rating their captain\nSteve Waugh as the best Test batsman in the world, for his ability to\nwin or save matches for his team on foreign soil.\nLaxman when the best batsman in the universe [Tendulkar] gets a\n288\n\nSachin\n\n\fhalf-century and then gets out, when a big score from him is the\ncrying need of the team. During the last league match against the West Indies\nat Harare on 4 July, when he scored his twenty-ninth ODI century,\nSachin had felt a sharp pain in his foot while setting offfor a single.\nDuring the match [on 4 July], I felt pain while batting. On 10August, by which time the ODI series was\nover, he announced he would be pulling out of the Test series as the\nfracture had not healed completely.\n'Sachin could have played the Test series only at the risk offurther\ninjury.\nTendulkar had missed some one-day matches just before and after\nthe 1999 World Cup due to back pain. But it was the first time since\nhis debut in Pakistan in November 1989 that he was missing a Test\nmatch. By 14 August 2001, when the first Test against Sri Lanka at\nGalle started without him, he had played a record 84 consecutive\nTests since his debut, stretching from Karachi in November 1989 to\nHarare in June 2001. There was just one Indian\nand one contemporary player among the twelve named and that was\nTendulkar, one of Sir Don's favourites. Mter Sir Don and before Garry Sobers [in the\nbatting line-up ]-what else can you ask for. The Test series started with\nIndia losing the first Test at Galle, bouncing back to win the second at\nKandy, and then being beaten in the decider at Colombo.\nThere was a significant innings in the last league match in the ODI\nseries against New Zealand, at Colombo, that India had to win to\nreach the final. The young Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag was asked\nto open the innings after Yuvraj Singh and Arnay Khurasiya had failed\nin that position. He grabbed the opportunity with glee, smashing the\nsecond fastest century by an Indian in oms (from 70 balls).\nRemarkably similar in height, build and looks, Sehwag also\ndisplayed an array of attacking shots normally the preserve of\nTendulkar, whose batting spot he had taken in his hero's enforced\nabsence. Tendulkar thrilled Schwag by sending a message of\ncongratulations.\nThe 'New Tendulkar', they were already calling him. Sehwag, though,\nwould have none of it.

Tendulkar's 54 was flashy and stylish\nand helped him finish second in the averages to the awesome Dravid\nwho was now beginning to emerge as the best batsman in the Indian\nteam as well as one of the best in the world.\nWest Indies minus an injured Brian Lara visited India for three\nTests and seven oms. Injury kept Tendulkar out of the latter but in the\nTest series Indian fans were shown the new side of the master batsman\nin the third and final Test at Kolkata.\nIndia having wrapped up the series by winning the first two Tests,\nboth teams were playing only for pride at the Eden Gardens. It took a\nmatch-saving double century stand between Tendulkar (176) and\nWS La.xman (154 not out) to salvage the match after India found\nthemselves struggling at 87 for 4 in the second innings, still trailing\nby 52 runs.\nTendulkar has rarely been a match-saver, more a match-winner\nwith his attacking batsmanship. Indeed it was way back in 1990 with\nhis maiden Test century at Old Trafford that he had salvaged a draw\nfor his country.\nThis time he batted for seven hours and though he never looked\ntroubled, it was the sign of a more mature, experienced cricketer.\nThe tour to New Zealand late in 2002 was an ill-advised one with\nthe Indian cricketers fatigued after a prolonged season.\n326\n\nSachin\n\n\fIt turned out to be a disaster, India being trounced in the two Test\nmatches as well as the seven oms, all played in freezing weather and\non sub-standard pitches.\nIt was the fourth such injury in the season, forcing him to miss\neven more one-day games, surely a sign that the wear-and-tear of13\nyears of non-stop cricket had begun to take a heavy toll on his body.", "Batsman_2005": "-Arjuna Ranatunga\nWith Pakistan touring India for the first time since 1999, for three\nTests and six ODis, the pressure was back on Tendulkar. Mter all, it was\nagainst Pakistan that he had made his Test debut in 1989 and which\nbetter side to achieve the world record for most Test centuries than\nIndia's traditional rivals.\nIndia began the series as hot favourites having beaten Pakistan on\ntheir own soil the season before and it was at Mohali in the opening\nTest match in March 2005 that Tendulkar fell short of the magical\nmark by just one scoring stroke.\nIt took a tremendous rearguard act by Pakistan's lower order\nbatsmen on the final day to save the Test after falling behind by 204\nruns in the first innings.\nIndia's massive first innings of 516 saw all the top six batsmen\nchipping in, with Virender Sehwag's 173 the standout innings.\nTendulkar played some glorious shots early in his knock before\nwithdrawing into his shell once he got into the 80s.\nA thick edge to gully saw him out for 94 in the last session of the\nthird day and the huge sigh of disappointm~nt around the ground\nmeant Mohali had missed out on their slice of cricket history. He did\nnot get a chance to bat the second time round.\n\n\fOnce again Tendulkar was eclipsed, this time by Rahul Dravid\nwho scored centuries in both innings. In a remarkable coincidence,\nTendulkar scored 52 in both the innings and India's total in each\ninnings was 407 (for nine wickets declared in the second).\nIf in the first innings he was out to a poor shot, in the second\nTendulkar fell to India's old bogeyman, umpire Steve Bucknor of\nJamaica who had created his own record by becoming the first umpire\nto stand in 100 Tests.\nTendulkar had once again missed out on that 35th ton. But on the\nfirst day he became the fifth batsman to cross 10,000 runs and in\nexactly the same number of innings (195) as his great friend and rival,\nBrian Lara.\nYounis Khan's outstanding batting (267 and 84 not out) was the\nfeature of this match as India's batting once again crumbled when\nchasing on the final day-a repeated failing both on the part of the\nteam and the individual (Tendulkar) over the last decade.\nSehwag responded with a double century of his own but India\nconceded over 100 runs on the first innings and the target of383 runs\nwas well beyond them.\nBy lunch on the fifth and final day; a draw seemed the most plausible\noutcome with India having lost just the wicket ofSehwag through a\nrun out. The last nine wickets crumbled for the addition\nof only 127 runs.\nIt was Tendulkar's inertia at the crease that was a major factor in\nthe collapse and the last Indian wicket fell with just a handful of overs\nleft in the match.\nMter striking a rapid 41 in the first innings, Tendulkar, the second\ntime around, scratched about for 98 balls and 140 minutes before he\nsuccumbed meekly to the part-time spin of Shahid Mridi for a\nmiserable 16 runs.\nTendulkar made a total of145 runs in six innings.\nHis previous 001 century had also been against Pakistan at\nRawalpindi 13 months earlier and in between there had been 15\ninnings, in which his highest score was 82 not out.\nIndia scored 315 for 6 and Pakistan scrambled home by three\nwickets from the final delivery of the match bowled by Tendulkar\nwith the scores level, which lnzamam calmly struck for a boundary.\nThe Pakistan captain took the Man of the Match award for his\nunbeaten 60 despite Tendulkar's ton (his 38th) and his bowling which\nfetched him the wicket of Abdul Razzaq. Inzamam's was, after all, a\nmatch-winning innings.\nTo make things worse for the Indians, Ganguly copped a ban of six\nSunny Eclipsed\n\n339\n\n\fmatches for the team's slow over-rates and Dravid led the side for the\nlast two games.\nWright was replaced by former Australian captain Greg Chappell\nand his appointment would set in motion one of the most dramatic\nand traumatic periods in the history oflndian cricket.\nChappell's first assignment was the Indian Oil om tri-series in Sri\nLanka in July where India lost in the final to the hosts, the West Indies\nbeing the third participant.\nGanguly was back as captain but his private spat with Chappell\nbecame public and all hell broke loose back home. And by now, Dravid had been formally appointed\nas captain.\nMter missing six months (and eight days, to be precise) of cricketincluding the ill-fated ICC 'Super Series' in Australia-Tendulkar was\ndeclared fit and found the spotlight trained unerringly on himself\nonce agam. 'Would\n340\n\nSachin\n\n\fhe be able to regain his batting touch after another injury layoff.\n'Tendulkar is still the very best in the business,' proclaimed former\nLanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga after watching him at Nagpur. But now it was back to the\nbusiness ofTest cricket against Lanka.\nWould the Ferozeshah Kotla, where in 1983 Gavaskar had drawn\nlevel with Don Bradman's then record of29 centuries, witness another\nmoment of cricket history.\nTendulkar did not disappoint.\nTendulkar had not been fluent to start with and had crawled to his\nhalf-century from 112 balls. But\nSunny Eclipsed\n\n341\n\n\fit had all been worthwhile in the end as the cricket world saluted the\nmaster who made the record his own after 16long years.'\nWinning the Test match and the next one at Ahmedabad only\nmade things sweeter and the Dravid-Chappell combine now appeared\nto have settled into the job comfortably.\nFor the third time in two years, India and Pakistan would clash on\na cricket pitch. Now at the start of2006, India\nwere once again crossing the border for three Test matches and five\nODIS. Pakistan\nrecovered and inched ahead by just seven runs on the first innings.\nIt meant the famed Indian batting line-up had to survive 164 overs\nto salvage a draw.\nTendulkar finished with 23 and 26 and the photo ofhim nearly\nsquatting on his haunches as a Mohammad Asif special speared out\nhis off stump in the second innings was splashed across most of the\nIndian dailies.' The\n342\n\nSachin\n\n\faccompanying article raised the question for the first time as to whether\nhe was nearing the end of his career.\nAlthough he had recorded the world Test record hundred six weeks\nearlier in Delhi, Tendulkar looked below his attacking best on the\ntour and the spate of injuries only added to the speculation. Tendulkar played a major role with 100 in the opening game at\nPeshawar which India lost on the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nIndia swept the next four matches and his innings of 95 in the\nthird at Lahore was Tendulkar at his best. There was a magical touch\nto his strokes and the Pakistani bowlers were at his mercy. So the\nresults for the team and his own batting in Pakistan had been decidedly\nmixed.\nThe first Test at N agpur was drawn and then India rolled over the\nvisitors at Mohali to win the second by nine wickets. It was a stunning move which left\nIndian cricket fans fuming and even Tendulkar had to face the wrath\nof his home fans for the first time.\nSet 313 runs in the fourth innings, the batting folded up in one of\nthe direst batting displays on home soil by an Indian side in living\nmemory.\nTendulkar was top scorer with 34 but when he departed at 76 for 5,\nthe boos from a small section of the crowd at the Wankhede Stadium\ncame as a shock to everyone present.\nTendulkar, though, once again had to sit it out with an injury, his\nthird in successive years.\nSachin had a brief stint with the Lashings club side in England in\ncharity matches after surgery to test his fitness.\nHe was back in India colours after a break of five months for the\ntri-series in Sri Lanka in August. Sachin faced just three deliveries in\nthe first match at Colombo before it was abandoned due to rain with\nIndia at 11 for no loss against the hosts.\nAll doubts were put to rest as he smashed five sixes (and 13 fours)\nin a masterly innings of 141 not out against the West Indies.\n344\n\nSachin\n\n\fWhat made it special was that he batted right through the 50 overs for\nonly the second time in 364 matches. We just\nhad to watch it and appreciate it, and it was a very special innings for\nIndia.'\nTendulkar also scored 65 in the return match but flopped in the\ntwo games against Australia (12 and 4), and India failed to reach the\nfinal. Tendulkar contributed just one half-century.\nBut there was a silver lining in the one-off T-20 International at\nJohannesburg which India won by six wickets with a ball to spare.\nIt remains the only Twenty20 International in which Tendulkar\n(he scored 10) has played and though no one could have dreamed of it\nat the time, India would take the cricket world by storm at the same\nvenue less than a year later.\nThe big story on the eve of the Test series was the return of Ganguly\nafter almost a year out of the Indian side. He was one of the batting\nstars in a low-scoring first Test at Johannesburg which India won by\n123 runs. Finally, India could boast of a Test match victory in every\ncricket playing country around the world.\nTendulkar's patchy form continued into the Test series with only\ntwo half-centuries from six innings. But it was his batting in the second\ninnings of the third Test at Cape Town that had the critics scratching\ntheir heads in dismay. Despite gaining a small first innings lead, the\nIndian batsmen retreated into their shells in the second with debutant\nslow left-armer Paul Harris tying down Dravid and Tendulkar. Tendulkar scratched around for 62 balls in\neking out 14 runs in what Wisden Cricketers' Almanac described as\n'desperately unconvincing' batting. It appeared the master batsman was\nweighed down by numerous factors including perhaps doubts over\nhis own fitness.\n\n346\n\nSachin.", "Batsman_2008": "Back on Top\n\nI just think Sachin played a super super knock today.\nHe was back for the Test series in Sri Lanka, but it was not a happy\ntime either for Tendulkar or the Indian team. The Lankans won the\nseries 2-1, the same margin as in India's previous tour in 2001, and\nTendulkar could only eke out a miserable 95 runs from six innings. Kumble on\nthe final day of the third Test in New Delhi.\nHaving pocketed the record for most Test centuries three years\nearlier, it was now time for Tendulkar to make another significant\nmark all his own-most Test runs.\nThroughout their careers Tendulkar and Brian Lara had been neckand-neck in batting feats and became great friends and competitors\nalong the way. The West Indian retired at the end of the 2007 World\nCup but not before he had amassed 11,953 Test runs.\nIt was only a matter time before Sachin surpassed that figure and it\nhappened the first ball after tea on the first day of the second Test at\nMohali.\nIndia were losing wickets at the other end and were in a spot of\nbother before Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly bailed them out.\nMore landmarks were cross~:d-his 50th Test half-century and\nthen the first batsman to go past 12,000 runs. It was\n366\n\nSachin\n\n\fdebutant pace bowler Peter Siddle who got his wicket for 88 shortly\nbefore stumps on the first day. It was India's biggest Test win and\nAustralia's heaviest defeat in terms of runs against India.\nTendulkar's 109 in the first innings was his 40th Test century and\n10'h against Australia and, with 396 runs in the series, he had once\nagain bounced back from a bad patch.\nTendulkar requested the selectors to rest him for the first three oms\nagainst England in late 2008. A surfeit of cricket and a spate of injuries\nwere no doubt behind the decision.\nWith a first innings lead of75 runs, Pietersen declared the England\nsecond innings with nine wickets down and set India 387 as the\nimprobable winning target. In 75 years of Test cricket on Indian soil\nno team had crossed 300 to win.\nIt took Sehwag's audacious batting to snatch the advantage out of\nEngland's hands. He did not spare any of the bowlers and raced to 83\nfrom 68 balls before falling lbw shortly before stumps on the fourth\nday. The Indian batting line-up had\ndeveloped a nasty habit of caving in to pressure in the fourth innings\nand 387 certainly looked a bridge too far.\nThis is where Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh took over.\nThere was a steely determination about Tendulkar's batting that\nwas awe-inspiring. The previous two-at Old Trafford\nin 1990 and at Chennai against Pakistan in 1999-ended in a draw\nand defeat for India, respectively.\nNot even an Indian fan could have put it better when Pietersen\ncommented: 'I just think Sachin played a super super knock today.\nDespite the injuries and the setback in the IPL, 2008 turned out to\nbe another splendid year for Tendulkar what with a major world record\nin his pocket.\nIn 2007 he had amassed 1425 runs in ODI runs, the seventh such\noccasion in his career. So notwithstanding the injuries and the doubters\n(former team-mate Sanjay Manjrekar being the foremost and most\nvocal), Tendulkar was once again among the top batsmen in the world.\nSachin's century in the semi-finals against Saurashtra was the 68th\nof his first-class career, including the 41 centuries in Test matches.\nRemarkably, that first innings duck was the first time he had been\ndismissed without scoring in a domestic first-class match on Indian\nsoil.\nThe year 2009 marks the 20th anniversary of Sachin's bow in\ninternational cricket.\nOver the last two decades Sachin has made most of the major\nbatting records his own.\n370\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe Pakistan tour cancellation also led to a hastily arranged ODI\nseries in Sri Lanka.", "School_Cricketer_1985": "He was a natural cricketer.-Ramakant Achrekar\nIf the Kanga League is the heart and soul of Mumbai cricket, the\nHarris and Giles Shield inter-school tournaments are its roots.

'Boys joined the school for cricket. If they wanted to study they\ncould have gone somewhere else,' says Ranji Trophy player Amol\nMuzumdar who studied with Sachin in Sharadashram.\nSachin started school in the Indian Education Society's New\nEnglish School, close to the family home in Bandra (East) where\nmost of his friends also studied. But the school lacked a good cricket\nground and coach. Till now Sachin had played cricket only during\nthe school vacations. Now he would have to combine studies and\ncricket. Cricket was more important\nthan fun and games in the backyard.\nBy now Sachin's life revolved around cricket and cricket alone.\nSachin made his debut in 1984 in the Giles under-15 tournament\nfor Sharadashram English (he was a reserve in the Harris under-17)\nagainst Khoja Khan High School at the Navroze Cricket Club ground\non Azad Maidan; he was 11 and a half years old.\nAjit was struck by the power in his kid brother's hands since most\ncricketers of that age do not have the strength to hit boundaries, getting\ntheir runs mainly in singles and two's.\nThe first person to predict success for Sachin was an umpire by the\nname of Gondhalekar. He was umpiring the quarter-finals against\nDon Bosco at Cross Maidan in which Sachin smashed ten fours in a\nknock of 50. The umpire predicted toAchrekar that the lad would one\nday play for the country-a prediction Achrekar brushed aside since\nthis was Sachin's first year in competitive cricket.\nAchrekar was keen that Sachin get a place in the Bombay Cricket\nAssociation (BCA) nets for under-19 boys which were spread across\nthe city and were usually conducted by an ex-Test cricketer.\nAjit took Sachin to the MIG (Middle Income Group) Cricket Club\nground, a short walk from their home in Bandra, to meet the coach in\ncharge, a man named Dandekar.\nSo the summer was spent in practice sessions with Achrekar, both\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\n17\n\n\fin the mornings and afternoons. The next day his brother and father\nsent him for coaching and his career in cricket started.\nAll through this year of1985, it was cricket, cricket and more cricket.\nHe ate cricket, drank cricket, slept cricket. Even after he broke into\ninternational cricket, Sachin was known to talk--cricket, of course land walk in his sleep. A batting session would be\nfollowed by tips from Achrekar, who was always on hand to guide his\nfavourite student. Bowling was a fascination with Sachin from the\nearly days and even then he bowled an assortment of medium pace\nand leg spin.\nIfhe got out early, Achrekar would take him across town on his scooter\nto the Azad Maidan where his Sassanian Cricket Club was playing,\nand Sachin would get to bat twice during the day.\nAt the age of12, Sachin played his first match in the Kanga League,\nscoring five for the Young Parsee Cricket Club in the 'F' division. The season began in right earnest in\nOctober and this time Sachin played for another of Achrekar's clubs:\nHind Sevak Cricket Club in the Gordhandas Shield, open only to\nclubs in the suburbs ofMumbai.

The 1985-86 season had turned out to be a\nnotable one for Sachin.

Sachin scored 42 and 150\nnot out in his side's victory and finished his Harris season with 596\nruns in five innings.

Sure enough, at the age of 14,\nSachin became the youngest player ever selected for Mumbai in the\nWest Zone Ranji Trophy league.\nAfter useful scores in the Kanga League-where he had now\nleapfrogged to the 'B' division-he was selected for the Sportstar\nTrophy for boys under 17.

After scoring 19 in the opening cneday match against League Cricket Conference at Sunderland,\nTendulkar was rested for the first county game versus Yorkshire at\nHeadingley. The victory came in the final over when\nTendulkar pulled West Indian fast bowler Ian Bishop for his second\nsix. Debutant leg-spinner\nAni. Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. Though\nTendulkar scored only 19, his straight six off spinner Eddie Hemmings\nwas a massive one, clearing almost 100 yards.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. India\nHail the Boy King\n\n57\n\n\fneeded 145 runs from the last 20 overs to win and got them in some\nstyle, thanks in part to a delightful little innings of 31 from 26 balls\n(two fours) by Tendulkar. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries. Tendulkar raced across from the wide long off\nHail the Boy Kin. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1991) called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines.' Only someone of Tendulkar's\nyouthful exuberance would have attempted such a catch, let alone\nsuccessfully executed it. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. When\nPrabhakar joined Tendulkar at 183 for 6, there were still two and a half\nhours remaining for England's bowlers to mop things up. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. Tendulkar was watchful, considering the perilous position\nthe team was in. Tendulkar off-drove Fraser for four, then\ncut him high and hard over the waiting slip cordon for another, to\nmove into his 90s.

For the first time, Tendulkar\nshowed glimpses ofhis prowess with the ball.\nIndia won the first 001 at Nagpur by 19 runs with Tendulkar\ncontributing 36. The second at Pune on 5 December saw him pick up\nhis first wickets in international cricket, those of openers Roshan\nMahanama and Dhammika Ranatunge, returning figures of9-0-392 with his gentle medium-pacers. To add to his wickets, Tendulkar\nrecorded his first ODI50 (53) which saw India win comfortably by six\nwickets.\nThe final game at Margao was played on an under-prepared pitch\nand halfway through the innings, Azhar and Tendulkar had to call for\nhelmets to play the Sri Lankan spinners as the ball turned and jumped\nalarmingly. Tendulkar's 30 was the top score in a miserable Indian\n68\n\nSachin\n\n\ftotal of 136 all out.\nTendulkar had a quiet tournament, though he equalled his highest\nscore of 53 in the final at Kolkata, in which India beat Sri Lanka by\nseven wickets.\nThe quarter-finals against East Zone at Guwahati from 11 to 15\nJanuary 1991 saw Sachin complete a unique treble. Uniquely,\nthere were two future India captains in this match, Ganguly and\nTendulkar, as well as two from the recent past-Ravi Shastri and Dilip\nVengsarkar. Lalchand Rajput (82),\nSanjay Manjrekar (122) and Vengsarkar (72) all cashed in while\nTendulkar top-scored with 159. Tendulkar's innings, his\nfifth century in 31 first-class matches, was divided in pace. South had in their ranks\nJavagal Srinath, Venkatapathy Raju, Arshad Ayub, Robin Singh and\nAni) Kumble. Not that it bothered Tendulkar. Their total of729 was beyond the reach of even\nthe formidable West batting line-up which could muster 'only' 561\nagainst a bowling attack that was virtually that of the Indian team\nitself\nTendulkar failed this time, and that may have made all the\ndifference. But Tendulkar's\ncontribution was just 25 and with his dismissal, West's hopes faded.\nIn one of those strange twists offate, the Delhi opener, one of the\nmost prolific batsmen in domestic cricket, died eight years later, in\n1998, after being struck on the head while fielding in a club match in\nDhaka.\nTendulkar had missed the West Zone league stage in the Ranji\nTrophy. Tendulkar\ntop-scored with 82 in Mumbai's total of390. Tendulkar's 125 was his third century in five first-class\nmatches. Though Delhi's second innings was a formality, there was\nenough time for Tendulkar to make his mark again, this time with the\nball. Tendulkar had\nfancied himself as a fast bowler till Dennis Lillee told him to\nconcentrate on his batting. There were centuries from Vengsarkar and Kambli as\nwell, while Tendulkar's contribution was 70 and 88 in Mumbai's\nsecond innings of 446 for 4 declared. Most of the top Mumbai players made useful runs, Tendulkar\ncontributing 47 before he was lbw to Chetan Sharma. It was\nnightwatchman Sanjay Patil who top-scored with 85.\nAt 3 down for 34, Tendulkar and Vengsarkar gor together in a\nrollicking stand worth 134 runs. Sachin took the bowling attack\nspearheaded by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma apart. The Haryana bowling was dispatched all around\nas Tendulkar raced towards a century which appeared inevitable till\nhe was caught by Jadeja off the bowling of off-spinner Yogendra\nBhandari for 96.\nJust two and a half years earlier, the schoolboy Sachin had faced the\nchampion bowler in the nets at the Wankhede Stadium.\nSachin's dismissal at 168 for 4, followed by that ofVinod Kambli\n(45), triggered another collapse even as Vengsarkar marched towards\na majestic century. When the ninth wicket fell, debutant pace bowler\nAbey Kuruvilla joined the captain with 50 runs still needed for victory.\nTendulkar would have to wait some more time to be part of a Ranji\nTrophy winning side. He was named as the Association of\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n73\n\n\fCricket Statisticians and Scorers oflndia (ACSSI) Cricketer of the Year\nand one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Indian CricketAnnual.\nThe cancellation ofPakistan's visit to India meant there would be no\ninternational cricket till October 1991 when India were scheduled to\nbe back in Sharjah for the three-nation Wills Trophy.\nThe opening match for India in the Sharjah three-nation Wills\nTrophy against Pakistan on 17 October 1991 saw the side record a rare\nwin over their arch-rivals. Manjrekar was the top scorer with 72. But\nit was Tendulkar's 52 not out from 40 balls, with five fours, that\nprovided the impetus towards the end of the innings.\nIn the final league match, which India lost to Pakistan under dark\nskies and in controversial circumstances, Tendulkar fell one short of\nanother 50. Tendulkar accounted\nfor opener Clayton Lambert, captain Richie Richardson, Gus Logie\nand JeffDujon.Mohan was effusive in his praise ofTendulkar's many talents\n(he also picked up the wicket of South Mrica's top scorer Wessels) in\nthe Sportstar (23 November 1991): 'It is impossible to fathom what the\nyoungster is capable of. Soon, very soon, people will be\nturning up only to watch Tendulkar play. Only Tendulkar\nwould use that dominance in that refreshingly orthodox way of his.'\nThe Man of the Match award was shared by Donald and Tendulkar,\nan unusual occurrence in international cricket, but one in keeping\nwith the spirit of the occasion.\n\n76\n\nSachin.", "Tendulkar_1992": " Boon was at the non-striker's end as Kapil bowled an inswinger to Allan Border of such perfect length that any left-hander\nwould have been bowled off-stump. There were also some\nbatting heroics from Manoj Prabhakar who stayed at the crease for\nover five hours. The Test marked the debut ofJavagal Srinath who\npicked up three wickets. Tendulkar had been a\ndisappointment so far, as was the Indian batting as a whole. But it\nwas Tendulkar's sublime century that had the critics once again eating\nout of the palm ofhis hand. Even as Shastri dropped anchor and\nsought to repair the early damage with a little help from Manjrekar\nand Vengsarkar, it was the silken skills of Tendulkar that had all of\nAustralia suddenly taking notice of the Indian team. The record stand\nfor the fifth wicket between Shastri and Tendulkar was worth 196 in\n198 minutes and as Shastri moved towards his first Test double century,\nTendulkar took centre stage with an array of dazzling shots that had\nthe spectators riveted. The fourth day's play belonged to Tendulkar as\nhe reached his century in 226 minutes from 171 balls, the youngest to\ndo so on Australian soil.\nAt 18 years and 256 days, Sachin had surpassed the previous record\nheld by Australian left-handed legend Neil Harvey who had made\n153 against India at Melbourne in 1948, at the age of19 years and 121\ndays, 25 years before Tendulkar was born.'\nIndia declined to declare on their overnight 445 for 7 (Tendulkar:\n120 not out) on the final day and added a further 38 runs to swell their\nlead to 170. Tendulkar was now improvising and got 28 of the last 38\nruns. With\nthe wicket taking plenty of spin on the final day, Azhar in desperation\nturned to Tendulkar to bowl some off spin.\nDavid Frith summed up the match eloquently in Wisden Cricket\nMonthly (February 1992): 'Tendulkar's creamy elegance, power and\nprecocity had even the local partisans cooing . It was bad luck for\nShastri that his double-century and his wickets will take second place\nin public memory behind Tendulkar's beautiful century.\nThe tri-series began in sensational style at Perth on 6 December\n1991 with Sachin Tendulkar getting the last West Indies wicket to\nearn a tie for India.\nCummins and last man Patrick Patterson had pieced together 13 runs\nwhen Tendulkar had Cummins brilliantly caught in the slips by a\ndiving Azhar, with the scores level.5 overs were the best om figures tor India till 1993-94. Tendulkar\ngave away just eight runs from his four overs and also scored a useful\n36 in India's score of208 for 7. Manjrekar and Tendulkar\nhit identical scores (57) and their stand of 102 stood out starkly in a\npaltry Indian total of 175 for 8 at Hobart.\nOn Top Down Under\n\n81\n\n\fSrikkanth-who was making a comeback after being\nunceremoniously dumped following the Palcistan tour-smashed 84\nat almost a run a ball with Manjrekar (55) and Tendulkar (48) helping\nto boost the score. Tendulkar's 77 was his highest score in 27\noms and he was now emerging as the most reliable of the Indian\nbatsmen. Though he did not\nclaim any wickets, Tendulkar gave away just 38 runs in his full quota\nof ten overs. But Man of the Match Tendulkar\nhelped break the shackles with 57 not out, which saw India home by\nfive wickets and into the finals.\nTendulkar once again top-scored with 69 from 100 balls, though he\nhad some lucky escapes.' Then Tom Moody's throw from square\nleg hit the stumps and the TV replay showed Tendulkar was short of\nhis ground. Ironically, just ten months later Tendulkar would\nbecome the first to be given out (run out) to this technology.\nWith 401 runs from ten innings (one not out) Sachin was the\nleading Indian batsman.\n82\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut for now it was back to the Test series with India down 2-0 after\nthree Tests. And\nTendulkar broke the back of the batting with two vital wickets at the\nstart of the innings. But it was the shocker which\nVengsarkar received in the second innings, stretching well forward to\nHughes, that took the cake and led commentator Ian Chappell to\nblurt out on air, 'If that was not outside the line of the off stump when\nit hit, then I'm a Dutchman. Azhar had dropped\nhimself down to number six to accommodate Tendulkar at four, since\nthe team had decided to go all out for victory in the hope of keeping\nthe series alive.\nJust as he had done in England and New Zealand in 1990, he went tor\nthe bowling and tore it apart. Prabhakar ( 64) put on 101 with him for\nthe seventh wicket in less than 90 minutes, and while they were at the\ncrease an improbable Indian victory suddenly loomed large. But it was Tendulkar and Kapil who had the media and the fans\nenthralled.\nThe fourth day also saw Tendulkar progress from his overnight 31\nnot out to his second century of the series, and already predictions\nwere being made by journalists and former cricketers about the\nglittering career that lay ahead of him. After Australia's 346, it took\nTendulkar's daring strokes to get his side to within 74 runs in the first\ninnings.\nTendulkar's century came from only 135 balls, with 14 fours, as he\ncut the formidable Australian pace attack to size in a breathtaking\ndisplay of aggression.\nBut they all paled iii comparison to Tendulkar's third century in 16\nTests.\n\n\fThe Tendulkar fan club was now growing rapidly. Tendulkar\nhas it. Nearly\na decade later, even after his twenty-fifth Test century, Tendulkar\nhimself rated this knock as among his top three (Cricket Talk, 9\nDecember 2000).'\n\n86\n\nSachin\n. Ajay Jadeja and\nVinod Kambli joined the team for the World Cup and Ravi Shastri\nwas back from Mumbai, having been declared fit after the knee injury\nthat had kept him out of the last two Test matches. At 63 for 2, it was left to the Mumbai pair of\nShastri and Tendulkar to put the innings back on the rails. Just as Tendulkar was looking like he would win the game\nsingle-handed, Botham tied him down and then foxed him with a\nslower one. The experienced Botham was delighted; the\nyoung Tendulkar anguished. India, in its innings, had reached 45 for 1 (Srikkanth\nthe batsman out, bowled for a duck by McDermott) after 16. Tendulkar's failure (he was out for 11)\nput further pressure on the lower order. The Indian total of216\nfor 7 was built around Ajay Jadeja's 46 (he opened in place of Shastri)\nand Tendulkar's 54 not out from 62 balls.\nInzamam-ul-Haq and Zahid Fazal both fell for two and at 17 for 2, the\nIndian bowlers had gained the upper hand. It\nwas Tendulkar who made the breakthrough, getting Sohail caught\nlow down at midwicket by Srikkanth for 62. Once Miandad had been\nbowled by Srinath for a painstaking 40, the rest of the batting fell apart\nand subsided to 173 all out, leaving India winners by 43 runs and\nTendulkar with his first Man of the Match award in the World Cup.\nIndia opened with Kapil Dev, but it was Tendulkar who stole the\nshow. He mastered all the bowlers\nexcept veteran off-spinner John Traicos, who was 26 years older than\nhim.\nTendulkar failed against the West Indies at Wellington, caught\nbehind off a perfect leg-cutter from Curtly Ambrose as India went\ndown by five wickets.\nTendulkar's personal total of283 runs came from seven innings at\nan average of 47.\nThe 22-year-old hit 42 in the final against England, following which\nhis captain predicted he would be the world's number one batsman in\nthe near future.\nTen years later, this is lmran Khan's analysis of the two batsmen\nfrom the subcontinent who promised to rule the world:\nI feel both Tendulkar and Inzamam are great players. When\nTendulkar first came to Pakistan in 1989, his timing was very\ngood. Tendulkar's innings management is much better than\nInzamam's. He has played a number of\nmatch-winning innings for Pakistan against quality fast\nbowlers, whereas I don't think Tendulkar has played that many\nmatch-winning knocks for India. There are lots of other\nbatsmen I would like to mention. Allan Border and Javed\nMiandad were not that talented, but the big plus of these\n92\n\nSachin\n\n\fbatsmen was that they were very good at building their\ninnings-a quality which certainly Tendulkar has. Sunil Gavaskar played just one season, and that was in 1980\nfor Somerset. The only Indian who made a career out of county cricket\nwas wicketkeeper-batsman Farokh Engineer who was part of the\nLancashire squad that enjoyed much one-day success in the 1970s.\nSachin Tendulkar had made a huge impression on the English public\nand the media on his first tour in 1990. Finally, Australian\nfast bowler Craig McDermott was signed up on a three-year contract\nstarting from 1992. Former Yorkshire\ncaptain Geoffrey Boycott, the focus ofa great deal of controversy at the\nclub during his playing days, then decided to sign up Tendulkar in\nplace of McDermott. But\nwith time running out, a lack of international fast bowlers to choose\nfrom, and sponsors Yorkshire Television keen on a big-name signing,\nthe final choice remained Tendulkar. Yorkshire ChiefExecutive\nChris Hassell flew to Mumbai in April 1992 for the signing, which\nTendulkar agreed to after receiving the stamp of approval from coach\nRamakant Achrekar and mentor Sunil Gavaskar. For his part, Tendulkar fitted\nin remarkably well, considering he was just 19 and aware that there\nwas a fair amount of opposition to the century-old 'no outsiders'\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n95\n\n\ftradition being dismantled in his favour. In addition, he struck 86 against Hampshire and a brilliant\n96\n\nSachin\n\n\f92 against Gloucestershire.\nTendulkar has always looked back on his county stint with affection.'\nTendulkar's season was curtailed when on 21 August he was\nsummoned by the BCCI to play in the Duleep Trophy. He was interviewed by Andrew Collomose for the Cricketer\nInternational (November 1992), at Scarborough, during his last game\nagainst Nottinghamshire. \"It is a time I will treasure,\" said\nTendulkar. The Test marked the second occasion on which Tendulkarwas\nout for a duck, caught and bowled by master off-spinner John Traicos.\nThe one-day festival match at Raadjasfontein that kicked off the\nSouth Mrican tour saw Tendulkar score a century against Nicky\nOppenheimer's XI.

It was 27 for 2 when Tend ulkar walked\nin. Tendulkar started hesitantly. It was Tendulkar's\nnineteenth Test and twenty-eighth innings. Time and again, Donald and McMillan bounced at him and\nTendulkar went up on his toes and used his powerful wrists to play\nattacking strokes to deliveries that were at least shoulder high.

Tendulkar was a major\ndisappointment, with only 144 runs from seven innings, and a highest\nscore of32.

Once again\nTendulkar top scored with 36 but the miserable total of125 all out was\novertaken in a canter.\nPerhaps goaded by events back home, the Indians now stormed\nback with Tendulkar leading the charge.\nA run-a-ball opening stand between openers Tendulkar (81) and\nVirender Sehwag helped haul the Indian campaign back on the tracks\nas Zimbabwe were beaten by 83 runs at Harare.\nNamibia, another African side, were crushed by 181 runs with\nTendulkar easing his way to 152, his highest World Cup score and 34'h\n001 century. Tendulkar hit a\nsparkling 50 with 75 runs flowing from the first 11 overs. It was Man of the Match\nTendulkar who knocked the stuffing out of the Pakistan bowling,\nespecially the much-vaunted Shoaib Akhtar whose pre-game boasts\nwere shoved down his throat.\nThe reply was just five balls old when Tendulkar top-edged Glenn\nMcGrath and it was all over despite a flourish from Sehwag.\nThough he received the Man of the Tournament award from Sir\nGarfield Sobers (his 673 runs a World Cup record), the post-mortems\npinpointed another Tendulkar failure at the crunch-time.\n\nllO\n\nSachin\n.", "Tendulkar_1993": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nEngland's tour to India under the captaincy of Graham Gooch saw\nMohammed Azharuddin placed on probation, in a manner of\nspeaking.\n\n\fKambli was quick to give credit to Tendulkar while receiving the\nMan of the Match award. Tendulkar's\n50 in the first innings promised much more before he had a lapse of\nconcentration and fished at a wide delivery from Devon Malcolm.\nJust as Eden Gardens in Kolkata was Azhar's favourite venue, the\nMA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai is where Tendulkar has scored\nthe maximum runs. In February 1993, Chepauk was witness to\nTendulkar's first century at home and his fifth overall. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. Three\nyears later, in March 2001, Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series 2-1.\nAlready there was talk of how Tendulkar in the years to come\nwould challenge Allan Border's record Test aggregate. I noticed too, for the first time, that Tendulkar\nwas taking over some of the field-placing chores from his captain who\nlooked on benignly. There was no talk at this stage of Tendulkar\nassuming the captaincy. The Test was a\ntriumph for the Mumbai trio of Kambli, Tendulkar and Amre,\nparticularly the left-hander. The third wicket stand with Tendulkar was worth 194\nruns in 44 overs, with the senior partner somewhat subdued.\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests: 236 not out by Sunil Gavaskar. The series finished\nlevel at 3-3, with neither Kambli nor Tendulkar being able to make\nmuch of an impact.\nBefore the series began, the selectors had named Tendulkar captain\nof the under-25 side which played against England at Cuttack prior to\nthe first Test. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India. Also in the team were W V Raman,\nSanjay Manrejkar and Salil Ankola, all with Test experience.'\nThe article proclaimed him the future captain of India.\nIt was heady stuf( He was the first Indian left-hander to score more\nthan one Test century and that too, in only his fourth Test.\nTendulkar's start to his Test career had been steady without being\nextraordinary, though of course his youth had given it a romantic\nsheen. India won the second Test at Colombo's sse by 235\nruns as Tendulkar and Kambli both recorded centuries, though not in\nthe same innings.\nTendulkar too had got a dicey decision in the first innings when he\nwas adjudged caught at short leg for 28, when it was doubtful whether\nhe had played the ball.\nKambli's third hundred saw India score 366 in their first innings.\nTendulkar was determined to make amends in the second innings as\nthe Indians went for quick runs and a declaration. Tendulkar's was the\nmost attractive by far. While Sidhu played the anchor role,\nTendulkar punched and drove the bowlers with ease and power. Tendulkar remained not out on 104. That helped\nTendulkar finish the series with an awesome average of101.' Sachin became the\nyoungest to lead a side in Test cricket-albeit in an acting capacity. Tendulkar enjoyed the experience\nas he told Vijay Lokapally of the Spottstar, in September that year: 'I\nwas a little bit satisfied. Tend ulkar would be part of that match\nat Dhaka, but not Azhar.\n\n108\n\nSachin.", "Tendulkar_1994": "-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe Hero Cup five-nation tournament in November 1993 saw India\nreach the semi-final against South Mrica despite being trounced by\nWest Indies in their league game and held to a tie by Zimbabwe.\nTendulkar had scores of26 not out, 2, 24 and 3. Vinod\nKambli was the first such victim in limited-overs cricket. Srinath had conceded\n23 runs in his last two overs and Prabhakar had gone for 16. It looked like a\ntoss-up between Srinath and Kapil. Then wicketkeeper Vijay Yadav\nsuggested the name ofTendulkar. Bowling tantalizingly slow medium-pacers, Tendulkar induced\npanic from the first ball.\nTendulkar managed to squeeze the ball between the bat and leg stump. The Indian players mobbed Tendulkar,\nhugging and kissing him as the crowd erupted with joy. Sachin spoke about that last over in an interview to Sportsworld\n(December 1993). Tendulkar chipped in with his\nhighest in the tournament, 28 not out, and then bowled Brian Lara for\n33 just as the West Indian batsman looked to be taking command.\nTendulkar had done enough-just about-to silence the critics who\nwere beginning to ask where his next big innings would come from.\nThe specific issue of his low position in the batting order was\ndiscussed in an interview (Sportsworld, December 1993) shortly after\nthe Hero Cup. Tendulkar was\nout for 15. Poor Sidhu\nwoke up with a stiff neck and had to sit down and Tendulkar\ncame up and asked me whether he could try his hand at opening. Sachinjumped in the air with joy and celebrated his\npromotion to the opening slot with a swashbuckling innings. Thus a\nstar opening batsman was born for India in ODis. It was Tendulkar's seventieth ODI and one that would\nchange the face of modern cricket. This is how New Zealand selector\nand journalist Don Neely recalls the match and Tendulkar's innings:\n\n120\n\nSachin\n\n\fNew Zealand made a dismal 142 and in the course of 49.\nJadeja's partner was Tendulkar.\nNo one who witnessed the batting ofTendulkar that day will\never forget it. No spectator wanted\nto run the risk of arriving at the ground late and missing\nTendulkar.\nAs he has done repeatedly since then Tendulkar has shown\nthat in both forms of the game he is an exceptional batsman.' In panic and not knowing where\nto pitch the ball, Morrison bowled a bouncer so high that it went way\nover Tendulkar's head.\nLarsen was considered the tightest of the Kiwi bowlers.\nTendulkar raced to 82 from 49 balls (22 scoring shots) before being\ncaught by skipper Ken Rutherford off Pringle.\nSeven years later, in April2001, after becoming the first player to\ncross 10,000 ODI runs, Sachin was asked by Vijay Lokapally of the\nSportstar about the thrust his career had got after opening the innings.\n'It was a big change,' Tendulkar said.\nJadeja (56) and Tendulkar (63) put on 103. The sixnation Austral-Asia Cup was an opportunity for Tendulkar to test his\nnew found skills as opener against the formidable bowling attacks of\nPakistan and Australia. In the course of his 63, Tendulkar broke\nanother record: he became the youngest player to make 2000 om\nruns.\nTendulkar gave India a blazing start. As he had done just a couple of weeks earlier, Jadeja was\ncontent to watch from the other end as Tendulkar went at the bowlers\nhammer and tongs.\nIn the semi-final against Australia, Tendulkar was dismissed\ncheaply by Glenn McGrath, though India won by seven wickets. Akram\nremovedJadeja for a duck and then Ata-ur-Rehman struck the vital\nblow when he had Tendulkar caught by Aamir So hail from a full toss\nfor 24. Tendulkar's position at the top of the batting\norder was, however, cemented by now.\nThe answer came on 10 September 1994 at the R. This was Tendulkar's seventy-eighth ODI. Tendulkar had a new opening partner in the tournament in\nall-rounder Manoj Prabhakar. Their stand was worth 87 and India's\ntotal of246 for 8 was built on Tendulkar's 110. Good deliveries as well as bad were treated with equal\ncontempt as Tendulkar launched an attack on Warne that saw him go\nfor 53 runs from his ten overs. the rain-reduced\nfinal against Sri Lanka, though Tendulkar was out for a duck.\nFrom October 1994 following the Singer Cup to December 1995,\nTendulkar played in all oflndia's 19 one-day games.-Sachin Tendulkar\nSachin Tendulkar hates comparisons. In 1996, when\nSir Donald Bradman created a sensation in the Indian media by going\non record that the Indian master's batting reminded him ofhis own,\nTendulkar was honoured. Among his\ncontemporaries, comparisons have most frequently been made\nbetween Tendulkar and the West Indian batting genius, Brian Lara. Mter the series, champion Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah\nMuralitharan was quoted as saying he found it more difficult to bowl\nto Lara than Tendulkar. 'Lara and Tendulkar are the hardest batsmen\nto bowl against, but the West Indian has troubled me more. Tendulkar\nis positive and difficult to bowl against, but I have an advantage over\nhim because he is a right-hander. Still, he has a long way to go to catch up\nwith Tendulkar's current record and has rapidly fallen behind after\nhis golden year of 1994. In 1997, Lara scored 394 runs\nat 39.40 while Tendulkar's figures were 1000 runs at 62.87 for Tendulkar); in 1999 Lara's 737 runs\nwere scored at an average of27.29 compared to Tendulkar's 1088 at\n68. In 2000 the comparative figures were: Tendulkar: 575 runs at\n63.23; and in 2001 Lara had 1151 runs at 63.94\nwhile Tendulkar's record was 1003 at 62. It made\nLara the first batsman after Bradman to simultaneously hold the record\nfor the highest Test and first-class score. Tendulkar, it may be recalled, had taken more than ten\nyears to score his first double century. The Trinidadian's appetite for\nmassive scores appeared insatiable while Tendulkar's seeming\nimpatience at the crease saw him fai.\nLara is four years older than Tendulkar. No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in 1994. Leading India was Tendulkar. Back home in India\naround the same time, Tendulkar too resigned from the captaincy that\nhad been thrust on him for the second time, late in 1999.\nAlmost every current and ex-cricketer ranks Tendulkar above Lara\nin contemporary cricket, though as we have seen, it was not always\nthat way. Allan Donald, for one, thought that Tendulkar was in a\ndifferent class to Lara as a professional cricketer. He also considered Tendulkar the\nbest batsman in the world, pulling away from Brian Lara every year.\nWriting in Sportsworld (May 1995), 'Tiger' Pataudi commented:\n'Tendulkar, I reckon is even more talented than Lara, but he is yet to\ndevelop the latter's temperament and so often pleases to tease.' And in\nGe1frey Boycott on Cricket: 'The way in which he [Tendulkar] reacted\n[to losing the captaincy in 1998] at a time of great stress illustrates the\ndifference between Tendulkar, who did not cause a moment's fuss or\ntrouble, and the petulant Lara. The product of a careful upbringing in\nIndia, Tendulkar, despite his superstar status, simply refused to waste\nhis time in altercations with the Indian board and selectors.' And finally,\nSir Donald Bradman in Roland Perry's Bradman's Best: 'Lara and\nTendulkar have proved to be the two best batsmen in the 1990s.\n130\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar has a very strong defence. Tendulkar\nis proving more consistent.'\nAs though to clinch the issue, Tendulkar was the only\ncontemporary cricketer to find a place in Sir Dan's controversial\n'Dream Team' released by Perry shortly after the legend's death in\nFebruary 2001.\nLara and Tendulkar came face to face in a Test series for the first\ntime when West Indies toured India late in 1994 under Walsh's\ncaptaincy. But Tendulkar certainly\nhad the better of the exchanges, averaging double that of Lara (67 to\n33), with a century and two half-centuries. Opener Sidhu\nbattered the Sri Lankan bowlers as he smashed eight sixes in his 124.\nBut it was Tendulkar's 142 that was a class apart.\n'Sidhu helped me a lot,' said Tendulkar after his seventh Test\ncentury.' Poised at 88 at the end of the first day,\nSachin reached his ton the next morning from just four balls from\nmedium-pacer Pramodya Wickramasinghe. It was\ntenacious batting in both innings by the Indians and an outstanding\nspell of fast bowling in the second by Srinath that swung the match\nIndia's way. Wicketkeeper NayanMongia (80) was\nthe utdikely top scorer and his sixth-wicket stand of 136 with\nManjrekar (51) took India to the respectable total of272. Left-arm\nspinner Raju then picked up five wickets to give India a kad of 29\nruns. But as\nthe day wore on, the pitch eased out and the Mumbai pair ofManjrekar\nand Tendulkar took the game away from the West Indies. Tendulkar's\n85 (he was the joint top scorer in the Test with Junior Murray) was a\nperfect blend of attack and defence, while Manjrekar came up with his\nIll\n\nSachin\n\n\fsecond 50 of the match. Tendulkar straight drove Walsh and worked\nhim off his pads for fours and then forced the removal ofleg-spinner\nDhanraj, hitting him for a six over long on and a four over mid-off. Tendulkar's 85 came from\n139 balls before he sliced an offbreak from Hooper to be caught behind. The target for the West Indies (363) was beyond their\nreach, and Srinath finished with 4 for 48 and the Man of the Match\naward. Nagpur saw Tendulkar score his first\ncentury against the West Indies as India built up a formidable 546 for\n9 declared and claimed a first innings lead of 118 runs. It helps batting with Sachin.'\nThis was Sidhu's sixth century, and in the last four he had been joined\non three figures by Tendulkar. The two were proving to be India's\nbatting mainstays. Tendulkar had come off two ducks in a row at\nFaridabad and Mumbai in the one-day series and had been feeling the\npressure.'\nSidhu and Tendulkar wrested control of the West Indies' attack\nafter off-spinner Carl Hooper had got rid of Prabhakar and Kambli\ncheaply. Tendulkar's back-foot shots went like bullets, as did his straight\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\nIll\n\n\fdrives. The double century partnership with his captain was the\nfirst over 200 in which Tendulkar was associated. The 179 was his\nhighest Test score till then and it took a brilliant, diving catch by Lara\nat mid wicket offWalsh to terminate it; he faced 319 balls and hit 24\nfours and a six. There\nwas another century stand between Sidhu (76) and Tendulkar (54) in\nthe second innings, for the third wicket. The Indian innings was marked by a maiden\ncentury by Manoj Prabhakar. Manjrekar and Tendulkar both chipped\nin with 40 while Srinath (52) was once again a revelation with the bat.\nLara (91) in the role of opener finally sparkled in the second innings\nwhen his team was looking for quick runs. India looked to Tendulkar, as usual.\nTendulkar started off the 001 series against the West Indies with\ntwo successive ducks. In the final against West\nIndies at Calcutta, Man of the Match Tendulkar was top scorer with\n66 and returned figures of1 for 35 from eight overs as India won by 72\nruns.\nLara and Tendulkar came head-to-head again in the Carribean in\n2002. Tendulkar scored his fourth\nODI century of the 1994-95 season in the league game against Sri\nLanka which India won by eight wickets. The margin of victory was\nrepeated in the final, though this time Tendulkar's score was 41.\nMeanwhile, back home Tendulkar had been appointed captain of\nMumbai for the 1994-95 Ranji Trophy season, and it turned out to be\na season of triumph for both the team and the captain, culminating in\na century in both innings in the final against Punjab. (The next season he would score the\nfastest century in domestic one-day cricket-from 69 balls for Wills\nXI in the Wills Trophy quarter-final against Hyderabad in Rajkot. At 21, Sachin.\nTendulkar had been away inN ew Zealand when Mumbai regained\nthe Ranji Trophy after a gap of ten years in 1994. Tendulkar scored 116 in the final against Haryana, which\nMumbai won by nine wickets. Apart from 856 runs in the\nRanji Trophy that year, he had struck his first ODI century as well as\ntons against New Zealand at Baroda, West Indies atJaipur and against\nSri Lanka in the Asia Cup in Sharjah. The Wills Trophy saw him\nscore 57 and 116 for Mumbai.'\nThere was to be another landmark in Tendulkar's life that year.", "Tendulkar_1996": " Their batting challenge\nwas now firmly in the hands ofSachin Tendulkar who had matured\nfrom 'promising' prior to the 1992 World Cup, to one of the best\nbatsmen in the world four years later. Here again, Tendulkar failed\nto fire, and ended with just one half-century. India, needing\n200 to win, coasted to victory with seven wickets to spare after\nTendulkar's opening stand of 163 with Ajay Jadeja. For the first time, the Indian team was being\nseen as a 'one-man army'-uncharitable though this was to\nTendulkar's talented teammates. Inevitably, the rnatch was seen as a\nTendulkar v Lara clash. Not only did India maintain their\nrecent supremacy over the twice-world champions by winning by\nfive wickets, but Tendulkar also outshone his famed rival. The scores:\nLara-2; Tendulkar-70. Chasing Windies'\n173, India lost two early wickets and it could so easily have been three:\nTendulkar was dropped at square leg when on 12, and then on 22 in\nthe tenth over. Tendulkar slammed 79 for the third wicket with Azhar in 16\novers and then added 31 with Vinod Kambli before being run out for\n70 after a mix-up with his chum. By then, India wen: comfortably\nplaced at 125 for 4 and the Man of the Match award was Sachin's\nagain. If India v West\nIndies was billed as Tendulkar v Lara, this one was the TendulkarWarnc show. This time Sachin won the individual honours against\nthe leg-spinner.\nThe contrast between Waugh and Tendulkar could not have been\ngreater. Faced with a\nbig target, Tendulkar decided to chance his arm and play some\naudacious shots. Warne's very first delivery was hit straight and\nhard for six and suddenly Tendulkar was on 90 from 88 balls. Bowling innocuous offbreaks,\nhe saw Tendulkar charge out and bowled wide down the leg side.\nWatching this innings by Tendulkar on TV at home in Adelaide,\nSir Donald Bradman was struck by a sense ofdeja vu. He told his wife\nthat he felt Tendulkar's batting technique was similar to his own. Tendulkar and Azhar were in devastating form,\nplundering 99 runs from the last ten overs. Tendulkar was run out in\nthe last over for a blazing 137, his highest 001 score which took his\naggregate in the World Cup to 424 runs for three times out. Only Kumble (2-39) and Tendulkar, who conceded\n41 from his ten overs, were spared the carnage in a show of might by\nthe Sri Lankans that was a sign of things to come.\nTendulkar's only failure in the entire tournament came against\nZimbabwe in the last league game, when he was bowled by Heath\nStreak for three. Openers Sidhu and Tendulkar\nmade a cautious start and 90 was on the board before the latter dragged\none from Ata-ur-Rehman on to his stumps for 31. It was a sedate innings by Tendulkar's standards,\ntaking 59 balls, as the openers weathered a hostile opening spell of\nfour overs from Wagar Younis. All the top order batsmen got a good\nstart with Sidhu holding the innings together with 93. His 45 from 26 balls helped India to a huge 287\nfor8. But Sri Lanka recovered to\npost a healthy total, with Tendulkar looking the most impressive of\nthe bowlers with 2 for 34 from his ten overs.\nOnce again, the onus was on Tendulkar and he found an able partner\nin Manjrekar. Left-arm spinner Jayasuriya replaced\nMuralitharan and slid one down the leg side. The ball brushed\nTendulkar's pad and he moved out of his crease, looking for a leg bye.\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n143\n\n\fThe Indian batting after that defied all reason.\nTendulkar finished with the most runs in the tournament: 523\nruns at 87. Tendulkar's round 100 was his first century\nagainst Pakistan in either form of the game.\nNot surprisingly, it was Tendulkar who led the charge with his\nsecond century in the last three matches against Pakistan.\nAs a result, Tendulkar received a warning from match referee Ranjan\nMadugalle for the abuse and pointed finger directed at the departing\nbatsman. Madugalle also issued him a friendly warning when the\nissue of the logo on his bat cropped up again and Tendulkar quietly\nremoved it to avoid another fine.\nThe match saw India record its highest total to date (305 for 5)\nwhile the stand for the second wicket (231) between Tendulkar and\nSidhu was India's best for all wickets. Under these\ncircumstances, Tendulkar, the trusted lieutenant; was already being\nperceived as the de facto captain with Azhar often letting him set the\nfield and handle the bowling change. Azhar's batting form was in\ntatters too, and the story goes that Tend ulkar virtually led him by the\nhand to the dressing room door in Sharjah when India recorded their\nrare triumph over their arch-rivals.\nTendulkar had made his first Test century at Old Trafford on the 1990\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n145\n\n\ftour of England. Though Nasser Hussain took the Man of the Match\naward for his maiden Test century, it was Tendulkar who stood out\nwith his 122 out of an Indian second-innings total of219. 'The real\nMan of the Match,' as Wisden Cricket Monthly aptly put it. With wickets falling in a heap\naround him, Tendulkar went for the bowling on a track that offered\nplenty ofhelp to the seamers.\nTendulkar was ninth out when he skied a bouncer from outside off\nstump from Chris Lewis to Graham Thorpe, who caught it running\nbackwards at midwicket.'\nThe Sportstar spoke to Tendulkar (29 June 1996) and asked him to\nrank his nine Test tons. At number three was the 111 against\n146\n\nSachin\n\n\fSouth Mrica at Johannesburg in the same year.\nHis century at Sydney in 1992 was placed number five, followed by\n179 v West Indies (Mumbai, 1994); 165 v England (Chennai, 1993);\n142 v Sri Lanka (Lucknow, 1994) and finally, 104 not out, also against\nSri Lanka (Colomho sse, 1993). Tendulkar\nwas bowled by a beauty from Lewis for 31. Ganguly followed up\nhis debut ton with 136 while Tendulkar came the closest he has ever\nbeen in his career to making two centuries in the same Test. Dropped at slip on zero and then surviving a confident\nlbw appeal off Dominic Cork, Tendulkar appeared to have been\ncoasting to his maiden double century. This is how he defended himself in an article\nin the Times if India nearly a year later (June 1997):\nBy the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour of 1996,\nmy name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season.\nThere was no doubt, however, that Tendulkar was streets ahead of\nall the other batsmen in the series, so it didn't come as a surprise when\nhe was chosen as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wtsden\nCricketers' Alrnanack (1997).\n\n148\n\nSachin.-Sachin Tendulkar\nIt was a virtual fait accompli following the England tour that Sachin\nTendulkar would be asked to take over the captaincy from Mohammad\nAzharuddin. The youngest in the history of Test\ncricket to take on the responsibility was 'Tiger' Pataudi. Appointed vice captain for the series, Pataudi was groomed for\nthe top post, as was Tendulkar. But while Tendulkar had three years as\nthe number two, Pataudi did not enjoy the luxury of even one full\nseries. Mohan summed up the mood oflndian cricket followers:\n'The way forward for Indian cricket is to appoint Sachin Tendulkar\ncaptain now.'\nSure enough, on 8 August 1996, when the squad for the Singer Cup\none-day tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Sahara Cup 'Friendship' oneday series against Pakistan in Toronto was announced, Sachin was\nnamed captain. The question on everybody's mind was, could\nTendulkar, the batsman with the golden touch, transfer those skills\neffortlessly to the captaincy as well.\nThese doubts were dispelled-at least for the time being-upon\nTendulkar's debut as captain against Sri Lanka at the R. Though India were routed by\nnine wickets, Tendulkar marked the day with his ninth 001 ton and\nadded 129 runs for the third wicket with Azhar. It was the world\nchampions' first home game, five months after winning the title, and\nonce again it was the explosive opening pair of Jayasuriya and\nKaluwitharana that knocked the stuffing out of the Indian bowling.\nIn his book Indian Cricket: The Captains-From Nayudu to Tendulkar,\nPartab Ramchand wrote about Tendulkar's first stint in charge:\nReally there can be nothing but praise for the manner in which\nTendulkar conducted himself in his various capacities as\ncaptain.\nThough his captaincy was praised as positive, Tendulkar's batting fell\naway after he won the Man of the Match award for an unbeaten 89 in\nthe first match, which India won by eight wickets. Tendulkar reacted angrily.' (Sportsworld,\nOctober 1996)\nThere would be a one-offTest for the inaugural Border-Gavaskar\nTrophy in New Delhi in October, followed by a three-Test home\nseries against South Mrica. Tendulkar\nfailed with the bat (10 and 0) in his first Test as captain. Tendulkar was in sparkling form and had three half-centuries in\nthe league phase.'\nThis it did, folding up for 185 in reply to India's 220 for 7, with the\nonly 50 of the low-scoring game inevitably coming from Tendulkar.\nTendulkar's proactive approach while defending the small total must\nhave come as a pleasant surprise to most of the team, as they were used\nto Azhar's low-key approach to captaincy. Tendulkar\nwas more than just active, he was a touch hyperactive, whether in\nadvising bowlers, handling the field placements with elaborate care,\nor even taking advice at on-field meetings. It was a Sachin who eschewed stroke play for\noccupation of the crease, in an echo ofhis mentor Gavaskar's prediction\nin his column. Sachin\nTendulkar's captaincy, dynamic in most parts, and Mohammad\nAzharuddin's batting touch, a splendid recreation of all that is good\nabout Indian batsmanship, came about because the switch at the top\nwas made well in time.\nTendulkar led the a:,sault with his tenth 001 century and South Mrica\nwere routed.\n\n154\n\nSachin\n.-Shane Warne\nThe third ODI against Sri Lanka at Margao on 28 December 1997 was\nSachin Tendulkar's last in charge before he was sacked on 2January. The defeat meant Tendulkar\nhad lost 31 of the 54 oms in which he had led since taking over in\nAugust 1996. Harsha Bhogle had\nthis to say in the Spottstar (25 October 1997), nearly three months\nbefore Tendulkar's sacking: 'It is not the number of runs that he has\nscored, or hasn't, that causes as much concern as the personality he\nseems to project now. Tendulkar could always punish good ball and\nbad alike and offer more than one shot to a ball.' Tendulkarwas interviewed by the Telegraph\n(1998) and asked ifitwas easier not being captain. He said: 'We removed Tendulkar because he could\nnot take the pressure ofboth batting and captaincy.'

Applauding\nis Australian fast bowler Peter Siddle. The selectors\nreplace him with Sachin Tendulkar-and the nation goes into\ncollective frenzy, expecting the master batsman to produce\nmiracles. And in retrospect, it is here that\nTendulkar's troubles with the selectors begin.\nTendulkar protests.\nMeanwhile, master batsman Mohammad Azharuddin slides.\nReinstated for the Asia Cup and the Test series in Sri Lanka,\nAzharuddin comes good with the bat.\nAt this point, a section of the selectors openly come out in\nfavour of the sacking of Tendulkar and reinstatement of\n184\n\nSachin\n\n\fAzharuddin as India's captain. At this point, Sachin Tendulkar is doing\nvery well with the bat. And yet, sections of the media carry on\nthe inspired campaign-that Tendulkar is feeling the pressure\nof captaincy, that his batting is falling apart, that India's losses\nare attributable to this factor and this factor alone.\nThe five game Sahara Cup in Toronto sees Azhar still in fine\ntouch-while Tendulkar hits a bad patch.\nHowever, the selectors, who have been making a case for the\nsacking of Tendulkar, fail to muster a majority within the\ncommittee. And board president Raj Singh\nDungarpur steps in to read the riot act, and indicate firmly that\nTendulkar should not be tampered with. Sunil Gavaskar, also on live\ntelevision, is scathing.\nContrast this with Sachin Tendulkar, who was recently\nappointed 'captain for 27 days. When, both before and after the\nAsia Cup, two selectors have systematically, under the guise of\nanonymity (the heck with the no names policy-the two\nselectors in question are Sambaran Bannerjee and Shivlal\nYadav) spoken to the media about their determination to sack\nTendulkar. When national\nnews magazine The Week carries a cover story, quoting a\nnational selector and an unnamed Beer official as saying that\n186\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere was a move, with sanction from a section of the board, to\nsack Tendulkar. And when the same magazine, and others,\nopenly allege that a cartel of bookmakers, unable to make any\nheadway with Tendulkar, have begun exerting monetary\ninfluence on the selectors to axe him. We present\nsamples:\n'The reason why the selectors fell back on Azharuddin was\nthat he was the only player, other than Tendulkar, to be a\ncertainty in both forms of the game . But last we heard,\nSachin Tendulkar was perfectly happy with wife Anjali and\nnewborn daughter Sara. Asked why Tendulkar was sacked,\nRungta on behalf of Desai said that the only criterion was bad\nbatting, and not any perceived defects in the captaincy.\nIf that is the case, then why is Tendulkar not captain of the\nTest side, considering that he is aggregating over 1,000 runs,\nand averaging over 63, in Tests this year-the highest of any of\nthe Indian batsmen. We wanted to make a last ditch effort to\navoid the unpleasant step of axing Tendulkar, so we asked him\nto bat lower down in one dayers. The selectors ask Tendulkar to bat\nlower down. Versus Pakistan, 3 off\n188\n\nSachin\n\n\f4.\nIn fact, against Sri Lanka, Azhar is ranked below Tendulkar,\nwho tops with 88, Ganguly (73),Jadeja (60) and Sidhu (53),\nwith 52 runs to his name. Samples:\n~I of us have tremendous respect for Tendulkar, and not since\nGavaskar has anyone received so much admiration from all as\nTendulkar has got. How then do they account for the fact that\nTendulkar's average in Tests this year is higher than his lifetime\naverage.\nMore from Desai: 'The selectors have gone on record\nappreciating Tendulkar's sportsmanship of taking all the blame\non himsel\u00a3 He is the type to carry on the battle. The\nmedia held a gun to Tendulkar's head and asked him to bat at\nnumber four (interestingly, Desai before the Sri Lanka series\nvehemently denied that the selectors had asked Tendulkar to\nbat lower down, and said that was a media-propagated lie; today,\nRungta confirms that the selectors had indeed done so in a 'last\nditch attempt' to avoid sacking him-so who is lying, here.\nThe media consistently refused to give Tendulkar the team he\nasked for.\n'No, we have not officially been informed of Tendulkar's\nresignation . They said in so many words that after the third ODI\nagainst Sri Lanka, Tenduikar has told the selectors that he would\nlike to step down. However, it must be made clear that any\ndecision on the matter will be our own decision, and not\nTendulkar's. Two months after Tendulkar's\nsacking, he resigned on health grounds. Tendulkar was back to his best in one-day games while\nAzharuddin's added responsibilities appeared to bring out the best in\nhim again.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by 18\nruns in the preliminary game. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. Their top scorer with\n77, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket. Once again,Tendulkar was in\nthe thick of things. He had bowling figures of7-0-45-3 and then he\nput the Pakistani bowlers to the sword with 95 runs from 78 balls,\nwith five sixes and six fours. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n192\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance. The target seemed out oflndia's reach, though they\nwere given a flying start with Tendulkar smashing 41 from 26 balls. Amazing because it had been tried by\nTendulkar a month earlier at Sharjah against Pakistan.) Ganguly\nwas Man of the Match for his superb 124 while Tendulkar took the\nMan of the Series award. He\nwas now considered the greatest bowler in the world, just as the tag of\ngreatest batsman rested on Sachin's shoulders.\nBefore the series, Tendulkar's preparations consisted ofgettingsome\nlocal leg-spinners to bowl to him on a pitch where the area outside the\nleg stump had deliberately been roughened. In a decade of\nfirst-class cricket, Tendulkar had not come close to a double century. Tcndulkar was 204 not out, his best in first-class cricket. From the\nIndian team's point ofview and from 1endulkar's too, this pertormance\nwas vital.\nTendulkar reached his first 50 from 46 balls and his century came\nfrom 90 with 15 fours and a six. By the time he declared, Tendulkar\nwas on 204, scored in 269 minutes from 192 balls, with 25 fours and\ntwo sixes. Once again, Tendulkar employed the rough-outsidethe-leg-stump tactics at the Chennai nets. This time, though, he had\nbowlers of the calibre ofKumble and L. All the Warne v Tendulkar hype\nhad obviously got to Sachin. The first ball was smashed past the bowler. Tendulkar had been too hasty in trying\nto assert his authority over Warne and had paid the price_.\nTendulkar walked to the wicket half an hour into the fourth Jay,\nwith the score on 115 tor 2, after Sidhu had softened up the bowlers\nwith a hard-hitting 64. 'Taking into\naccount the pitch conditions and the fact that he was facing arguably\nthe best wrist spinner of them all, Tendulkar's 199-ball innings was\none of the greatest batting exhibitions of modern times,' wrote OJ\nRutnagur in Wisden Cricket Monthly (May 1998).\nWarne was reduced to desperation by Tendulkar's uncanny\njudgement of the direction and degree of spin from the bowler's hand. All those hours spent\nplaying against the leggies in the 'nets', pitching in the rough, now\npaid off for Tendulkar. But Tendulkar was determined not to allow the\nbowler to gain the upper hand in their absotbing personal duel.\nBatsmen around the world for many years had floundered against the\nleg-spinner pitched on the rough on a turning wicket.\nSo was Sachin's Man of the Match award. Once again, Tendulkar was in a murderous\nmood and once again Warne was his main target. The series\nwas decided, and Azharuddin held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy that\nIndia had first won in 1996. It was a case of too little\ntoo late, and once again Tendulkar proved he was peerless, with a\nsparkling 177.\nIn his autobiography published three years later, Warne admitted\nthat Tendulkar had had the best of their exchanges during the series.\nTendulkar carried his form against the Aussies into the Pepsi tri-nation\none-day series, where Zimbabwe joined the two teams.\nThis time Tendulkar won his customary Man of the Match award for\nhis success, not with the bat but with the ball-a first for him. Azhar introduced Tendulkar into the attack more out of\ncompulsion than anything else. Bevan and Tom Moody\nstruck a flurry ofboundaries before Bevan stepped out to Tendulkar in\na bid to increase the run rate. Tendulkar got his first fivewicket haul when Martyn was caught at deep mid-off. Tendulkar's analysis was 10-2-32-5, beating his\nprevious best of 4-34 against the West Indies at Sharjah in 1991.\nNot so surprising was another Tendulkar ton in the Kanpur game\nagainst the hapless Australians, who must have been sick and tired of\nthe sight ofhis broad bat by now. Tendulkar decided\nthe best way would be to get to the pitch of the ball and go for the\nbowling if India had to qualify for the final.", "Tendulkar_1997": "-Dave Richardson\nThat old tag, 'Tigers at home, kittens abroad,' which has attached itself\nto the Indian team over the 1990s must have been at the back of\nSachin Tendulkar's mind as he prepared himself for his first tour as\ncaptain.'\nAs has often happened in Tendulkar's career, the rival bowlers and\nfielders reserved their best for when he was at the crease. Following\ntwo half-volleys which were driven regally to the boundary, Tendulkar\ngot one that pitched on a perfect length just cutside off stump.\nThe batsmen were Tcndulkar and Azhar, the stand was worth 222,\nthe runs came in 40 uvers and produced 175 minutes of some of the\nmost exhilarating batting seen in the history ofTest cricket. Tendulkar's was more along classic lines, though no less\nattractive. With the stand worth 197 Azhar\nwas dropped by Cronje at extra cover; a run later, it was Tendulkar on\n156\n\nSac hi n\n\n\f80 who was reprieved by Hudson at gully. Tendulkar looked determined to\nreach his first double century. Instead, he was out to a catch of such\ndazzling quality by Adam Bacher deep on the square leg fenceleaping backwards and plucking the ball with one hand as it sped to\nthe boundary-that Tendulkar could only stand shaking his head,\nhand on hip.\nThe man with the best view was South African wicketkceper Dave\nRichardson and this is what he told me about Tendulkar's innings: 'I\ncan say it was the only occasion when I have honestly enjoyed an\nopposing player scoring a century. Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February 1997):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of 1997 the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n157\n\n\fsublime .Tendulk:ar's innings was what one expects from him:\nmature, controlled, commanding-the weight of his country's\nexpectations resting lightly on his shoulders.2\nwas largely due to Tendulkar's rip-roaring 104, ably supported by\nAjay Jac;leja (56 not out). Dravid had opened with Ganguly in the\nprevious matches, but now Tendulkar was back at the top of the order\nto give the run chase the launching pad it needed. Tendulkar\nset the tone with a lightning 45 from 33 balls and his stand of 66 with\nDravid came at eight an over.Mohan revealed Tendulkar's fatalistic state of mind midway\nthrough the tour in the Sportstar (1 March 1997): 'Sachin was speaking\nto a friend in his room that evening, asking him ifhe should consider\nstepping doyvn from the captaincy. But the experienced journalist got it\nwrong when he repeatedly stated in the article that Tendulkar's\ncaptaincy would be safe for many years to come.\nIn the interview that accompanied Mohan's article in the same issue,\nTendulkar expressed concern at the enormous workload imposed on\nthe Indian players. There was also an uncanny quote from Tendulkar. Apart frorn\nVenkatesh Prasad, debutant Abey Kuruvilla, the raw D. Srinath's replacement was\nHyderabacl's Noel David, an off-spinning all-rounder, even though\nmedium-pacer Salil An kola was on standby, and was the first choice of\nthe team management.\nIronically, Tendulkar had been keen on an off-spinner at the\nselection meeting forth<. Tendulkar pointed out that this was\nthe first time an Indian touring side had escaped defeat in the opening\nTest of a series abroad since he made his debut in Pakistan in 1989.\nIf this series was to be a match up between Lara and Tendulkar, the\nWest Indian had certainly won the first round. Tendulkar had scores of7 and 15 not out.\nPlaying in his fiftieth Test match, Tendulkar ground out one of his\nslowest batting displays after the West Indians had been dismissed for\n296 in their first innings.\nTendulkar had occupied the crease for 306 minutes when Walsh\nran him out for 88. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for 298. Tendulkar played a cla~sy innings,\nand was eight short ofhis first century in the West Indies, when umpire\nLloyd Barker failed to call Ian Bishop for over-stepping.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of 170 runs. Their runs made all the difference in the end and Tendulkar was\ncriticized for his defensive field placements during the stand. Tendulkar\nwas done in by the bowler, rather than the pitch. Wtsden Cricket Monthly (May 1997) compared the\nperformances of the two 'superstar captains'. Tendulkar finished second in the\naverages behind Dravid with 289 runs at 57.\n\n164\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe matter of team selection was also raised and here Tendulkar's\nwords were to haunt him soon, considering the storm just ahead.\nTendulkar admitted he had misread the pitch on winning the toss\nin the first match.\nGanguly was back for the second match.\nDefeat and Despair\n\n165\n\n\fthe target was revised to 113 from 40 overs and the runs were promptly\nrattled off by openers Tendulkar (65 not out) and Ganguly from just\n23. 'Incredible,' was all a stunned\nTendulkar could utter at the end of a shocking collapse in the third\ngame at Amos Vale, St. Even as he prepared to go out to the\ntoss, those on the scene reported that Tendulkar was forced to separate\na furious Madan Lal and Sidhu, with the coach accusing the batsman\nof'not wanting to play for the country'.", "Tendulkar_1998": " Now\nTendulkar was determined to prove a point to the spectators who had\ninsulted him and his team in December 1997. Once again, it was\nTendulkar who played the lone hand, though a losing one. The Kiwis excelled in the field and three oflndia's\ntop batsmen-Tendulkar, Azhar and Jadeja-were run out. Thanks to\nTendulkar, the real winner of the dramatic night. Laxman hung around to give Tendulkar some support. But it\nwas clear to Tendulkar himself that only he could turn the tide. Tendulkar was stunned by the decision\nthat sent him on his way and lingered for a moment in disappointment.\nLooking back on that night, having watched the match on video,\nTendulkar expressed surprise at the manner in which he strode into\nthe pavilion.\nUnbelievable as it may seem, 48 hours later, Tendulkar matched\nthat magical innings of his, stroke for stroke. It was Sachin's twenty-fifth birthday\nThe stage was just right-India v Australia in front of25,000 Indian\nfans. Tendulkar's share this time\nround was 134 from 131 balls, with 12 fours and three sixes. Steve Waugh\n202\n\nSachin\n\n\fconfessed that Tendulkar had to be the best after Bradman: 'We were\nbeaten hy one man. Harsha Bhogle writing in\nthe Spottstar (9 May 1998) sounded a note of caution: 'The issue with\nSachin Tendulkar is not whether he can keep his sense of balance\namidst the uncontrolled hysteria that surrounds his existence. Tendulkar's greatness lay in his feats in both forms of the\ngame.\nDesert Storm\n\n203\n\n\fWhat was phenomenal was the amount of cricket Sachin had\nplayed in the last nine years.36),\nTendulkar had played 62 Test matches (average 54. Tendulkar was rested for the\nfirst two matches, apparently much against his own wishes. Tendulkar's return for the\nsecond game against Bangladesh ensured a full house at the Wankhede\nStadium. He contributed 33 as India won by five wickets, as they had\ndone in the first match.\nAlready assured of a place in the final, the Indians were beaten by 69\nruns, with Tendulkar falling for 18. Fired by this defeat and his two\nfailures with the bat, Tendulkar led a resurgent India in the final against\nKenya at Eden Gardens. Openers Ganguly (80) and\nTendulkar (65) put on a sparkling 115 in 18 overs, easily overhauling\nSri Lanka's 243 for 6, with eight wickets and plenty of deliveries to\nspare.2\novers, Tendulkar (53) galloping to his 50 in 33 balls, in reply to New\nZealand's 219 for 8. The\nIndian innings was marked by a world record opening stand of252\nruns from 43 overs by Ganguly and Tendulkar. Both got centuries,\nwith Tendulkar in his one hundred and ninty-sixth ODI now level\nwith Haynes after his 128 from 131 balls. It was Tendulkar's third\ncentury and third Man of the Match award in three consecutive triseries finals in the span of three months, India having won all three.\nThe pair were out to successive deliveries, though there was an element\nof doubt in third umpire Peter Manuel's decision against Tendulkar.\nManuel took his time over the stumping appeal offJayasuriya, even\nas it appeared that the batsman's right toe was within the crease.\n\n206\n\nSachin.\nTendulkar found himself leading the Rest of the World XI. Kumble,\nJavagal Srinath and Sourav Ganguly. The MCC attack was formidable,\nwith Allan Donald, Srinath, Glenn McGrath and Kumble. Sanath\nJayasuriya opened with Tendulkar, but was soon lbw to Srinath and\nDonald picked up Saeed Anwar cheaply to leave the Rest of the World\nat 54 for 2.\nTendulkar was initially scratchy and was troubled by Srinath.', something he\nhad never said to a batsman at any time in his career. 'Perhaps a hundred years from now\nMCC will stage a Tendulkar Memorial match.'\nFor an Indian cricketer to play for his country for nearly a decade and\nnot be involved in a major controversy, is one more 'record' Tendulkar\ncould have claimed. That one player, naturally, was Sachin\nTendulkar.\nIn fact, Tendulkar and the others quite enjoyed the atmosphere. There\nwas an even bigger shock in the next game against Canada, with the\nbest batsman in the world out for two, the victim of an unknown 35On Top of the World\n\n215\n\n\fyear-old from Granada by the name ofDavisJoseph. This time\nTendulkar scored 45 before he fell to Damien Fleming. Indian cricket had striven in\n1998 to overcome the traumas of the year before. Tendulkar expressed his sentiments in an interview\nto Vijay Lokapally in the Sp01tstar (10 October 1998): 'I have always\ntaken great pride in representing the country and nothing gives me\ngreater joy than seeing the tri-colour flutter high in the stands. Medium-pacer Neil Johnson\non his debut got Tendulkar in both innings, for 34 and 7. And at Bulawayo in the opening\ngame, Tendulkar scored his eighteenth ODI century to overtake West\nIndian opener Desmond Haynes' world record. Tendulkar's eighteenth came four years\nafter his first in Colombo in 1994. Ten of Tendulkar's\ntons had come abroad and the rest at home. It meant that Indian\nbatsmen now held the record for most centuries in Tests (34 by Sunil\nGavaskar) and oms. Tendulkar left his mark on the tournament in the third quarterfinal where India faced Australia, this time minus Warne and McGrath. Then Tendulkar\nand Dravid began the rebuilding and Jadeja weighed in with 71 to\ntake India past the 300-run mark. Tendulkar was awesome. By the\ntime he was smartly run out for 141 from 127 balls, he had smashed\n13 fours and three sixes and the Indian total of307 for 8 was a formidable\none. They were 145 for 2 when Tendulkar\nwas tossed the ball and started conjuring up wickets with his assortment\nof 'offies' and 'leggies'. Tendulkar came\npretty close, and the Australians were all out for 263.\"t match, the\nsemi-final against the West Indies, in which they were beaten by six\nwickets with Tendulkar out at eight. Tendulkar notched up his twentieth century\nagainst Zimbabwe for a grand total of 36 centuries in international\ncricket, taking him past Sunil Gavaskar, Viv Richards and Desmond\nHaynes, all of whom had a combined Test and ODI total of35 centuries. Chasing a\nmeagre total of205 for 7, the Indian batsmen were rocked by a searing\nspell from the dreadlocked fast bowler, in which he had the prize\nscalps of Ganguly, Tend ulkar, Dravid and Jadeja-the cream of the\ncrop. Tendulkar was surprised by one that took off nastily and had\nhim groping with his bat held high, to be caught by Grant Flower for\n11. It was Olonga's first match of the tournament and the fact that he\n218\n\nSachin\n\n\fmade a master like Tendulkar look uncomfortable at the crease was\nthe talking point when the two teams met in the final 48 hours later.\nThere was no doubt that Tendulkar's ego had been dented. It was India's fifth tournament title of the year in their\nrecord-breaking fortieth ODI in 1998.\nTendulkar's 124 not out was virtually double that of his partner\nGanguly's contribution (63), a measure ofhis total domination at the\ncrease. Tendulkar's century\nwas his fastest (and the fourth fastest of all), from 71 balls, and had a\nfi. The stand with Ganguly fetched 112 in the\nfirst 15 overs as Tendulkar went hell for leather after a dropped catch\nwhen he was on 53, offleg-spinner Paul Strang who was carted for 45\nruns from his five overs. Forty-one were smashed from Olonga's first\nfour overs, 28 of which came from Tendulkar's bat.\nTendulkar had another world record to his credit-32 Man of the\nMatch awards in 207 matches, against 31 in 187 by Viv Richards. 'Olonga is an\ninternational bowler. He can bowl some good deliveries and he got\nOn Top of the World\n\n219\n\n\fmy wicket.\nLooking back on that triumphant year, Azhar described Tendulkar\nas the team's 'pillar of strength'.\nFollowing his golden year, Tendulkar made an inauspicious start\nto 1999, out for a duck in the first 001 at Taupo.\n\n220\n\nSachin\n.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe second and last quarters of2000 saw two memorable performances\non the domestic circuit by Sachin Tendulkar.\nThe Ranji semi-final against Tamil Nadu had been postponed by\ntwo days to allow Tendulkar to return from Dhaka where he had led\nan Asian XI against a World XI in a one-day exhibition match. Earlier\nthat season, he had relinquished the Mumbai captaincy to Sameer\nDighe since he knew the international calendar would keep him away\nfrom domestic cricket. Tendulkar had come in at the fall of the second wicket at 77,\nand now had only last man Santosh Saxena for company.\nThere is a remarkable sequence offour photographs ofTendulkar,\ntaken by Vivek Bendre (Sporlstar, 29 April2000), showing him exulting\nafter guiding Mumbai to the first innings lead. It\nshowed his commitment to Mumbai cricket. Tendulkar\nhimself felt it was one of his besl. This time Tendulkar's contribution was\n53 and 128. He had been the ODI captain under Mark Taylor when\nIndia won the 1998 Test series 2-1 and was determined to keep alive\nhis side's ruthless streak on Indian soil. Even\nTendulkar admitted to 'sledging' Steve Waugh on the field.\nAustralia were without the injured Brett Lee but were still\nformidable, with Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath bowling in\ntandem in India for the first time. India too were without one of their\nspearheads, the injured Ani) Kumble. Tendulkar and\nWarne were immediately sought o\u2022. The only saving\ngrace for India in the ten-wicket trouncing was the batting of\nTendulkar.\nOn the opening day, the Indian batting crumbled to 176 all out.\nThey had lost four wickets at lunch for 55 even as Tendulkar reached\n19 from 53 balls. Mter the break, he opened up and suddenly the\nrampaging bowlers found themselves on the back foot. Tendulkar succumbed yet again to\n280\n\nSachin\n\n\fhis nemesis in the series Down Under. Tendulkar in the\ncompany ofDravid began the rebuilding process. They put on 97 for\nthe third wicket and Tendulkar was at his dazzling best.\nMark Waugh bowled one of his gentle 'offies' and Tendulkar lashed\nout with a ferocious pull.\nHarbhajan was the bowling hero with figures of7 for 123 and 6 for 73.\nTendulkar too played his part.\nSachin's victims were Hayden, Gilchrist and Warne. It was one of the\ngreatest moments in Indian cricket hist01y.\nFour years earlier, Tendulkar had played a decisive innings in the\nfirst Test against Australia at Chennai: 155 not out. This time, his 126\nwould be the side's highest score, though it was Matthew Hayden's\ndouble ton and Harbhajan's 15-wicket haul that took the individual\nhonours in another fantastic finish. With Das, Ramesh and Laxman all going past 50,\nTendulkar did not walk into a crisis as he so often has done in his\ncareer. Colin Miller, bowling seamers\nto Tendulkar and off-spinners to the rest, had the mortification of\nseeing him dropped at 82 on 396 for 4. Miller was immediately smashed\nover long on for six as Tendulkarjumped from 94to 100and two balls\nlater, there was a pull for four.\nNow Tendulkar became the sixth to reach this landmark in his eightysecond Test and the third fastest after Don Bradman (45 Tests) and\nSunil Gavaskar (79 Tests).\nTendulkar had come to the crease on the second ball of the third day\nafter McGrath had Das lbw first ball for 84. For them, Tendulkarwas out, the entertainment for the day\nwas over, and it was time to slip away.\n'Soon, very soon, people will be turning up only to watch Tendulkar\nplay,' R. But when Tendulkar (17) fended\noff a fiery bouncer from the tireless Gillespie to Mark Waugh at slip,\nthe tension around the stadium rose to breaking point. Finally, and fittingly,\nMan of the Series Harbhajan squeezed the winning runs from\nMcGrath with only two wickets in hand. Hayden and Laxman continued their batting heroics, and\nfor Tendulkar the series would bring two very special landmarks.\nIndia won the first game at Bangalore by 60 runs.\nIt was a special moment at Indore for Tendulkar in his two hundred\nand sixty-sixth match (259 innings) as he drove Warne to extra cover\nfor a single. That took him to 34 and he became the first man to score\n10,000 runs in ODis, on his way to his twenty-eighth century. Sunil\nGavaskar in 1987 had achieved a similar feat in Tests.' He seemed to have been\nbiding his time in the over before Warne's, seemingly determined to\n284\n\nSachin\n\n\freach the magic mark off the spinner's bowling.\n-Sachin Tendulkar on the eve of his twentieth anniversary in\ninternational cricket. But,\nperhaps, no player has so often had the whole country in his thrall on\nso many occasions as Sachin Tendulkar.\n'Desert Storm' in 1998; India v Pakistan at Chennai a year later;\nthe World Cup match against Pakistan in 2003; and then December\n2008 when he guided India home against England at Chennai in that\nemotional run-chase.\nThen on 5 November 2009 with a sense ofhistory and timing that\nonly cricket's living legend was capable of, Tendulkar did it again.\nIn the spate of interviews marking his 20th anniversary, there were\ntwo common themes-Tendulkar's childlike enthusiasm and indeed\nhunger for cricket and his plea for Test matches to retain their\nprommence. And\nTendulkar was the focus of attention of both 11 Australians and\ncountless millions of fans in India and around the world.\nThe young left-hander fell for 59 followed by HarabhaJan Singh\nfor a duck and now Tendulkar knew it was all up to him. Tendulkar's\nface said it all as he collected his obligatory Man of the Match award.\nSave for that one brilliant innings, the series had been a quiet one\nfor Tendulkar and India were left to lick their wounds after being\nbeaten 4-2 by a second-string Australia. Though Tendulkar flopped in the first three games that India\nwon (he was rested for the fourth and fifth), he was in majestic form in\nNew Zealand. And Tendulkar played a\nstellar role in both.\nIt was in New Zealand, back in 1994, that Tendulkar had made\nsuch an impact on opening the batting for the first time.\nSaid Kiwi captain Brendan McCullum on Tendulkar's innings:\n)74\n\nSachin\n\n\f'I can hardly remember a shot that didn't come out of the middle .\nIt was Tendulkar's 160 in the first innings and Harbhajan's six\nwickets in the second that made it possible. The 42nd Test century\nwas full of forceful shots and like the Tend ulkar of yore he looked to\ndominate from the start. Five\nwins out of 14 was just not good enough for the most expensive\nfranchise in the league and once again Tendulkar was a\ndisappointment both with his leadership and with the bat scoringjust\ntwo half-centuries in 13 innings. But a finger injury kept Tendulkar out.\nThe Indian total of319 for four was built round a majestic innings\nSuch a Long Journey\n\n375\n\n\fof 138 by Tendulkar which he rated as one of his best.\nTowards the end of2009, the big question now was: how long can\nTendulkar continue.\nWithout saying so in so many words, Tendulkar indicated in\ninterviews in 2009 that his sights were set on the 2011 World Cup to\nbe staged jointly by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.", "Tendulkar_1948": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nAt his home in Australia, the legendary Sir Donald Brad man watched\nSachin Tendulkar on television and saw in his batting a reflection of\nhis own style. The\ninterview was accompanied by split screen shots of Bradman and\nTendulkar and their similar stroke play.\nSir Don played his final Test in 1948. In the decades since, he had\npaid fulsome praise to many batsmen who followed him, notably\nWest Indians Sir Garry Sobers and Sir Vivian Richards, South Mrican\nBarry Richards, and Indian opener Sunil Gavaskar, the only man to\nscore more Test centuries than Brad man himself\nHowever, he obviously felt a special affinity for Tendulkar. They were\nalso both precocious talents, though in this regard Tendulkar made an\nimpact at a much younger age than the Australian legend. For Tendulkar knew that while he could shrug off\nsuch comparisons made by journalists, it was a different matter when\nthe world's greatest batsman himselfwent on record with such a telling\ncomment. Tendulkar also made the point that he would be happy ifhe\n\n\fcould retire with an average half that ofBradman's-an astounding\n99. In fact, at the same stage (52 Tests), Tendulkar's average was\nprecisely half that ofBradman's. Tendulkar: 52 Tests; 79\ninnings; 8 not out; 3534 runs; 49. Naturally, then, there was huge\nexcitement when Sir Don invited Tendulkar to his Adelaide home on\nthe occasion of his ninetieth birthday on 27 August 1998. Tendulkar received special\npermission from BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur to fly to Australia. He also revealed that during the 1991-92 tour\nto Australia, Tendulkar had turned down Gavaskar's invitation to\njoin him on a visit to Sir Don. In the afternoon, Tendulkar and Shane Warne,\nattired in matching suits, dropped by to spend time at Sir Don's home. He spoke and we listened in awe,' Tendulkar\ntold Sanjay Raj an of the Sportstar (2 September 1998) on his return to\nChennai. The meeting lasted for an hour and both Warne and\nTendulkar were pleasantly surprised to learn of Sir Don's high regard\n208\n\nSachin\n\n\ffor the modern game. He said\none-day cricket is attacking and exciting, though he loves Test cricket,'\nsaid Tendulkar.'\nSir Don, in turn, asked Sachin if he moved before the ball left the\nbowler's hand. You begin your movement before the bowler bowls,\notherwise you wouldn't have the time to play the kind of shots you\ndo,' reported Tendulkar in Outlook (12 September 1998). (A year later,\nTendulkar himself spoke ofhis ability to anticipate the bowler's action\ndepending on the previous few deliveries, and even to 'compel' the\nbowler to bowl in a certain way-just as Bradman was said to have\ndone in his own playing days. 'I\nhave had three coaches, one in school, one at the state level and one at\nTest level,' Tendulkar told him.'\nThe second question Tendulkar posed to Sir Don was on his 'mental\npreparation' before a big match. But with Tendulkar the problem is that there are no\nopenings.\"'\nTendulkar's lasting impression was of 'the kindness of that\nremarkable person.' On a\npersonal note, the photograph of Tendulkar, Warne and Sir Don\ntogether-and signed by all three-is the favourite item in my cricket\nmemorabilia collection. The batsman emerged\nthe winner with a bid of $A 4000 (about Rs 100,000).\nWhen Sir Don passed away on the eve of the first India v Australia\nTest at Mumbai in February 2001, Tendulkar and Warne led the tributes\nwith their memories of that August afternoon two years earlier. And it\nemerged a few months later that Sir Don had posthumously paid\nSachin Tendulkar the ultimate compliment.\nTendulkar flew straight from Australia to New Delhi after meeting\nBradman. Surprisingly, for such a cricket-mad nation, Tendulkar\nwas the first cricketer to receive the Khel Ratna, and the only one so far.\nFor some weeks before the function, the private television company\nI was working for was in touch with WorldTel in order to get Tendulkar\ninto the studios for a series ofinterviews. Everything was agreed upon\n210\n\nSachin\n\n\fand we arrived at the Rashtrapati Bhavan with our camera crews,\nready to bring Tendulkar back with us.\nMy colleague and I, and our camera crew, piled into our vehicles\nand followed Tendulkar to the hotel.\nTendulkar was polite but obviously irppatient-wife and shopping\nwere waiting.\n\n212\n\nSachin.", "Tendulkar_1999": "-Sunil Gavaskar\nAt the start of 1999, all the talk in cricket and political circles was\nwhether or not the Pakistanis would make it to India for a Test series\nfor the first time since 1987. On the second\nday, Tendulkar perished to the third ball he faced, caught by Salim\nMalik at gully offSaqlain Mush tag for a rare duck, as he attempted an\nambitious shot. Tendulkar too made a couple of\nimportant breakthroughs by accounting for Inzamam-ui-Haq and\nYousufYouhanna, whom he had dismissed in the first innings, too.\nThat India got so close was almost entirely due to Tendulkar and\nhis partnership of136 for the sixth wicket with Nayan Mongia. With Saqlain\nagain collecting five wickets and Waqar and Wasim striking vital blows,\nIndia were tottering at 82 for 5 when Tendulkar was joined by the\nwicketkeeper. Tendulkar revealed a new facet of his supreme\nbatsmanship-the ability to graft for runs and play a long innings. At the other end, Mongia was\nproviding Tendulkar with admirable support. But by now, Sachin was\nin obvious pain. At the other end, Tendulkar\nwas seething with rage at the sight of the rash shot.\nThirty-sLx runs were added in the company of Sunil Joshi before\nTendulkar, hampered by back spasms, threw away his wicket after an\ninnings spanning 405 minutes and 273 balls. In the despondent Indian dressing room, Tendulkar\nTrauma\n\n223\n\n\fwas a shattered man. I would rate Tendulkar's innings in adverse\ncircumstances above that. Because we know Tendulkar as an attacking\nbatsman. Hazare, Visvanath and Sunil Gavaskar\nproud,' he said (Sportstar, 13 February 1999). Now Tendulkar was nudging them off the\npedestal.\nThere was speculation whether Tendulkar would be able to play. The feeling in the Indian camp was that even a\npartially fit Tendulkar would be a psychological boost to the side after\nhis masterly display at Chepauk. Shoaib\nAkhtar created a sensation by bowling Tendulkar for a first ball duck,\nknocking out his middle stump through sheer pace. The left-handed opener carried\nhis bat for 188, the highest score by a Pakistani in India, while Srinath\nreturned figures of8 for 86 for a match haul of13 wickets.\nOn the fourth day, Tendulkar came to the wicket at 134 for 2,\nopeners Ramesh and VVS. Laxman having put on 108 runs. Instead of\nretreating to the dressing room, Tendulkar stormed into the TWI TV\ncontrol room to watch the replays in the company of match referee\n'Cammie' Smith.\nICC presidentJagmohan Dalmiya, in his own backyard, persuaded\nTendulkar to accompany him round the ground in a bid to pacify the\ncrowd. That was not the case, as Tendulkar had not spotted Akhtar in\nhis path. Reportedly, Pakistan\nmanager Shahryar Khan (a career diplomat) and Pakistan Cricket\nBoard chairman Khalid Mehmood were keen to make the gesture of\ngettiJ1g Tendulkar recalled. VSrivatsa captured\nthe mood well when he wrote in the Times ifIndia: 'Tendulkar is the\nbody and soul of Indian cricket, Every time he gets out cheaply his\nteammates and millions of cricket fans miss a heartbeat or two and\ntoday their hearts must have ached seeing the way he got out. Tendulkar's nineteenth century on the final day\nmust have also been one ofhis easiest (and most unsatisfying), as the\nmatch was dead and buried by then.\nBy now, the strain on Tendulkar's back was going from bad to\nworse. The Pepsi tri-series with\nPakistan and Sri Lanka at home was to be played in March and the\nBCCI was frantically trying to dispel all talk of Tendulkar's injury\nkeeping him out of action-perhaps to keep the sponsors quiet. Once again, India were without\nthe still-resting Tendulkar, and once again they lost in the final to\nPakistan.\nBut there was another honour for Sachin that year. Narayanan. With the\nWorld Cup round the corner, the speculation over Tendulkar's fitness\nreached fever pitch.\n\n228\n\nSachin\n\n.\n-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe World Cup returned to England in 1999 after 16 years. Sachin\nTendulkar was the star-again-with a century. In May 1999, Tendulkar made it to\nthe cover of the Asian edition ofTtme magazine (16 May 1999). But unlike the\nArgentine ace, Tendulkar is a levelheaded, even bland\nprofessional who does all his hell-raising at the wicket. Ask Shane Warne: regarded by most batsmen as\nunplayable, the leg spinner was brutalized by Tendulkar\nthroughout the 1998 Australian tour of India.\nIt's difficult to single out a standout Tendulkar performance,\nas there are so many-and so many to come. India started well after electing to bat first and\nTendulkar (28) and Ganguly (97) put on 67 runs. Tendulkar was\ncaught behind off Lance Klusener,just after striking a delightful cover\ndrive to the boundary. Not only did the Mrican team stun India in a last-over\nthriller, but there was an even more disturbing piece of news for\nTendulkar the night before the game. His father, Dr Ramesh\nTendulkar, had died in Mumbai ofa heart attack in his home in Bandra,\nlate on 18 May, at the age of 66.\nIronically, it was at Leicester (which has a large Indian population)\nthat Dr Tendulkar, ten years earlier, had given a lecture on Marathi\nliterature.Ramesh had the unenviable task of replacing\nTendulkar at the top of the order and he did a more than competent\njob as he top-scored with 55. Tendulkar was a family affair\nwith just a few close friends (Vinod Kambli and Amol Muzumdar)\nand Mumbai cricket officials in attendance.\nTendulkar', Sunil Gavaskar wrote in the Times ifindia (28 May 1999):\nThe late Ramesh Tendulkar did not watch too many ofhis son,\nSachin's innings at a cricket ground.\nGavaskar recalled how Prof Tendulkar (when he was teaching at\nSidharth College in the 1960s and 1970s) helped the cricketers of\nBombay University. So when young Tendulkar started to bat\nthe way he does, plenty of people who knew about the senior\nTendulkar's contribution were sure it was God's way of rewarding\nhim with a son as talented as Sachin.'\nPro\u00a3 Tendulkar had last been seen in public with Sachin and Anjali\nat a cricket awards function in Mumbai a month before his death.\nAtmaram 'Bapu' Bhende, the doyen ofMarathi theatre, had known\nPro\u00a3 Tendulkar for many decades. (In September 2001, when I metAJit Tendulkar\nin Mumbai and told him of the relationship, his reaction was, 'Bapu.\nMr Bhende recalled in a letter sent to me in November 2001, how\nhe first met Ramesh Tendulkar when he invited him to attend a kavi\nsammelan (poets' meet) organized by the Indian National Theatre (of\nwhich he was secretary of the Marathi section) in the mid-1950s.\nRamesh Tendulkar was helpful in identifying such poets and\ncontacting them . Those who knew Ramesh Tendulkar\nintimately, know that Sachin's modesty is a gift from his father.'\nTendulkar added, 'The entire country wanted me to play. A full house at Bristol (8508) gave Tendulkar\nthree standing ovations-first when he walked to the crease, then\nwhen he reached his twenty-second century, and finally when he\nwalked off with fellow centurion Rahul Dravid at the end oflndia's\ninnings of 329 for 2-Tendulkar on 140 and Dravid on 104. Sachin's previous\nODI centuries had all come when he was opening.'\nLess than three years later, another tragedy would cast its shadow\nover Tendulkar's life. The big breakthrough came when Glenn McGrath\nhad Tendulkar caught behind for his first duck in 22 innings, with\njust one run on the board. Tendulkar was\nback in the opener's slot and blazed briefly for 45. In\nbetween, there were some wonderful moments, notably Tendulkar's\ncentury against Kenya and the victories over England and Pakistan.\nTendulkar's form too was patchy.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nBy October 1999, Sachin Tendulkar was back in the team after his\nenforced break. Tendulkar was joined by a new coach, Kapil Dev, who\nhad taken over from Anshuman Gaekwad. Kapil Dev had been with\nTendulkar in his debut series, in Pakistan in 1989, and the two were\nknown to be close. Tendulkar ( 18) was one of only three batsmen to reach double\nfigures.Ramesh in the second innings. This\ntime, the top five all crossed 50 and two reached double figuresRahul Dravid and the captain himself At times, it appeared Tendulkar\nwas batting from memory. Tendulkar's twentieth\ncentury was a sketchy one, perhaps due to lack ofbatting practice.\nThe third and final Test at Ahmedabad should have been a triumph\nfor both Tendulkar and the team. Instead, after scoring his first Test\ndouble century in a decade, Tendulkar courted controversy by his\nrefusal to enforce a follow-on after leading by 275 runs.Ramesh\nout for 110and Tendulkar batting on 104. The 281 stand with Tendulkar for the fourth wicket was an Indian\nrecord and the team declared at 583 for 7.\nThere had been talk earlier that Tendulkar had neither the stamina\nnor the application to convert his bagful of Test tons into. It was\n246\n\nSachin\n\n\fanother psychological breakthrough, overtaking his previous highest\nof179 against the West Indies at Nagpur in 1994.\nThis was the same ground where Sunil Gavaskar became the first to\nreach 10,000 runs and where Kapil Dev broke Sir Richard Hadlee's\nworld Test wicket record.'\nSunil Gavaskar's Indian record of236 not out was in sight when\nTendulkar was dismissed by a brilliant catch, shortly after tea on the\nsecond day. Viswanath in the Hindu (2 November 1999).com (3\nNovember 1999): 'The last thing Test cricket needs is this approach\nby the Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar. 'It really shocked me that Tendulkar appeared to have to\nbe cajoled by Kapil Dev before he did finally declare. He justified his strategy in an interview with\nVijay Lokapally (Spottstar, 20 November 1999):\nJust spare a thought for the bowlers.\nTendulkar finished the series with a 100-plus average and got\nanother chance to gorge himself on the mediocre Kiwi attack in the\none-day series that followed. India's 376 for 2 was the sewnd highest ODI total\nof all time and the stand of 331 for the second wicket in 46 overs\n248\n\nSachin\n\n\fbetween Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar was the biggest ever partnership.\nGanguly missed out on the run riot when bowler Shayne O'Connor\ndeflected Tendulkar's firm push on to the non-striker's stumps, with\nthe batsman out of his ground, in the second over. Tendulkar carried\nhis bat, in the process erasing Ganguly's previous Indian highest of\n183 against Sri Lanka in the 1999 World Cup. Tomorrow, someone may break the record\nbut people would remember me for the contribution I made in\nwinning the match for India.\nFor Tendulkar and his men, the real test was round the corner in\nAustralia, where the world Test and ODI champions were waiting.", "Tendulkar_2000": " Tendulkar would also tell the CB. It was obvious that Tendulkar and Kapil Dev were trying to\nforge a united front against the selectors.\nThe captain wanted Mumbai left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni in\nthe squad, reinforcing the widely held belief that Tendulkar veered\ntowards players from his own side. Tendulkar had made a huge impact on his previous tour\nDown Under in 1991-92, with his brilliant centuries at Sydney and\nPerth, while still a teenager. Tendulkar fell into both c1tegories and he was made to\npay a heavy price.\nThe high esteem in which Tendulkar is held by Australian cricket\nfollowers was best illustrated when Sachin was introduced to Sachin\nVoigt at the Adelaide Oval, venue of the first Test. The seven-year-old\nhad been named by his father Ian Voigt following Tendulkar's exploits\non the previous tour to Australia. 'Dear Sachin, keep smiling, Sachin\nTendulkar,' Tendulkar signed on the mini-bat presented by his young\nnamesake who had waited patiently for three hours to meet his hero.\nThat would be about the last pleasant memory of Adelaide for\nTendulkar. It did not help matters\nthat Tendulkar was the victim, in both innings, of hotly debated\ndecisions handed out by Australian umpire Daryl Harper, which only\nadded to the growing suspicion that he was being unfairly targeted.\nReplying to Australia's 441, the Indians were 123 for 4 at close on the\nsecond day, with Tendulkar and Ganguly both on 12. The skirmish\nbetween McGrath and Tendulkar on the second evening had been\nbrief but captivating. Now Tendulkar, coming in at a shockingly low\nnumber five in the order, was in a rare defensive mood as he batted for\n89 minutes and 69 balls for 12 runs. Having weathered that\nstorm, it was a different Tendulkar who took charge on the third\nmornmg. Tendulkar's 49 came from 64 balls and he was just getting\ninto his stride when he was adjudged to have been caught bat and pad\nat short leg offWarne for 61. 'I was disappointed that I got\nout,' was Tendulkar's terse comment. If the Tendulkar episode took away the sheen from the Aussie\nvictory the fault lay with the umpire. But before that, Tendulkar enthralled one and all with\nhis third century Down Under and his fifth against Australia in 11\nTests. Mter Australia once again crossed 400 in their first innings, India\nwere struggling at 235 for 9 at the end of the third day, with Tendulkar\nholding the batting together with his twenty-second Test century. Lee bowled lightning quick and\nDebacle Down Under\n\n253\n\n\fonly Tendulkar-now batting at number four-managed to defy his\nhostile pace.\nIt appeared as if there was a game within the game going on in the\nmiddle: Tendulkar v Australia. As the world celebrated the dawn of the new\nmillennium, Tendulkar must have looked back at 1999 with decidedly\nmixed feelings: His father's death, India's disappointing World Cup\nperformance, his back worries, the captaincy drama and the miseries\nin Australia . There was a brief flash of brilliance in\nTendulkar's first-innings 45 as he once again duelled with McGrath. It was the third ti:ne in five\ninnings that Tendulkar had got the short end of the stick from the\numpires.\n254\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's disappointment at the end of the Test was heightened\nby anger over the behaviour of the two umpires on the final day.\nBut the umpires ignored Tendulkar's plea to step in. At the post-match\npress conference, Man of the Series Tendulkarwas livid.\n'In all the years that I have known Tendulkar-and I have known\nhim since he was 14--1 have never known him to be as worked up at\na press conference,' said Harsha Bhogle who pinpointed Hair's attitude\ntowards Asian teams as the crux of the problem. Tendulkar was asked\nafter the series ifhe felt the umpires had targeted him, but he refused\nto be drawn, saying it was probably a coincidence. Coward, a man with a deep affection for\nIndian cricket and cricketers, wrote an impassioned open letter to\nTendulkar in the Weekend Australian (8-9 January 2000).\nSachin, you are recognized throughout the cricket world as a\nthoughtful, self-effacing, intelligent young man of great\nintegrity and quiet dignity.\nSachin, you are in a powerful position.' Perhaps Tendulkar was taking shelter under\nthe ICC Code of Conduct regarding comments, but there comes\na time when the good of cricket counts before anything else\nand one has to stick one's neck out for the betterment of the\ngame. For, when Tendulkar speaks the world will stop and listen. India's failure was largely\nput down to Tendulkar's poor run. Pakistan's young all-rounder Abdul Razzaq accused\nTendulkar of tampering with the ball in the Adelaide game on 26\nJanuary.\nIn that match in Perth, Tendulkar received yet another terrible\ndecision, given out caught behind offWaqar Younis by umpire Simon\nTaufel for 17.\nHere Tendulkar got his way, with Mumbai teammate Sameer\nDighe flying out to replace the disappointing M. 'The\nplane bringing Azhar to Australia will be the same one taking Kapil\nand me back home,' Tendulkar is reported to have told his teammates.\nBut before the team could be announced, Tendulkar walked into\nthe press box at the Brabourne Stadium to make a dramatic\nannouncement ofhis own. Tendulkar stonewalled the more sensitive ones and left the\nbox. Perhaps a loose understanding was reached between\nTendulkar, Ganguly andJadeja at the World Cup, that whoever was\nmade captain would resign if Mohammad Azharuddin was picked;\nperhaps Tendulkar arrived with two letters in his pocket for the selection\nmeeting, one with the team he wanted, the other his resignation. The third theory\nwas that Tendulkar decided to quit after the Test series so that his\nconfidant Jadeja could take over as captain since India were to play\nonly one-day cricket till November. I think the player\nTendulkar is more etTective than the captain-player Tendulkar.com after Ganguly was eventually appointed to\nsucceed Tendulkar, this is how Wadekar assessed the man on whose\nshoulders he had thrust the captaincy just eight months earlier:\nI'm convinced that Sachin will never lead the Indian side in\nfuture.\nSachin also leads from the front.\nTendulkar was criticized for delaying his resignation till the day\nthe team was chosen with Azhar in it. Was it a cop-out to\navoid a backlash over Tendulkar's resignation.\nA survey of former players, including former captains Bishan Singh\nBedi, K.Srikkanth and Sunil Gavaskar found them backing\nTendulkar's decision.\nTendulkar was the only batsman to look comfortable on a bowlerfriendly wicket at Mumbai.\nThe defeat meant Tendulkar had lost five Tests in a row as captain.\nMter failing in the first three oms, Tendulkar came good with his\ntwenty-fifth ton at Baroda as India won by four wickets to take an\nunbeatable 3-1lead in the series. This followed Prabhakar naming Kapil as the\nman who, he claimed, had offered him a bribe to throw a match in Sri\nLanka in 1994. Tendulkar's 93\nagainst Sri Lanka was made out of a total of205, chasing a target of\n277. Tendulkar (38) decided to take on McGrath and not only with\nhis bat. He even\noffensively demonstrated to Tendulkar how to play a stroke. In Australia they had\nbeen able to dictate terms, with Tendulkar on the defensive. In McGrath's first over Tendulkar tried to take one\nfrom outside off and hit over mid wicket. On the next ball, back he came\ndown the track for another smashing drive on the up through midoff As McGrath stopped in his tracks, Tendulkar took a few steps\nforward, and very clearly stared at McGrath and said, 'Just fuck off. It was a very different Tendulkar we saw\nthat day . This time\nGanguly carried his bat for 141 while Tendulkar's contribution was\n39. Tendulkar\nwas run out after a mix-up, for 69.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nTendulkar's stand on the match-fixing controversy and the subsequent\nCBI probe and report has been consistent from the start. That Tendulkar was\nsacked from the captaincy and Azhar restored to the position shortly\nafterwards is just another bitterly ironic chapter in the history oflndian\ncricket. Tendulkar replied, 'It's a very touchy\ntopic and I wouldn't like to go into it. In return, he was\nasked to introduce the bookie to key players in the side, including\ncaptain Tendulkar. He met Tendulkar for an interview in\nGeorgetown, Guyana, at the end of which he asked the captain for his\nreaction to the bookie's offer. While the BCCI brushed aside the story in public,\nunknown to Magazine himself, a letter was faxed to Tendulkar midway\nthrough the West Indies tour, asking him who the bookie was who\nhad offered him the money.\nTendulkar confronted Magazine with this revelation at the nets\nbefore the Independence Cup match in Chennai against Pakistan in\nMay 1997.\nHis voice [Tendulkar's] was a mixture ofanger and hurt.' It took only these few words from me for Tendulkar to\ncalm down. 'The Board had taken the \"I\" in your story to be me\n[Tendulkar] ,' he said.\"'\nMter the match was over, it was agreed between Tendulkar, Madan\nLal and Magazine that the journalist would write a letter to the Board,\nclarifying the matter. In his letter Magazine wrote: 'I fail to understand\nhow Tendulkar's name was linked with the bookie when my story\nwas clear and at no stage did it even hint that the bookie had met\nTendulkar.' He added something to the effect that Tendulkar was not\nonly a great player but also a great ambassador for the country and\nshould be left alone to concentrate on his game.\nBut two points concerning Tendulkar stood out: firstly, Prabhakar\nrefused to trap Tendulkar on video despite pressure from those at the\nweb site; he said he had too much respect for him.\nThere remained the question mark over Tendulkar's decision to\nnot enforce a follow-on in the third Test against New Zealand at\nAhmedabad.\nTendulkar was spared the ordeal. It would be relevant here to quote\npassages from the em report directly concerning Tendulkar, which\nwas released to the media on 1 November 2000.)\nDr Ali Irani (pages 71-76):\nDr Irani stated that he had never heard anything adverse\nregarding Tendulkar. In fact, in most of the matches where\nfixing was taking place, the clue was that the game would be\n'on' only when Tendulkar got 'out' because he was one player\nwho could single-handedly win the match and upset any\ncalculation.\nSachin Tendulkar (pages 88---89):\nSachin Tendulkar, former Indian captain, when asked about\nthe India-New Zealand Test at Ahmedabad in 1999, stated that\nby the end of third day's play when New Zealand had lost\naround 6 wickets, he had thought to himself that he would\nenforce the follow-on the next day.\nBy July 2001, the dust had settled on the controversy, but Tendulkar\ncontinued to be guarded in his response.\n276\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar replied, 'The whole team was shocked because none\nof us could ever think of it.", "Tendulkar_2001": "Foot Fault\n\nThere cannot be another Sachin Tendulkar.

In a rare critique of Tendulkar, he\ncame down on him for throwing away his wicket in the defeat in the\nsecond Test at Harare.

During the last league match against the West Indies\nat Harare on 4 July, when he scored his twenty-ninth ODI century,\nSachin had felt a sharp pain in his foot while setting offfor a single. The 'click' that\nTendulkar had heard was most likely of his tiny toe bone (known as\nthe 'medial sesamoid') snapping. Tendulkar felt there may have been\nmore pressure on the area due to the spike-studded sole ofhis custommade shoes. Initially, it was hoped\nTendulkar would miss only the oms and would be fit in time for the\nTest series.\n'Sachin could have played the Test series only at the risk offurther\ninjury. For a few days, the whole country watched\nas Tendulkar's fractured toe and Prime Minister Vajpayee's worn out\nknee competed for space in the media.\nTendulkar had missed some one-day matches just before and after\nthe 1999 World Cup due to back pain. There was just one Indian\nand one contemporary player among the twelve named and that was\nTendulkar, one of Sir Don's favourites. The young Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag was asked\nto open the innings after Yuvraj Singh and Arnay Khurasiya had failed\nin that position.\nRemarkably similar in height, build and looks, Sehwag also\ndisplayed an array of attacking shots normally the preserve of\nTendulkar, whose batting spot he had taken in his hero's enforced\nabsence. Tendulkar thrilled Schwag by sending a message of\ncongratulations.\nThe 'New Tendulkar', they were already calling him. Sehwag, though,\nwould have none of it. Look at the\namount of cricket he has played, and see what I have played in\ncomparison. Just see how many matches he's won for India. There cannot be another\nSachin Tcndulkar,' he told TapanJoshi ofCrU:ketnext.-Sachin Tendulkar\nThe latter half of2001 was to see one controversy after another-not\nall of his own making--dogging Sachin Tendulkar's footsteps. This angered both\nTendulkar and Dr Joshi, the BCCI doctor who he had been consulting\nafter his return from Zimbabwe. Shockingly, none of\nTendulkar's 25 Test tons (until then) got into the list. 'Tendulkar needs to play more\ngreat innings in future to make the list,' he said. Laxman was the highest\nranked Indian on the list, at number six, for his stupendous 281 against\nAustralia at Kolkata earlier that year. Nirmal Shekhar in the Sportstar\n(11 August 2001) raised the pertinent point: 'Surely, you cannot\npenalize a genius [Tendulkar] for the mediocrity around him. The front line\nbowlers this time were Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Colin Miller\nand Warne. The launch ofWisden Cricket Asia magazine in December 2001\nand the Wisden.\n\n\fNot only did Tendulkar not find a place in the top 100 of all time,\nbut he also did not make it to the Indian Top Ten. For, coming in at number ten was\nAjit Wadekar's 143 in the third Test against New Zealand at Wellington\nin 1968.126-84-8 and Bishan Singh Bedi's match figures of34.\nIn February 2002, the list of top 100 One-day International batting\nand bowling performances was announced. (His bowling figures of5 for 35 against Australia at\nKochi in 1998 came in at number 35). While the team was heavily criticized (Sunil\nGavaskar expressed his doubts as to whether Bradman himself had\nmade the selection), there was little dispute over Tendulkar's inclusion\nin the side.\nIn the chapter on Tendulkar in Perry's bookBradman's Best, Perry\nemphasized Sir Don's fascination with Tendulkar's batting. 'Rradman\nnever missed a chance to see Tendulkar from then [when he first saw\nand commented on his batting] until the end of the 1999 three-match\nTest series in Australia,' wrote Perry. Perry adds that by mid-1998, after\nwatching Tendulkar destroy Australia in Tests and one-day games in\nYear of Controversies\n\n295\n\n\fIndia, Bradman ranked him with Barry Richards, Arthur Morris and\nGarry Sobers. 'Not long after that series against Australia, Tendulkar\nreceived the invitation of a lifetime to join Shane Warne in meeting\nBradman at his Kensington Park home in Adelaide on his 90th birthday.\nTendulkar was honoured to be told by Bradman that he was today's\nbest batsman.'\nMter the meeting Brad man told Perry how impressed he was with\nTendulkar and how he expected him to go on to even greater\nachievements.'\nMuch to everyone's relief, Tendulkar was fit for the tour to South\nMrica where India were to play three Tests and a one-day tri-series\nwith Kenya.' he was asked by\nVijay Lokapally (Sportstar, 29 September 2001). Tendulkar and Ganguly had two century opening stands\nand in the process rewrote two records set by the great West Indian\nopening pair of Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes. It was Tendulkar's first international match in three months and\nhe celebrated his return with 101. This time, Ganguly and Tendulkar ensureJ there would\nbe no escape route for Kenya, with their world-record partnership. It was the\nninth final in a row that the Indians had lost and questions were now\nbeing asked about Tendulkar's form in crunch games.\nSachin 'lendulkar was now joined by Virender Sehwag who was\nplaying his first Test; they were the last recognized batting pair at the\ncrease. There\nfollowed a savage counter-attack from Tendulkar and the 'new\nTendulkar'. Tendulkar\ntook 17 balls to score his first run; the next 101 came from 97 as he\nunleashed a range of savage shots, including one he had rarely used,\nthe slash over the slips. India finished the opening day at 372 for 7,\nTendulkar out for 155 and Sehwag (1 05)-now dubbed the 'NaJafgarh\nSachin' -becoming the eleventh Indian to score a century on Test\ndebut. At the end of the day's play, Tendulkar refused to rate his twentysixth Test century, saying 'a hundred is a hundred and each has his\nown place.' That was\nseen as Tendulkar's way oflessening the pressure on his 23-year-old\nteammate.\nWhen Sehwagjoined him at the crease, Tendukar's words to the\ndebutant had put him at ease. Tendulkar and Sehwag in\ntheir first big stand together made onlookers rub their eyes in\nbewilderment. Pradeep Magazine was quick to point\nthis out in the Hindustan Times (5 November 2001): 'He [Sehwag]\nhas something more as well: strokes which remind everyone of\nTendulkar.com India editor Sambit\nBal to rank it third after Sachin's 1992 century at Perth and the 1999\nChennai tun against Pakistan.\n'Tendulkar has to perform more consistently on bouncy wickets\nin South Mrica and Australia to lay claim to be the best batsrran in the\nworld along with Brian Lara,' South Mrican legend Barry Richards\nhad said a couple of months earlier, labelling him 'a good batsman\nYear of Controversies\n\n299\n\n\fonly at home'. This was Tendulkar's answer to Richards, if one was\nneeded.\nSix players-captain Sourav Ganguly, Deep Dasgnpta, Shiv\nSundar Das, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag and Sachin\nTendulkar-were slapped with sentences of varying degrees.\nMost shocking was the charge against Tendulkar. Denness claimed\nTendulkar, during his bowling spell, had tampered with the ball on\nthe third day. Match Referee's decision: By acting on the match\nball, Tendulkar brought the game into disrepute (Icc Players\nand Team officials Code No. Tendulkar\nhimself had been at the receiving end of such behaviour, particularly\nfrom the Australians. What made the charge against Tendulkar\nparticularly ludicrous, even invalid, was that it had not been brought\nto the notice of the match referee by the two on-field umpires as per\nthe law.\nInstead, it was a South Mrican TV producer who instructed his\ncameraman to focus on Tendulkar as he cleaned the seam of the ball of\nmud and grass on a wet day.com)\nTechnically, Tendulkar was at fault.\nTendulkar's form after that blazing 155 in the first innings of the\nfirst Test was something of a let-down. Now, with\nTendulkar under a cloud, the English and Australian media got a\nchance to hit back.\nOn 17 December in Bangalore, Tendulkar in his first statement\nfollowing his penalty, clarified that he was indeed trying to clean the\nball and never intended to do 'anything wrong'. Writing in the Cricketer\nInternational Oanuary 2002), Barnes drew parallels between what Sir\nDon Bradman meant to Australia in the 1930s and 1940s and\nTendulkar's place in modern India. He also revealed that he had been\ntold by that doyen of cricket writers, John Woodcock, that he felt\nTendulkar was as good a batsman as Bradman. In India's\nnationalistic climate, Tendulkar stands for Indian aspiration and India's\ndesire to fling off subservience and take a new station in the world. Dravid, at the\nvital number three slot, had a new burden to bear: he was coming in\njust before Tendulkar.\nMost of the English mediamen were watching Tendulkar play at\nhome for the first time. The build up to the series in the English press\nhad almost solely focussed on Tendulkar and h;s place in Indian cricket\nand Indian society.\nThe huge hype surrounding Tendulkar obviously had an effect\non the English players too, for they appeared to be initially overawed\nin his presence. Tendulkar came in with the score at 212 for 3. Tendulkar's freeflowing stroke play was stifled and he faced 144 balls before being\ncaught behind off the persistent Hoggard for 88. India lost\n4 wickets for 93 before Tendulkar and Laxman's century stand hauled\nthem back. Tendulkar was not flustered,\nthough, and got his runs steadily though not particularly quickly.\nAnother 11 followed from off-spinner Richard Dawson's over and\nTendulkar got to his almost inevitable century with a savage pull off\nHoggard. Now only Bradman (29) and\nGavaskar (34) were ahead of him. Behind the delay-no team had scored 300-plus\nto win a Test in India-was the fear in the England captain's mind of\nanother flurry of runs from Tendulkar. Hussain's obsession with Tendulkar had\nbecome all-consuming.\nFormer England captain Mike Brearley summed up quite\nbeautifully in the Guardian (16 December 2001), the special place\nTendulkar enjoys in India: 'Perhaps it is in his Hindu roots that\nTendulkar finds the peace of mind to carry without either arrogance\nor panic the load of national fervour that lands on his stocky shoulders. The bowler entrusted with keeping\nTendulkar on a leash was the tall left-arm spinner Ashley Giles. Giles\noperated to a leg-side line with a packed on-side field, bowling over\nthe wicket in the rough behind Tendulkar's legs in order to frustrate\nhim.\nBut his Bodyline II tactics against Tendulkar took the fun out of\ncricket,' he wrote. Tendulkar made a mockery once again of the offstump line ofEngland's pace attack, forcing Hussain to change tactics\nand switch the field. Not that Tendulkar was in\nany mood to appreciate it at the time.\nBy the close of the truncated second day, Tendulkarwas on 50. It was one of the very rare occasions when\nTendulkar was seen to lose his temper on the field of play.\nTendulkar was joined at the crease by Sehwag. Admittedly, the 'new Tendulkar' was living\ndangerously.\nHis ego piqued by this audacious display-perhaps all the talk of\nthe 'new Tendulkar' was getting on his nerves-the role model decided\nto finally chance his arm. That the batsman in these\ninstances was Sachin Tendulkar hardly needs saying. Tendulkar is the\nmodern master of batting. IfTcndulkar has\nany sense he'll bat till Christmas. Tendulkar gives the\nbowlers a chance and he is human.\nWith a terrific performance at Ahmedabad they proved to\nthemselves that they could match 10 of the Indian team but\nadmitted the 11th, Tendulkar, had the wood on them.\nNot surprisingly, Tendulkar was the Man of the Series with 307\nruns at 76. In the third match at Chennai, they hammered 107 in the first\n19 overs; at Kanpur in the next it was 134 in 18, Tendulkar scoring 87\nnot out from 67 balls and Schwag 82 from 62.\n\n310\n\nSachin.\nGlobal Brand\n\nTendulkar works. -Hemant Kenkre\nWhen Sachin Tendulkar was signed up by World Tel chief Mark\nMascarenhas in October 1995 for a five-year deal (starting in 1996)\nworth $7.\nIt was a shattering blow for Tendulkar. 'I met\nhim as an agent, but he became a very close friend of mine,' said\nTendulkar.'\nTendulkar flew between one-day matches to Bangalore, where he\ndelivered a moving eulogy at St. 'He was like my\nelder brother,' Tendulkar said at the 40-minute service, attended by a\nlarge gathering.\nThe renewal of the contract with Tendulkar was seen as the last\nchance to salvage his business. It was\na measure of the faith Tendulkar had in him. 'I don't believe in what\nhas been said about Mark,' Tendulkar said in an interview, shortly\nafter renewing the deal.\nIn an interview shortly after Tendulkar's contract was renewed in\n2001, Mascarenhas said he was initially attracted by the 'angelic\nquality' of his star client, evident in the few commercials he shot\nbefore 1995.\nIt was Ravi Shastri who first introduced Tendulkar to Mascarenhas\nin a Bangalore pub.' In 1995,\nTendulkar was considered to be in the second rung of cricket's\nsuperstars, a shade behind Brian Lara and Shane Warne. But the\nGlobal Brand\n\n313\n\n\fTendulkar mania went from strength to strength in the intervening\nyears and the Bangalore-born maverick businessman got handsome\nreturns on his canny investment.\nThe brands Tendulkar currently endorses represent a wide variety\nof products. Never mind that Tendulkar's\nfavourite cars are his two Mercedes Benz luxury models (a silver SL600\nand a maroon C36 AMG600-he has a passion for driving them\nhimself).\nReportedly, Tendulkar's contract is worth Rs 3 crorcs per year.\nIt's doubtful whether Tendulkar has ever ridden a two-wheeler,\nexcept perhaps bicycles in his schooldays. This is what\nPadamsee told me about the Tendulkar marketing phenomenon:\n'When a cricketer achieves the status of Don Bradman, he becomes a\nglobal brand.' Tendulkar was asked by Sanjay\nKarhade in the Times if India Sunday Review (10 June 2001).\nThere is no doubt that companies that sign on Tendulkar for\nastronomical sums get more than their money's worth.\nInterviewed for the same article, marketing man Hemant Kenkre\n(Tendulkar's captain at the CCI in the late 1980s) had this to say:\n'Sachin's a real person, someone who delivers imagery with attitudenot some \"make believe\" screen persona who acts a part.\nTendulkar works. Tendulkar is thus free to concentrate on\ncricket. Sachin, of course, has the final say. 'Is there a parallel to\nTendulkar on the cricket field. So judge it from there,' was his\ncomment in Mid Day (17 May 2001) when asked, 'Would you say this\ndeal will be unparalleled in the history of world cricket.\nTendulkar's stature in the Indian team had by now matured into\nthat of senior statesman.

The team had a fresh, youthful look to it-it was, as Raj Singh\nwould describe it, the 'team for the 90s'. Tendulkar scored 13, 47, 4\n(not out) and 30 in the two warm-up games prior to the first Test at\nLancaster Park, Christchurch.\nIt was a miserable batting performance by the visitors in the first\nTest at Christchurch as they were beaten by ten wickets with Tendulkar\nout for his first duck in Test cricket, in the first innings. Of the Indian\nplayers, only Kapil Dev had previous playing experience in New\nZealand. India crumbled to 164 all out in reply to New Zealand's 459\nand, following on, could muster only 296 (Tendulkar: 24). Sir Richard\nHadlee became the first bowler in Test cricket to reach the landmark\nof 400 wickets when he bowled Manjrekar in the second innings.\nHadlee was arguably the best bowler in the world at the time and\nfacing him at such an early stage of his career was an education for\nSachin.\nMter that early setback, the Indian batting clicked in the second\nTest at Napier where over two days were lost to rain and a draw was the\n\n\fonly verdict possible. W V Raman was out to Hadlee off the first ball\nof the match and it was Prabhakar (95) and Manjrekar (42) who did\nthe early repair work, adding 92 for the second wicket.

Sachin had batted\nfor 324 minutes, faced 266 balls and hit four boundaries. The entire team consoled me,'\nsaid Sachin.' (Sports Channel video,\nDecember 1990)\n'I had two feelings when I caught him,' recalls Wright, now coach\nof the Indian team. 'Firstly one of relief, as at the time I was captain of\nNew Zealand and he was batting so beautifully we looked like we\n54\n\nSachin\n\n\fwould never get him out. It was the second Test and we had won the\nfirst. My second feeling was one of almost feeling sorry for him as he\nwas only a lad really and he had batted so well and deserved a century.'\n'[Sachin's innings] left experienced members of the New Zealand\nteam agog,' wrote Don Neely, the convenor of the New Zealand\nselection panel, in the New Zealand CricketAlmanack (1991 ).\nThe third Test at Auckland, a high-scoring match in which\nTendulkar could score only five, was also drawn and New Zealand\nwon the series 1-0.

These were his first runs in One-day Internationals. Tendulkar was once again dropped for the\nmatch and Australia won by eight wickets to complete an unsuccessful\ntour for the Indians. It was a disappointing tournament for both\nSachin and the team as India lost both its league matches, to Sri Lanka\nand Pakistd. Sachin\nscored 10 (run out) and 20 in the two games.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of 1990. India were to play three Tests and two\nOne-day Internationals apart from two months of first-class and oneday games against the counties. After scoring 19 in the opening cneday match against League Cricket Conference at Sunderland,\nTendulkar was rested for the first county game versus Yorkshire at\nHeadingley. Against Hampshire he had scores of32 and 58 not out as\nthe Indians lost by seven wickets.\nWith the first Texaco series om on 18 July, Sachin ran into form\nand followed the unbeaten half-century against Hampshire with\nscores of92 and 70 (v Kent); 65 (v Minor Counties); and 10 not out (v\nScotland). Even the great players of the\ngame would have been proud of that,' he said in appreciation (Indian\nCruketAnnual, 1990).\n\n\fSachin's knocks of 92 and 70 against Kent at Canterbury were\nsignificant as they were the first for him in the role of opener. According\nto manager and former Test stumper Madhav Mantri, Sachin had\nvolunteered for the slot, keeping the team's interests in mind. The\nIndians won the game by seven wickets. Kumble struck t\\vo telling blows at this stage and India were\nback in the game. Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. h the end, England's\ntotal of229 all out (in the last of the 55 overs) was a credit to the Indian\nbowlers' persistence. Gooch was bowled cheaply.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. India\nHail the Boy King\n\n57\n\n\fneeded 145 runs from the last 20 overs to win and got them in some\nstyle, thanks in part to a delightful little innings of 31 from 26 balls\n(two fours) by Tendulkar. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India.\nIn the first Test at Lord's, Azharuddin won the toss and asked Gooch\nto bat first. Later in the match,\nGooch had another opportunity to be grateful to Indian generosity\nwhen, on 36, he edged medium-pacer Sanjeev Sharma behind and\nMore floored a straightforward chance.\nFrom the very first day India was fighting to save a Test which\ncould have turned out very differently if not for a startling bit of\nmisjudgement by their captain. Lamb\nraced to 139 at more than a run a ball, his partnership of 308 with\nGooch an all-wicket record for England against India. Mter adding 192 with\nRobin Smith, he was out to a tired stroke, bowled by Prabhakar for\n333. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1991) called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47.\nThe second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which started on 9\nAugust would finally see the promise of youth translate into a display\nof greatness-a match-saving century from the youngest Test cricketer\nin the world. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on 322\nfor 3, inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. Smith\nweighed in with a ton and England's massive score of519 once again\nmeant that India could only hope to save the Test match. His 179 was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n60\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from 100 balls. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. But not too\nyoung to save his side in battle, overshadowing his teammates, some\nalmost twice his age, who had recklessly thrown away their wickets\non the final day. And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for 225 minutes, faced 189 balls\nand struck 17 boundaries. It made him at 17 years and 112 days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune 1996), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October 1990). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over 30 books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n62\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred. Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored 68 in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make 119 not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing 160. He was only 17 years and 112 daysthe second-youngest Test centurion, after Mushtaq Mohammadand we wondered what he might be capable of doing in the next ten\nyears or so. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. In his second-innings century\nTendulkar escaped a chest-high caught-and-bowled to off-spinner\nEddie Hemmings when he was only 10. But\nyoung Tendulkar stood solid, and so did Prabhakar. He saw India to safety,\nand half-an-hour later, he was stepping forward in the pavilion to\nreceive his Man of the Match award.\" The young prodigy had helped India\nturn the tide in the match, transforming the seemingly inevitable\ndisappointment of millions into jubilation at his wondrous act.\"'\nSaid Richie Benaud on TV after Tendulkar had received his award\nfrom David Lloyd: We'll see a lot more centuries from his bat.' Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his 20s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries. One such must have\nbeen acutely embarrassing to Sachin himself.\nMter all that excitement, the third and final Test at the Oval was\n64\n\nSachin\n\n\falmost anticlimactic. This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country.\n(India's first Test victory in England was at the Oval in 1971. AJI but number ten Hirwani reached double figures\nand there were 50s for Azhar and More as well. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch (80 in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten 157 by David Gower. Tendulkar was third in the averages with 245\nruns at 61. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score 388 in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with 108 not out.\nThe tour of England was a huge step forward in the cricket\neducation ofTendulkar.\n\n66\n\nSachin.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of 1990.

Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. h the end, England's\ntotal of229 all out (in the last of the 55 overs) was a credit to the Indian\nbowlers' persistence. Gooch was bowled cheaply.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. India\nHail the Boy King\n\n57\n\n\fneeded 145 runs from the last 20 overs to win and got them in some\nstyle, thanks in part to a delightful little innings of 31 from 26 balls\n(two fours) by Tendulkar. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India.\nIn the first Test at Lord's, Azharuddin won the toss and asked Gooch\nto bat first. Later in the match,\nGooch had another opportunity to be grateful to Indian generosity\nwhen, on 36, he edged medium-pacer Sanjeev Sharma behind and\nMore floored a straightforward chance.\nFrom the very first day India was fighting to save a Test which\ncould have turned out very differently if not for a startling bit of\nmisjudgement by their captain. Lamb\nraced to 139 at more than a run a ball, his partnership of 308 with\nGooch an all-wicket record for England against India. Mter adding 192 with\nRobin Smith, he was out to a tired stroke, bowled by Prabhakar for\n333. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (1991) called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47.\nThe second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which started on 9\nAugust would finally see the promise of youth translate into a display\nof greatness-a match-saving century from the youngest Test cricketer\nin the world. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on 322\nfor 3, inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. Smith\nweighed in with a ton and England's massive score of519 once again\nmeant that India could only hope to save the Test match. His 179 was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n60\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from 100 balls. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. But not too\nyoung to save his side in battle, overshadowing his teammates, some\nalmost twice his age, who had recklessly thrown away their wickets\non the final day. And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for 225 minutes, faced 189 balls\nand struck 17 boundaries. It made him at 17 years and 112 days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune 1996), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October 1990). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over 30 books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n62\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred. Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored 68 in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make 119 not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing 160. He was only 17 years and 112 daysthe second-youngest Test centurion, after Mushtaq Mohammadand we wondered what he might be capable of doing in the next ten\nyears or so. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. In his second-innings century\nTendulkar escaped a chest-high caught-and-bowled to off-spinner\nEddie Hemmings when he was only 10. But\nyoung Tendulkar stood solid, and so did Prabhakar. He saw India to safety,\nand half-an-hour later, he was stepping forward in the pavilion to\nreceive his Man of the Match award.\" The young prodigy had helped India\nturn the tide in the match, transforming the seemingly inevitable\ndisappointment of millions into jubilation at his wondrous act.\"'\nSaid Richie Benaud on TV after Tendulkar had received his award\nfrom David Lloyd: We'll see a lot more centuries from his bat.' Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his 20s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries. One such must have\nbeen acutely embarrassing to Sachin himself.\nMter all that excitement, the third and final Test at the Oval was\n64\n\nSachin\n\n\falmost anticlimactic. This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country.\n(India's first Test victory in England was at the Oval in 1971. AJI but number ten Hirwani reached double figures\nand there were 50s for Azhar and More as well. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch (80 in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten 157 by David Gower. Tendulkar was third in the averages with 245\nruns at 61. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score 388 in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with 108 not out.\nThe tour of England was a huge step forward in the cricket\neducation ofTendulkar.\n\n66\n\nSachin.", "Class_Cricket_1989": " The\ntour began in June 1988, when the hot summer months in Mumbai\nensured that there was no competitive cricket to speak of.

By close, Mumbai were 95 for the loss ofShishir\nHattangadi's (35) wicket. Alan\nSippy and his captain added 159 runs for the second wicket and the\npair batted serenely almost till the lunch break. But the spectators had\ncome for one thing only-to watch Sachin bat. With the interval\nbarely 15 minutes away, Rajput going for a third run was run out for\n99 at 206 for 2, and Sachin made his way to the crease, heralded by\nrapturous applause.\nSeven deliveries later, Sachin faced his first ball in first-class cricket,\nbowled by off-spinner N isarg Patel. The batsman defended. Sachin's first\nscoring stroke in first-class cricket was a boundary. At lunch Sachin was on ten. Between lunch and\ntea his score progressed to the 80s with a full range of attacking strokes\nas Mumbai strove for quick runs and bonus batting points. Together,\nSachin and Sippy added 145 runs to the score, then the left-bander\ndeparted for 127, bowled by left-arm spinner Joy Zinto, and Mumbai\nwere 361 for 3. Iqbal Khan was bowled for a duck and\nSuru Nayak was run out for two. Sachin was joined by another\ndebutant, Sameer Talpade, by which time he had progressed to 95. Sachin obliged, the shot\nleaving the fielders rooted as he raced to 99. Sachin\n32\n\nSachin\n\n\fwent on the front foot and with a neat turn of the wrists to backward\nsquare leg, he got the vital run. The crowd rose as Sachin returned to\nthe pavilion, unbeaten on 100.\nAt 15 years, 7 months and 17 days, Sachin Tendulkar entered the\nrecord books as the youngest Indian to score a century on first-class\ndebut. The match was drawn as Gujarat scored 306 in their second\ninnings and Mumbai finished on 43 for 2, with Sachin not batting a\nsecond time. Against Bandra Urdu High School, Sachin's 191 runs were\nscored in a mere two hours. Raj put and Sippy were both\nout for a duck in the very first over bowled by left-arm medium-pacer\nRajesh Jadeja. Unlike in his debut match, this time there was the\npressure of a scoreboard reading 0 for 2 when Sachin came to the\ncrease to join opener Hattangadi. He put his head down as the situation\ndemanded, and batted for 156 minutes and 125 balls before getting\nout for 58. None of the other batsmen could\ncross 20. Saurashtra gained the rare honour of taking the first innings\nlead as they scored 297.\nIn the second innings Sachin came in at number three with the\nscore reading 77 and this time played 120 deliveries for his innings\ntop score of89 with seven boundaries, the same as in the first innings.\nHe narrowly missed his second century in three innings when he\nplayed an overambitious shot, slashing at spinner Virbhadran Gohil\nto be well caught by Bimal Jadeja at point.'\nThis match too was drawn, with Mumbai declaring their second\ninnings at 250 for 5 and Saurashtra scoring 78 for 4.\nFollowing his first two matches, a remarkable article on Sachin by\nMumbai journalist Shirish Nadkarni appeared in the Cricketer\nInternational (April 1989).' Mter recountingSachin's scores in the first three innings\nof his fledgling first-class career, Nadkarni wrote: 'If this is the rate at\nwhich Sachin Tendulkar is going to be setting cricketing records, he\nmay even end up putting the great Sunil Gavaskar in the\nshade . [Sachin] is already being talked about as being better than\nGavaskar was at the same age. Mter all, Gavaskar was not called up for\nRanji duty until he was out of his teens, whereas Sachin will only\ncelebrate his sixteenth birthday on 24 April1989. Until this point the\ncomparison runs very much in his favour, but otherwise it is invidious,\nsince Sachin is basically an attacking batsman whereas Sunny was a\nmaster of classical defensive technique.'\nEven after making a mark at the first-class level, Sachin continued\nto play for his school and age-specific tournaments, treating all matches\nwith equal importance. By now, Sanjay Manjrekar, Dilip Vengsarkar\nand Chandrakant Pandit were back from the Test series against New\nZealand and turned out for Mumbai in their third league match\nagainst Baroda in Thane. But there was no dislodging Sachin from\nthe team. Baroda were led by Anshuman Gadcwad with wicketkeeper\nKiran More and left-arm medium-pacer Rashid Patel (all with Test\nexperience) also in the side. This would be Sachin's most formidable\nopposition to date.\nBaroda batted first and scored 313. Mumbai lost openers Rajput\nand Hattangadi with only 20 on the board, and Sachin came in ahead\nofVengsarkar who was nursing an injured right knee. Sachin quickly hit them\nboth for boundaries. But a- lifter from Patel had him caught behind by\nMore for 17, his first failure in first-class cricket. Mumhai gained a\nlead of 19 runs and the match was drawn, with Sachin not batting in\n34\n\nSachin\n\n\fa second innings total of 5 for 1.\nThe Indian under-19 team was to tour Pakistan for the first time and\nSachin was a certainty. He scored 63 in the trial match and also had a\ndouble century and a century in the under-19 Coach Behar Trophy. Sachin\ndid pass his exams but from then on, all further tests would be on the\ncricket field.\nThe last West Zone league match was at Aurangabad in January\n1989 against Maharashtra.\nMaharashtra ran up a huge 575 in their first innings with opener\nSurendra Bhave scoring nearly half the total off his own bat. Tendulkar scored 81 and four not out in\nA Boy Among M-en\n\n35\n\n\fthe drawn match and Maharashtra finished on top of the West Zone\nleague with 55 points. Remarkably, for a 15-year-old in a team full of\ninternational stars, Sachin topped the Mumbai batting in the league\nphase with 349 runs at an average of87. One fascinated viewer of\nSachin's 81 was Sandeep Bamzai who wrote about it in his book\nGavaskar and Tendulkar: Shaping Indian Cricket's Destiny:\nAnkola tried to intimidate the little fella (Sachin), but he took a\nheavy toll of the wayward bowling. As Ankola\nbowled on his legs, Tendulkar smashed him to the mid-wicket\nfence twice, in a trice. Mumbai\ntook on Hyderabad next, led by future India skipper Mohammad\nAzharuddin, in the pre-quarter-finals at Secunderabad in February,\nand by coincidence I was in Hydcrabad to report on the national table\ntennis championships for the Indian Express. But Sachin had already become a major crowdpuller and there must have been close to 10,000 spectators-an\nunusually large crowd for a Ranji Trophy match, even one with so\nmany Test players in both sides. The pitch was a typical turner and the\nspinners played a leading role from the very first session of the first\n36\n\nSachin\n\n\fday Hyderabad had three spinners of note: Venkatapathy Raju (leftarm), Arshad Ayub (off spin) and M.\nSure enough, wickets tumbled to spin as Hyderabad were dismissed\nfor 270 (Shastri 4-90, Mokashi 4-65). But he too fell to Ayub, and Sachin came in at 79 for 4\nat the fag end of the day in the company of captain Vengsarkar.\nSachin defended the first ball he faced and drove the next to the\nboundary.' asked Sachin.\nThe tiny baby-faced Sachin and Vengsarkar, the towering captain\nof the national team, were a study in contrast, at least physically. But\nSachin matched his skipper stroke for stroke as they added 118 runs to\ntake Mumbai out of the woods and eventually to a narrow first innings\nlead. Sachin's 59 came in 145 minutes and contained 7 fours. In the\nsecond innings, he took 15 runs. Mumbai won the match by six\nwickets.\nRavi Shastri was the third Mumbai captain in the season for the\nquarter-final against Uttar Pradesh which was played at home, as\nVengsarkar was unavailable. Mter an opening stand worth 145 between\nR~putand Hattangadi (140), the Mumbai battir::gcollapsed, the next\nnine batsmen failing to reach even double figures. Sachin was\ndismissed for just seven by Test off-spinner Gopal Sharma who had\nthe. Mumbai\npiled up 422 in their second innings (Sharma 7-113). There was\nA Boy Among Men\n\n37\n\n\fanother half-century by Sachin, his 75 taking four minutes short of\nfour hours, his longest stint at the crease so far. Mumbai won by 224\nruns and ran into the formidable Delhi in the semi-finals at the\nWankhede Stadium. Delhi piled\nup 409 in their first innings. Manu Nayyar (105) and Prabhakar (123)\nput on 232 for the opening wicket. Tendulkar got his first chance to\nbowl in first-class cricket (4-0-12-0; 9-2-20-0) and also took his first\ncatch (Manoj Prabhakar for 11 off Nayak's bowling in the second\ninnings). Left-arm spinner Maninder Singh, who had not been\nconsidered for the West Indies tour, had the splendid figures of37-5~\n105-7 when Mumbai batted. But it was Sachin who took the\nhonours and top-scored with 78. It was his seventh score of 50 plus in\nthe season, in 11 innings, and contained a six and five fours. But the rest of the Mumbai batting could not\ncounter Maninder's spin and at the end of the third day, they were\nstruggling at 258 for 7 with Sa chin on 58. Sachin was lastman out and Mumbai\nwere dismissed for 321. The match was drawn, but Delhi were in the\nfinal thanks to their first-innings lead of88 runs. His seven wickets proved to be a\nmatch-winning performance. But it was Sachin's 78 that caught his\neye.\n'The first ball I bowled to him he smashed over extra cover, one\nbounce four.\n'He was so good, so compact at the age of 15 and a half, it was\n]8\n\nSachin\n\n\ftremendous.'\nDespite his outstanding maiden first-class season (583 runs from\n11 innings at 64.77, with one century and six 50s) it had been deCided\nthat Sachin was too raw to be chosen for the Indian team on their tour\nofthe mighty West Indies. Not that Sachin himself thought so.\nSachin: Ifl get selected I will go.\nSachin: I will try my best to face them.\nThirdly, when asked whether he grew tired of batting while\nwith Kambli in that mammoth partnership, Sachin's reply was\nan almost unbelievable shake of the head. And fourthly, Sachin\nmade it very clear that being compared to Gavaskar was a bit\nembarrassing to him, and that he simply wanted to play his\nown, 'natural' game.\nThe 1989-90 season kicked off in Mumbai with the Irani Trophy\nmatch between Ranji Trophy champions Delhi and the Rest oflndia\nA Boy Among Men\n\n39\n\n\ffor whom Sachin was an automatic choice. It was played on 3-7\nNovember 1989 and was a virtual selection trial for the tour to Pakistan\nstarting later that month.\nDelhi piled up 461 and by close on the second day, Rest were 79 for\n3 with Rajput, Surendra Bhave and Manjrekar the batsmen back in\nthe pavilion. When Gursharan\nSingh was out for 31 on the third morning, Sachin joined\nnightwatchman Syed Saba Karim with the total on 119 for 4. Sachin\npunished the medium pace ofSanjeev Sharma and Atul Wassan, but\nwas troubled by Maninder's accurate left-arm spin. Wassan had picked\nup two of the four wickets that had fallen at that stage and was bowling\nwith his tail up. After playing himself in, Sachin on-drove and then\nstraight drove Wassan to the boundary. Captain Madan Lal replaced\nWassan with Sharma who was promptly smashed for four, followed\nby a square cut off Maninder that went racing to the boundary for\nSachin's fourth four. As Sachin\ndefended on the front foot, the ball went off the middle of the bat,\ndropped to the ground and spun on to the stumps to bowl him for a\ncrisply struck 39.\nBut it did give Sachin another crack at the record books.\nIncidentally, during the meeting to select the team for Pakistan,\nthe view was expressed that Sachin might be a failure.\n40\n\nSachin\n\n\fSachin went in with the score at 76 for 2 and as if to celebrate the\nnews ofhis selection, went for the Delhi bowlers. Wassan and Sharma\nwere pretty liberal with the short-pitched stuff, but it didn't seem to\nbother Sachin. By now, it was virtually Sachin v Delhi as wickeb\ntumbled at the other end. Maninder, who had taken four wickets in\nthe first innings including that ofSachin, was hit over mid-wicket for\na huge six. 'It was a brilliant innings.'\nSachin raced to 50 from just 66 balls, with seven fours, and was\nrapidly running out of partners. Maninder once again bowled well to\nclaim three wickets. Sachin tried to\nretain the strike as much as possible. But at 180 for 8,\nVenkatapathy Raju came otlt in the form of the last man as Gursharan\nSingh had fractured a finger on his right hand while batting. Raju was\nout at 209 with Sachin atill 11 runs short of the magic three-figure\nmark. Batting courageously\nwith one hand, Gursharan faced 16 deliveries, finally retiring hurt on\nfive when Sachin cover drove Maninder for his fourteenth boundary\nto go from 99 to 103. The Rest innings was terminated at 245 and\nSachin had registered his second century in eight first-class matches. At 16 years and 197 days, Sachin had added another\n'youngest' record to his collection-the youngest to score a century in\nthe Irani Trophy, that too on debut.", "International_Cricket_1989": " The team would be captained in Tests for\nthe first time by Tamil Nadu opening batsman Krishnamachari\nSrikkanth.\nIndia had been beaten 3-0 in five Tests in the Caribbean and swept\naway 5-0 in the one-day series. Mter the West Indies debacle, the\nIndian captain Dilip Vengsarkar had given a taped interview to Mudar\nPatherya of Sportsworld (May 1989) in which he blamed everyone but\nhimself, despite his woeful batting form. To make things worse, he\nhad gone on to the United States, with several other cricketers, to play\nexhibition matches which had been specifically forbidden by the BCCI.\nThe team was widely described a:; the weakest bowling\n\n\fcombination ever sent to Pakistan. The next day was the\n'\nonly first-class\nfixture before the start of the first Test: a three-day\ngame against the Cricket Board Patron's XI at Rawalpindi where\nSachin made his first appearance in national colours. His performance removed any lingering doubt over his\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n43\n\n\finclusion in the first Test at the National Stadium, Karachi starting\non 15 November 1989. Before him, only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had\nplayed as many matches for India. Unofficially at least, this made Sachin\nthe youngest in history\u00b7 to play Test cricket.'\n_\nSrikkanth won the toss in his first Test as captain and put Pakistan\nin. Shoaib Mohammad had shored up the batting with\n67. Unfortunately, Sachin's first day in Test cricket was marred by a\nspectator running on to the field and attacking the Indian captain after\nfirst menacing Kapil. It was very tough and I thought I was not going to\never play Test cricket again.' (Mid Day, 24 May\n2001)\nAzhar was lbw to Imran, and India were staring the follow-on\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n45\n\n\fsquare in the face at 85 for 6. Shoaib's 95\nand Salim Malik's unbeaten 102 helped Imran declare at 305 for 5\nand set India the highly improbable task of scoring 453 in a minim urn\nof102 overs.3 overs being bowled on the\nopening day and once again the Indian batting was in trouble after a\nuseful opening stand of 68 between Srikkanth and Sidhu.\nThe Indian batting came into its own in the second innings as it\nhad at Karachi a week before.\nSachin scored 41 before being bowled by Qadir. The batsman rose on his toes and the ball was smashed\non the up, past the rooted cover fielder for another boundary. Sidhu went on to 97\nand India were 234 for 7 when the match was called off.'\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n49\n\n\fThe Indian team had emerged with honour intact in the Test series. By now it had come down to 17 for victory in the final over\nbowled by Akram. He is going to take bowlers apart in\ninternational cricket for a very long time.\n'I did say in 1989 that Tendulkar will be a great batsman. I still remember when Wagar Younis bowled him his first\ndelivery when he made his Test debut in Kar<>_chi. He didn't connect the ball and was beaten, but I\ntold myself, \"Here is a kid who will make his name in cricket.\" When I bowled that memorable\nover, I didn't bowl badly, but Tendulkar hit me for three sixes and in all\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n51\n\n\fcollected 27 runs. Tendulkar\nwas also there. By that time he had made his name in the cricketing\nworld. Tendulkar\nis certainly one of those players.'\nIn the first official One-day International at Gujranwala on 18\nDecember, Sachin was out for his first duck in international cricket,\ncaught Akram bowled Younis first ball.\n\n52\n\nSachin\n.", "International_Cricket_1991": " Mohan\nIt was exactly 12 months after he made his international debut that\nSachin Tendulkar finally played a Test match on home soil.\nThat 12 month-period saw the Indian team play an amazing ten\nTest matches, as well as One-day Internationals in Pakistan, New\nZealand, England and Sharjah. Indian fans longing to\nget a glimpse of the teenager who had wowed audiences around the\nworld finally got their opportunity with the one-off Test against Sri\nLanka at Chandigarh in November 1990.\nSri Lanka were still the pushovers of international cricket, a far cry\nfrom their post-1996 status. (From 1994 international cricket in the city moved to the\nsuburb ofMohali on the outskirts ofChandigarh.) The match\nhad been shifted from Jalandhar at short notice due to political unrest\nthere.\nThe under-prepared pitch was the talking point of the Test that\nIndia won by an innings with a day to spare. Azhar won the toss and\nbatted first. It was Azhar's first win as captain and the first for the Indian\nteam after playing 14 Tests abroad.\nSachin managed only 11.\nIndia took the three-match om series against Sri Lanka that followed\nthe one-off Test with a 2-1 margin.\nIndia won the first 001 at Nagpur by 19 runs with Tendulkar\ncontributing 36. The second at Pune on 5 December saw him pick up\nhis first wickets in international cricket, those of openers Roshan\nMahanama and Dhammika Ranatunge, returning figures of9-0-392 with his gentle medium-pacers. But with Pakistan pulling out, the tournament was robbed\nof its glamour and India fought it out with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\nThe lack of international cricket for the rest of the season was a\nblessing in disguise for Indian cricket. Finally, the big names in the\ncountry like Kapil Dcv, Ravi Shastri, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sachin\nTendulkar and others would be available to assist their state and zonal\nteams in the domestic tournaments. The result was some gripping\ncricket after a gap of many years.\nThe quarter-finals against East Zone at Guwahati from 11 to 15\nJanuary 1991 saw Sachin complete a unique treble. With an innings\nof 159 in the first innings he entered the record books as the first and\nstill the only batsman to score a century on debut in the Ranji, Irani\nand Duleep Trophy. Now, after a year in world cricket, he\nhad made it three out of three in domestic cricket's first-class set-up.\nThe East Zone bowling attack was certainly no great shakes and\nhad no big names to speak of Their batting was marked by Sourav\nGanguly's maiden century in his seventh first-class match. Uniquely,\nthere were two future India captains in this match, Ganguly and\nTendulkar, as well as two from the recent past-Ravi Shastri and Dilip\nVengsarkar.\nThe West Zone batting, on the other hand, was formidable, with\nthe first six batsmen in the line-up as well as number eight Kiran\nMore having international experience. Lalchand Rajput (82),\nSanjay Manjrekar (122) and Vengsarkar (72) all cashed in while\nTendulkar top-scored with 159. South had in their ranks\nJavagal Srinath, Venkatapathy Raju, Arshad Ayub, Robin Singh and\nAni) Kumble. Hot words were exchanged between\nbatsman and bowler and for the first time, cricket witnessed a bowler\nassaulting a batsman with a stump on the field of play.\nIn one of those strange twists offate, the Delhi opener, one of the\nmost prolific batsmen in domestic cricket, died eight years later, in\n1998, after being struck on the head while fielding in a club match in\nDhaka.\nA number of Delhi players had been contracted to play league\ncricket in England that summer. Tendulkar\ntop-scored with 82 in Mumbai's total of390. But when Wassan was bowled by\nPatil for 32, Mumbai were assured of a place in the semi-finals on the\nbasis of their first innings lead of one run. Tendulkar's 125 was his third century in five first-class\nmatches.\nHe had bowled just one over in the first innings.\nEven by the batting standards oflndian domestic cricket, Mumbai's\n855 for 6 declared in the semi-finals against Hyderabad at the\nWankhede Stadium four days later was an awesome figure. There were centuries from Vengsarkar and Kambli as\nwell, while Tendulkar's contribution was 70 and 88 in Mumbai's\nsecond innings of 446 for 4 declared. Mumbai, on the other hand, was a virtual who's who oflndian\ncricket and the red-hot favourites. The target was 355 for\nMumbai to win back the Ra~i Trophy they had last claimed in 198485. Sachin took the bowling attack\nspearheaded by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma apart.\nJust two and a half years earlier, the schoolboy Sachin had faced the\nchampion bowler in the nets at the Wankhede Stadium. He was named as the Association of\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n73\n\n\fCricket Statisticians and Scorers oflndia (ACSSI) Cricketer of the Year\nand one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Indian CricketAnnual.\nThe cancellation ofPakistan's visit to India meant there would be no\ninternational cricket till October 1991 when India were scheduled to\nbe back in Sharjah for the three-nation Wills Trophy.\nThe opening match for India in the Sharjah three-nation Wills\nTrophy against Pakistan on 17 October 1991 saw the side record a rare\nwin over their arch-rivals. West Indies were beaten by India in both their league games. India had been\nin the forefront of the movement to ban South Africa from\ninternational cricket in 1970. Until then, South Mrica only played\nTest cricket against the 'white' nations of the ICC. With the release of Nelson\nMandela, the dismantling of apartheid and the advent of multiracial\n74\n\nSachin\n\n\fsports, it was once again India that took the lead at the ICC meeting at\nLord's which saw South Mrica return to the fold. He hurriedly assembled a team under the captaincy of\nveteran Clive Rice and flew to India to play three ODis at the request of\nBCCI secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya.\nThe first match at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on 10 November 1991\nin front of over 90,000 spectators was truly a historic event, going\nbeyond mere sporting cliches.Mohan was effusive in his praise ofTendulkar's many talents\n(he also picked up the wicket of South Mrica's top scorer Wessels) in\nthe Sportstar (23 November 1991): 'It is impossible to fathom what the\nyoungster is capable of. The\nmanner in which he adapted to the slow wicket and played the shots\nfew others could strike with any great conviction is a clear pointer that\nhe is the jewel in the Indian crown.'\nThe Man of the Match award was shared by Donald and Tendulkar,\nan unusual occurrence in international cricket, but one in keeping\nwith the spirit of the occasion.\n\n76\n\nSachin.", "International_Cricket_1996": "World Cup 1996-and England Again\n\nHe plays much the same as I played.-Sir Donald Bradman\nThe World Cup returned to Asia in 1996, a decade after the Reliance\nWorld Cup, and as in 1987, under stormy circumstances. India,\nPakistan and Sri Lanka won the right to co-host the sixth edition in\nthe face of fierce opposition from England. Then, on the eve of\ncricket's mega event, terrorist bombs struck in the heart of Colombo,\nand Australia and West Indies refused to play their Group A matches\nin Sri Lanka due to security concerns.ificent tournament, nonetheless, won in grand style by the Sri\nLankans who defeated Australia in the final at Lahore. Their batting challenge\nwas now firmly in the hands ofSachin Tendulkar who had matured\nfrom 'promising' prior to the 1992 World Cup, to one of the best\nbatsmen in the world four years later.'\nThat innings came in India's opening World Cup tie against Kenya\nat Cuttack; he was 127 not out, at nearly a run a ball. India, needing\n200 to win, coasted to victory with seven wickets to spare after\nTendulkar's opening stand of 163 with Ajay Jadeja.\nIndia's first big test would come three days later, at Gwalior,\nwhere they met the West Indies, champions in 1975 and 1979 but by\nnow in rapid decline. The scores:\nLara-2; Tendulkar-70. Chasing Windies'\n173, India lost two early wickets and it could so easily have been three:\nTendulkar was dropped at square leg when on 12, and then on 22 in\nthe tenth over. By then, India wen: comfortably\nplaced at 125 for 4 and the Man of the Match award was Sachin's\nagain.\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n139\n\n\fIt was two weeks before the World Cup came up with its first classic\nmatch. The India-Australia World Cup encounters had gone down to\nthe wire both in 1987 at Chennai and in 1992 at Brisbane. But the\ncricket played by both sides was out of the top draw. Waugh's 126\nfollowed on from his 130 against Kenya four days earlier, making him\nthe first batsman to make back-to-back centuries in the World Cup. But Kambli's 106 gave the home side victory by 40\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n141\n\n\fruns and this set up an electric encounter with Pakistan in the quarterfinals.\nIf any sporting event epitomized George Orwell's description of\nsport as 'war minus the shooting', the India-Pakistan match was it. It was a lucky break for India. All the top order batsmen got a good\nstart with Sidhu holding the innings together with 93. His 45 from 26 balls helped India to a huge 287\nfor8. Prasad picked\nup two more wickets, Ani.1 overs, in reply to Sri Lanka's 251 for 8, there\ncould have been only one winner. India lost Sidhu early in\nfront of a crowd of 110,000-the biggest ever for a cricket match.\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n143\n\n\fThe Indian batting after that defied all reason. Seven wickets went\ndown for 22 runs as one a'fter the other, the batsmen committed harakiri.17 from his seven matches-still the only instance in the\nWorld Cup of a batsman exceeding 500 runs.\nJust a fortnight after the World Cup finals, India, Pakistan and Sri\nLanka were at it again. The hectic schedule of international cricket\nhad brought the three teams together in Singapore, where big-time\ninternational cricket was being played for the first time. Tendulkar's round 100 was his first century\nagainst Pakistan in either form of the game. This time it was\nIndia's turn to pip Pakistan on net run rate and reach the final against\nSouth Mrica, who made it a debut to remember by winning the match\nby 38 runs. There was, however, the considerable consolation for India\n144\n\nSachin\n\n\fof beating Pakistan in the return match by 28 runs, having lost the\nopening game by 38 runs.\nThe match saw India record its highest total to date (305 for 5)\nwhile the stand for the second wicket (231) between Tendulkar and\nSidhu was India's best for all wickets. It appeared to be only\na matter of time-and not much at that-before he would be replaced\nin Indian cricket's hot seat by the man who could seemingly do no\nV.\nTendulkar had made his first Test century at Old Trafford on the 1990\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n145\n\n\ftour of England. Now India returned for three Tests and three ODis. Though Nasser Hussain took the Man of the Match\naward for his maiden Test century, it was Tendulkar who stood out\nwith his 122 out of an Indian second-innings total of219. 'The real\nMan of the Match,' as Wisden Cricket Monthly aptly put it.\nIt was a flawless innings with strokes all around the wicket.

Tendulkar played in the opening match against\nNew Zealand at Carisbrook but once again failed to score.\nHe was dropped for the next match against Australia but in the one\nafter that, against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on 6 March, he\nscored an attractive 36 from 39 balls, with five fours, as India won by\none run. Tendulkar was once again dropped for the\nmatch and Australia won by eight wickets to complete an unsuccessful\ntour for the Indians. It was a disappointing tournament for both\nSachin and the team as India lost both its league matches, to Sri Lanka\nand Pakistd. Sachin\nscored 10 (run out) and 20 in the two games.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of 1990. India were to play three Tests and two\nOne-day Internationals apart from two months of first-class and oneday games against the counties. After scoring 19 in the opening cneday match against League Cricket Conference at Sunderland,\nTendulkar was rested for the first county game versus Yorkshire at\nHeadingley. Against Hampshire he had scores of32 and 58 not out as\nthe Indians lost by seven wickets. 'It\nwas quite simply an astonishing innings.\n\n\fSachin's knocks of 92 and 70 against Kent at Canterbury were\nsignificant as they were the first for him in the role of opener. According\nto manager and former Test stumper Madhav Mantri, Sachin had\nvolunteered for the slot, keeping the team's interests in mind. The\nIndians won the game by seven wickets. Kumble struck t\\vo telling blows at this stage and India were\nback in the game. Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. h the end, England's\ntotal of229 all out (in the last of the 55 overs) was a credit to the Indian\nbowlers' persistence.

Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India.\nIn the first Test at Lord's, Azharuddin won the toss and asked Gooch\nto bat first.\nFrom the very first day India was fighting to save a Test which\ncould have turned out very differently if not for a startling bit of\nmisjudgement by their captain. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47. In 32 overs in Gloucestershire's\nfirst innings, he picked up the wickets of Hodgson, Romaines and\nAlleyne, three top order batsmen, for 79 runs.\nThe second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which started on 9\nAugust would finally see the promise of youth translate into a display\nof greatness-a match-saving century from the youngest Test cricketer\nin the world. Smith\nweighed in with a ton and England's massive score of519 once again\nmeant that India could only hope to save the Test match. His 179 was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n60\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His 189-run stand with Manjrekar (93) took the score\nto 246 for 4 and was followed by another worth 112 for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. It took Sachin 54 minutes\nand 38 balls to get his first run. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests.\nGooch failed for the first time in the series in the second innings,\nbut England's 320 for 4 left India with a huge task ahead of them. To\nwin, they needed 408 runs from a minimum of 88 overs. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from 100 balls. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for 225 minutes, faced 189 balls\nand struck 17 boundaries. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune 1996), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October 1990). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over 30 books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n62\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred.

This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country.\n(India's first Test victory in England was at the Oval in 1971.) Never\nbefore had India scored over 600 against England and for the first time\nat home England were forced to follow-on against India. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch (80 in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten 157 by David Gower. Gooch garnered over 1000\nTest runs over the summer, including three Tests earlier in the season\nagainst New Zealand. It was a summer full of tons and\nruns and yet it was Tendulkar's match-saving knock at Old Trafford\nthat continued to be the talking point of the year. The match\nwas billed as Michael Parkinson's World XI v Indians and ended in a\ndraw. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score 388 in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with 108 not out.\nThe tour of England was a huge step forward in the cricket\neducation ofTendulkar.\n\n66\n\nSachin.", "Test_Cricket_1991": " Mohan\nIt was exactly 12 months after he made his international debut that\nSachin Tendulkar finally played a Test match on home soil.\nThat 12 month-period saw the Indian team play an amazing ten\nTest matches, as well as One-day Internationals in Pakistan, New\nZealand, England and Sharjah. Mter all that hectic activity, the Indians\nwould play just one Test in the next 12 months. Indian fans longing to\nget a glimpse of the teenager who had wowed audiences around the\nworld finally got their opportunity with the one-off Test against Sri\nLanka at Chandigarh in November 1990. The prosaic sounding Sector 16 Stadium\nin Chandigarh was hosting its first Test match, which would also be\nits last.

It was Azhar's first win as captain and the first for the Indian\nteam after playing 14 Tests abroad.\nSachin managed only 11.\nSri Lanka's plea for an extra Test match was turned down by the\nBCCI, citing short notice. With Pakistan subsequently cancelling their\nvisit to India on security grounds, this remained the lone Test of the\n1990-91 season.\nIndia took the three-match om series against Sri Lanka that followed\nthe one-off Test with a 2-1 margin.\nIndia won the first 001 at Nagpur by 19 runs with Tendulkar\ncontributing 36. The second at Pune on 5 December saw him pick up\nhis first wickets in international cricket, those of openers Roshan\nMahanama and Dhammika Ranatunge, returning figures of9-0-392 with his gentle medium-pacers. To add to his wickets, Tendulkar\nrecorded his first ODI50 (53) which saw India win comfortably by six\nwickets. He reached his half-century in just 38 balls and hit seven\nfours and a six in a sparkling innings.\nThe final game at Margao was played on an under-prepared pitch\nand halfway through the innings, Azhar and Tendulkar had to call for\nhelmets to play the Sri Lankan spinners as the ball turned and jumped\nalarmingly. Tendulkar's 30 was the top score in a miserable Indian\n68\n\nSachin\n\n\ftotal of 136 all out.\nTendulkar had a quiet tournament, though he equalled his highest\nscore of 53 in the final at Kolkata, in which India beat Sri Lanka by\nseven wickets.\nThe lack of international cricket for the rest of the season was a\nblessing in disguise for Indian cricket. The result was some gripping\ncricket after a gap of many years.\nThe quarter-finals against East Zone at Guwahati from 11 to 15\nJanuary 1991 saw Sachin complete a unique treble. With an innings\nof 159 in the first innings he entered the record books as the first and\nstill the only batsman to score a century on debut in the Ranji, Irani\nand Duleep Trophy. Now, after a year in world cricket, he\nhad made it three out of three in domestic cricket's first-class set-up.\nThe East Zone bowling attack was certainly no great shakes and\nhad no big names to speak of Their batting was marked by Sourav\nGanguly's maiden century in his seventh first-class match. Uniquely,\nthere were two future India captains in this match, Ganguly and\nTendulkar, as well as two from the recent past-Ravi Shastri and Dilip\nVengsarkar. Lalchand Rajput (82),\nSanjay Manjrekar (122) and Vengsarkar (72) all cashed in while\nTendulkar top-scored with 159. South had in their ranks\nJavagal Srinath, Venkatapathy Raju, Arshad Ayub, Robin Singh and\nAni) Kumble. Patel\ndecided to give the North batsmen a taste of their own medicine in the\nshort time left for them to bat out the match, and bowled some\n70\n\nSachin\n\n\fmenacing bouncers and beamers. Hot words were exchanged between\nbatsman and bowler and for the first time, cricket witnessed a bowler\nassaulting a batsman with a stump on the field of play.\nIn one of those strange twists offate, the Delhi opener, one of the\nmost prolific batsmen in domestic cricket, died eight years later, in\n1998, after being struck on the head while fielding in a club match in\nDhaka.\nA number of Delhi players had been contracted to play league\ncricket in England that summer. Conflicting interests led to a fixed\nmatch, as the Delhi players admitted to the Central Bureau of\nInvestigation (CBI) a decade later, during its investigations into matchfixing and corruption in cricket. Tendulkar\ntop-scored with 82 in Mumbai's total of390. But when Wassan was bowled by\nPatil for 32, Mumbai were assured of a place in the semi-finals on the\nbasis of their first innings lead of one run. Tendulkar's 125 was his third century in five first-class\nmatches.\nHe had bowled just one over in the first innings. Now, in the\nsecond, he got one to leap from the placid pitch and hit Bantoo Singh,\nfracturing the nose of the first-innings century-maker.\nEven by the batting standards oflndian domestic cricket, Mumbai's\n855 for 6 declared in the semi-finals against Hyderabad at the\nWankhede Stadium four days later was an awesome figure. Mumbai, on the other hand, was a virtual who's who oflndian\ncricket and the red-hot favourites. The target was 355 for\nMumbai to win back the Ra~i Trophy they had last claimed in 198485. Sachin took the bowling attack\nspearheaded by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma apart. The Haryana bowling was dispatched all around\nas Tendulkar raced towards a century which appeared inevitable till\nhe was caught by Jadeja off the bowling of off-spinner Yogendra\nBhandari for 96. The last 46 runs had come from just 26 balls and the\nsparkling innings was studded with five sixes and nine fours.\nJust two and a half years earlier, the schoolboy Sachin had faced the\nchampion bowler in the nets at the Wankhede Stadium. When the ninth wicket fell, debutant pace bowler\nAbey Kuruvilla joined the captain with 50 runs still needed for victory. Though Vengsarkar's 139\nnot out was the top score for Mumbai, the run chase would have been\ngiven up as futile if it hadn't been for the teenager's batting\npyrotechnics. He was named as the Association of\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n73\n\n\fCricket Statisticians and Scorers oflndia (ACSSI) Cricketer of the Year\nand one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Indian CricketAnnual.\nThe cancellation ofPakistan's visit to India meant there would be no\ninternational cricket till October 1991 when India were scheduled to\nbe back in Sharjah for the three-nation Wills Trophy.\nThe opening match for India in the Sharjah three-nation Wills\nTrophy against Pakistan on 17 October 1991 saw the side record a rare\nwin over their arch-rivals.\nIn the final league match, which India lost to Pakistan under dark\nskies and in controversial circumstances, Tendulkar fell one short of\nanother 50. West Indies were beaten by India in both their league games. In\nthe second of these, Sachin got the Man of the Match award, but not\nfor his batting. Until then, South Mrica only played\nTest cricket against the 'white' nations of the ICC. He hurriedly assembled a team under the captaincy of\nveteran Clive Rice and flew to India to play three ODis at the request of\nBCCI secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya. His 55 at Kolkata would be followed a year later by a century\non Test debut against the same opponents at Durban. Ifhe continues to bat\nlike this he will be the leader of the new era in which the raw power of\nbatting is going to dominate cricket as it has baseball.'\nThe Man of the Match award was shared by Donald and Tendulkar,\nan unusual occurrence in international cricket, but one in keeping\nwith the spirit of the occasion.\n\n76\n\nSachin.", "Test_Cricket_1992": "World Cup Debut\n\nInzamam is a much better batsman against fast bowling.-Imran Khan\nThere was some speculation at the end of the Test series that the Indian\nteam would return for a short break before their opening World Cup\ngame at Perth against England on 22 February, just 17 days after the\nfifth Test at the same venue had ended.\nNew Zealand, which had failed to make the semi-finals in 1987,\nstunned World Cup holders Australia by 37 runs in Auckland, with\n\n\fKiwi skipper Martin Crowe stroking a masterly 100 not out-and\nsurprising one and all by opening the bowling with off-spinner Dipak\nPatel. On the same day at the Western Association Cricket Association\n(wAcA), India came within a whisker of upsetting the 1987 runnersup England, ultimately losing by just nine runs. This was a match\nthat swung back and forth as India became the first team to bat under\nlights in a World Cup game. Smith was out at 197 for 4 and the last six wickets\nthen crashed for just 27 runs. The English tally for the last seven overs\nwas 39 runs for the loss of six wickets and a total of236 for 9 appeared\neminently achievable. At 63 for 2, it was left to the Mumbai pair of\nShastri and Tendulkar to put the innings back on the rails.\nIndia's next match against Sri Lanka at Mackay was abandoned\ndue to rain after just two balls had been bowled and both teams were\nawarded one point. Australia had suffered another shock defeat,\n88\n\nSachin\n\n\ffollowing their loss to New Zealand m the opening game.\nThe India-Australia bout at Brisbane on 1 March was thm. It turned out to be\none of the greatest games of cricket ever, at the venue of the first ever\ntied Test (in 1960).\nAustralia batted first. India, in its innings, had reached 45 for 1 (Srikkanth\nthe batsman out, bowled for a duck by McDermott) after 16. While only two runs had\nbeen knocked off the target, India would have three overs less to play. Azhar played typically glorious,\nwristy shots all round the ground and raced to 93 from 103 balls (ten\nfours) before becoming the first offour run-out victims in the innings:\nBorder's rocket-like throw caught him short of the crease. With eight overs and six wickets in hand, the target had come down\nto 77. Tendulkar's failure (he was out for 11)\nput further pressure on the lower order. But he was bowled next ball, trying to finish the game with\nanother four. Srinath swung hard and connected cleanly, sending the ball\nsoaring down to the fine leg boundary for what appeared to be a certain\nsix and victory. At full tilt, Steve Waugh ran\nround and reached for the catch, only to drop it even as the crowd\ngasped in dis belie\u00a3 Waugh grabbed the ball as it slid towards the gutter\nwhile Srinath and Raju ran for their lives, and threw as the batsmen\nwere crossing for the third run that would have tied the game.\nThe two teams met at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 4 March\n1992. The Indian total of216\nfor 7 was built around Ajay Jadeja's 46 (he opened in place of Shastri)\nand Tendulkar's 54 not out from 62 balls.\nInzamam-ul-Haq and Zahid Fazal both fell for two and at 17 for 2, the\nIndian bowlers had gained the upper hand. It\nwas Tendulkar who made the breakthrough, getting Sohail caught\nlow down at midwicket by Srikkanth for 62. Once Miandad had been\nbowled by Srinath for a painstaking 40, the rest of the batting fell apart\nand subsided to 173 all out, leaving India winners by 43 runs and\nTendulkar with his first Man of the Match award in the World Cup. The match was initially\ncurtailed to 32 overs. Zimbabwe's innings was terminated by another\ndownpour, at 104 for 1 in 19. Though India's score at the same\nstage was 106 for 3, their 'best' 19 overs had produced 159, hence the\nstrange calculations and victory to India by 55 runs. He smashed his highest ODI score of81 from 77 balls, with eight\nfours and a six, that saw them to 203 for 7.\nTendulkar failed against the West Indies at Wellington, caught\nbehind off a perfect leg-cutter from Curtly Ambrose as India went\ndown by five wickets. His stand of127 in 30 overs with Azhar produced some dazzling\nbatting in front ofa crowd of exactly 9000.\nThe 22-year-old hit 42 in the final against England, following which\nhis captain predicted he would be the world's number one batsman in\nthe near future.\nTen years later, this is lmran Khan's analysis of the two batsmen\nfrom the subcontinent who promised to rule the world:\nI feel both Tendulkar and Inzamam are great players.

Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Azharuddin played briefly for\nNorthamptonshire, Glamorgan and Derbyshire respectively, while\nin more rect:nt years Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid\nand Sourav Ganguly have turned out for various teams with mixed\nresults. It wasn't surprising,\ntherefore, that he should receive an offer to play county cricket.\nCricket is part of the Yorkshire ethos, much as it is in Mumbai, or in\nVictoria and New South Wales in Australia.\nWhile other teams were marching ahead with their overseas stars,\nYorkshire cricket went from bad to worse. Yorkshire ChiefExecutive\nChris Hassell flew to Mumbai in April 1992 for the signing, which\nTendulkar agreed to after receiving the stamp of approval from coach\nRamakant Achrekar and mentor Sunil Gavaskar. For his part, Tendulkar fitted\nin remarkably well, considering he was just 19 and aware that there\nwas a fair amount of opposition to the century-old 'no outsiders'\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n95\n\n\ftradition being dismantled in his favour. There\nwas just one century (exactly 100 vDurham) and seven 50s in a total\nof 1070 championship runs from 25 innings at 46. In the Sunday League (40 overs), his\nbest was 107 from 73 balls against Lancashire. Teammate Phil Carrick was quoted on that innings by Scyld\nBerry in Wisden Cricket Monthly Oune 1996):\nI walked over to have a chat with him as he came in and I\nremember him staring at me quite intently-perhaps he\ncouldn't understand me.\nAgainst Essex he struck a classy 93 as Yorkshire won by a huge\nmargin of an innings and 55 runs. In addition, he struck 86 against Hampshire and a brilliant\n96\n\nSachin\n\n\f92 against Gloucestershire. As if he were\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n97\n\n\fstill on trial. He was interviewed by Andrew Collomose for the Cricketer\nInternational (November 1992), at Scarborough, during his last game\nagainst Nottinghamshire. But the cricket itself was very hard fought, at\ntimes even bitter, with the home side determined to give their fans a\ntaste of victory after more than two decades. The Indian team had\nearlier made a brief stopover in Harare en route to South Mrica, where\nZimbabwe gave a pretty good account of themselves in their maiden\n98\n\nSachin\n\n\fTest. The Test marked the second occasion on which Tendulkarwas\nout for a duck, caught and bowled by master off-spinner John Traicos.\nThe one-day festival match at Raadjasfontein that kicked off the\nSouth Mrican tour saw Tendulkar score a century against Nicky\nOppenheimer's XI. But there were quite a few interesting events that captured\nthe attention of cricket historians. South Mrican captain Kepler Wessels, who had\nearlier represented his adopted country, Australia, in Test cricket,\nbecame the first to score a century for two different countries. Ramakant\nAchrekar's 'boy' Praveen Amre became the ninth Indian to score a\ncentury on Test debut.\nThe most dramatic moment of the match came on 14 November\n1992, the second day of the Test. Tendulkar was on 11 and the total on\n38 for 2. It appeared desperately close and\nSouth Mrican Cyril Mitchley at square leg passed the decision to the\numpires' room, outlining the shape of a TV screen with his hands.\nThird umpire Karl Liebenberg was sitting in front of the TV, and 29\nseconds later came his response: a green light flashed (for 'go' rather\nthan red for 'stay'-the reverse works now) and Tendulkar made his\nway back, the first cricketer to go through a trial by TV. Cricket\nhad entered the technological age, at last.\nThe fact that this new technology did not find universal acceptance\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n99\n\n\feven among the umpires may well have cost India the second Test at\nJohannesburg. It was a mistake no international umpire\nwould make again.\nIndia too lost early wickets. It was Tendulkar's\nnineteenth Test and twenty-eighth innings. In an\nIndian total of227, Tendulkar scored virtually half the runs off his\nown bat. Once again,\nthe luminaries of cricket were ecstatic in their reaction to Tendulkar's\nbatting. Under incredible pressure, he batted\nsuperbly.\nBetween the second and third Tests, India and South Africa played\na series of seven One-day Internationals. Tendulkar was a major\ndisappointment, with only 144 runs from seven innings, and a highest\nscore of32. India were beaten 5-2.\nDonald came into his own in the third Test at Port Elizabeth and\nIndia were crushed by nine wickets. There was an extraordinary\ncentury by Kapil Devin the second innings. Perhaps the most shocking\nwas umpire Rudi Koertzen's decision to give Tendulkar caught behind\nfirst ball off Donald in the second innings, when the ball had brushed\nhis pad. The departing batsman was horrified and non-striker Shastri\ndropped his bat in disgust and had words with the umpire.\nMuch of the cricket played in the three Tests had been dreary. But\nthe fourth and final match at Cape Town made a dubious entry into\ncricket's record books as the slowest of all time. Tendulkar was his side's. top scorer in the match with 73. For Kepler Wessels and his countrymen, the series\nmarked a triumphant return to Test cricket.\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n101.", "Test_Cricket_1993": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nEngland's tour to India under the captaincy of Graham Gooch saw\nMohammed Azharuddin placed on probation, in a manner of\nspeaking. His appointment was confirmed only till the first Test in\nKolkata in january 1993. The\ntrend was set in the first 001 atjaipur, which England won by four\nwickets after a scrambled single from the last ball of the match. It was\nKambli's twentieth birthday and he celebrated it in style with his first\ncentury in international cricket. His score of100 not out came from\n149 balls and there was some adverse comment at the end of the game\nover the manner in which he crawled through the 90s.\nThey batted till the end of the innings with Kambli reaching his\ncentury in the last over.\nBoth batsmen failed in the second om at Chandigarh, though India\nwon by five wickets to draw level. It was here, against England at the Eden Gardens,\nthat Azhar ~ad first dazzled the cricket world with his century on\ndebut in the 1984-85 series, followed by two more on the trot. The captain's dazzling 182 crushed\nEngland's spirits and victory was India's by nine wickets. With just a handful of runs\nneeded for the win after England had followed on, Sachin and Vi nod\nwere at the crease when India wrapped things up before lunch on the\nfifth day. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. In 1998, an outstanding innings against Australia saw Sachin\nmaster Shane Warne at Chepauk. But there was heartbreak in 1999:\nanother masterly ton took India to the doorstep of victory against\nPakistan before Sachin's back gave way and India fell just short. Three\nyears later, in March 2001, Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series 2-1.\nSuccess at Home and Abroad\n\n10]\n\n\fThere was drama even before the start of the second Test in Chennai\nin 1993. The\ndemoralized Englishmen were forced to follow-on for the second time\nin successive Tests and lost by an innings. This, after their bowlers\nhad conceded the highest total against India at home. Though he\nbowled just two overs in each innings, he surprised the cognoscenti\nby bowling genuine leg breaks.\nIndia had won the series. And the third and final Test in Mumbai\nproved to be the final nail in the coffin for the English team. A new\nrecord total by India at home, and another innings victory. The Test was a\ntriumph for the Mumbai trio of Kambli, Tendulkar and Amre,\nparticularly the left-hander. In only his third Test match, Kambli had\ncompiled the highest score by an Indian batsman against England:\n224. The third wicket stand with Tendulkar was worth 194\nruns in 44 overs, with the senior partner somewhat subdued. His 78\ntook nearly four and a half hours and was not nearly as flawless as his\nbatting in the previous Test.\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests: 236 not out by Sunil Gavaskar.\nBefore the series began, the selectors had named Tendulkar captain\nof the under-25 side which played against England at Cuttack prior to\nthe first Test. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India. Also in the team were W V Raman,\nSanjay Manrejkar and Salil Ankola, all with Test experience. But before that,\nthere was a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in New Delhi and once\nagain this was a triumph for Kambli-and how. He suddenly saw his\nname up alongside those ofWally Hammond and Don Bradman as\nthe only other batsman to score two consecutive Test double centuries.\nIt was heady stuf( He was the first Indian left-hander to score more\nthan one Test century and that too, in only his fourth Test. India completed another innings victory\nagainst the hapless Zimbabweans for their fifth win in a row at home.\nThat spectacular run would continue in Sri Lanka where India won a\nTest and a series abroad for the first time since England in 1986 (an\nachievement they have not been able to equal, till the end of2001).\nThe first Test against Sri Lanka, at Kandy, was a washout with only\n106\n\nSachin\n\n\f12 overs bowled. India won the second Test at Colombo's sse by 235\nruns as Tendulkar and Kambli both recorded centuries, though not in\nthe same innings.\nTendulkar too had got a dicey decision in the first innings when he\nwas adjudged caught at short leg for 28, when it was doubtful whether\nhe had played the ball.\nKambli's third hundred saw India score 366 in their first innings.\nAnil Kumble picked up five wickets as the home side trailed by 112.\nTendulkar was determined to make amends in the second innings as\nthe Indians went for quick runs and a declaration. Sidhu recorded an\nidentical score, while Prabhakar struck 95.50, though\nit was Kambli who had the best aggregate\nWith Azhar off the field with flu, the vice captain got his chance to\nlead the side on the final day of the third Test.' Sachin became the\nyoungest to lead a side in Test cricket-albeit in an acting capacity.

India\ncrumbled to 100 and 66---the lowest ever score against South Mrica\nin Test cricket.'\nAs has often happened in Tendulkar's career, the rival bowlers and\nfielders reserved their best for when he was at the crease. In the first\ninnings he was bowled by a beauty from Donald for 15. Donald felt the ball that got Sachin got was\none of the most lethal he had ever bowled in a Test match. Following\ntwo half-volleys which were driven regally to the boundary, Tendulkar\ngot one that pitched on a perfect length just cutside off stump. It\njagged back at such speed that the batsman was still in the process of\nbringing down his bat when the stump was sent cartwheeling in the\ndirection of the stunned wicketkeeper.\nIndia were crushed again in the second Test at Cape Town, this\ntime by 282 runs as the home side scaled the series 2-0.\nThe batsmen were Tcndulkar and Azhar, the stand was worth 222,\nthe runs came in 40 uvers and produced 175 minutes of some of the\nmost exhilarating batting seen in the history ofTest cricket. He had batted for just under three hours and raced to 115 off\n109 balls with 19 fours and a six.\nThe man with the best view was South African wicketkceper Dave\nRichardson and this is what he told me about Tendulkar's innings: 'I\ncan say it was the only occasion when I have honestly enjoyed an\nopposing player scoring a century. Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February 1997):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of 1997 the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n157\n\n\fsublime . Azharuddin played what\nyou might call an ex-captain's innings . He was determined\nto go out there and indulge in the carefree pleasure of showing\neveryone how to hit a cricket ball.\nZimbabwe reached 240 for 8 in their 50 overs and the Indian target\nwas 241-from 40. That they got home by six wickets in 39. Dravid had opened with Ganguly in the\nprevious matches, but now Tendulkar was back at the top of the order\nto give the run chase the launching pad it needed. Rain intervened again\n158\n\nSachin\n\n\fand India's target was altered to a stiffer 251 from 40 overs. Tendulkar\nset the tone with a lightning 45 from 33 balls and his stand of 66 with\nDravid came at eight an over. There were already\nrumblings that the captain was unhappy with the team that he had\nbeen presented with for the five Tests and four oms for India's first\nvisit to the Caribbean since losing 3-0 in 1989. Indeed, 1997 would probably be the most hectic\never, with tours to South Mrica, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,\nToronto and Sharjah for Test and 001 tournaments, as well as home\ngames.st Indies.\n\n160\n\nSachin\n\n\fPoor David would sit out the whole Test series and get his chance\nonly in the oms that followed.\nIndia, with their limited bowling attack, did well to draw the first\nTest at Kingston. Tendulkar pointed out that this was\nthe first time an Indian touring side had escaped defeat in the opening\nTest of a series abroad since he made his debut in Pakistan in 1989. He was at his best in\nthe first innings when he cracked a delightful 83 and followed it up\nwith 78. Tendulkar had scores of7 and 15 not out. Only twice before had India won Test matches in the\nCaribbean and both were played in the Trinidad capital.\nPlaying in his fiftieth Test match, Tendulkar ground out one of his\nslowest batting displays after the West Indians had been dismissed for\n296 in their first innings.\nThereafter, it was safety-first tactics with Navjot Singh Sidhu-back\nfor the series after serving his sentence following the episode in\nEngland-recording the second slowest double century in Test cricket.\nDravid and Sidhu did the initial rescue act in their second wicket\nstand of171. But at no time did the batsmen seek to\nDefeat and Despair\n\n161\n\n\faccelerate the scoring. This\nsealed not only the Test, but effectively the series as well for the West\nIndies. The pitch was sub-standard, the ball seamed all over the place\nand the uneven bounce caused all sorts of problems for the batsmen. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for 298. For the second time in a row, the Indians gained the first innings\nlead, even if it was only 21 runs.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of 170 runs.\nThe Indian seamers were back in action in the second innings to\n162\n\nSachin\n\n\frout West Indies for 140, their lowest score against India at home. Lara\ncounter-attacked to top score with 45 and then a last wicket stand\nworth 33 between Ambrose and Dillon pushed the target for India to\n120. Tendulkar\nwas done in by the bowler, rather than the pitch. Wtsden Cricket Monthly (May 1997) compared the\nperformances of the two 'superstar captains'. 'I think it\nwas a combination of good bowling by the West Indies, bad batting by\nus nd a terrible track,' he said when asked 'What really went wrong at\nBarbados.'\n'It was very tough batting in the fourth innings. It was mainly the\nbatting which let us down. Since I became captain, it is only in South\nMrica that I have played on wickets where the ball was coming\non and once in Barbados . I just can't go and slam the ball because runs in\ninternational cricket are not easy to come by. The four ODis that followed the Test series had more\nthan their fair share of controversy.

It came down to 65 off\n68 balls with eight wickets in hand. Unbelievably, those wickets fell in\na heap for India to be all out for 231. Mter the good start, the batsmen\nsimply lashed out at the bowling when the target was well within\nreach.\nWest Indies returned the compliment from the second match by\ncrushing India by ten wickets in the final game, at the venue of their\nsensational Test triumph five weeks earlier.", "Test_Cricket_1998": " Now\nTendulkar was determined to prove a point to the spectators who had\ninsulted him and his team in December 1997.

While India won 49.71 of the 342 ODis he played in (till\nthe end of2004), in his absence the winning percentage dropped to\n42. In Test matches, India also lost three, drew one and won one of\nthe five Tests during this same period.

'It\nwas quite simply an astonishing innings. The\nIndians won the game by seven wickets. Kumble struck t\\vo telling blows at this stage and India were\nback in the game. Just 19 years of age, Kumble then bowled Gower\nand had Robin Smith caught behind for six. h the end, England's\ntotal of229 all out (in the last of the 55 overs) was a credit to the Indian\nbowlers' persistence. Though\nTendulkar scored only 19, his straight six off spinner Eddie Hemmings\nwas a massive one, clearing almost 100 yards.\nAnother full house for the second game at Trent Bridge, another\ntoss won by the Indian captain and another victory with exactly t\\'Vo\novers to spare, this time by five wickets. Gooch was bowled cheaply.\nBut Robin Smith's 103 and 50s from Atherton and wicketkeeper Jack\nRussell helped England to a formidable 281 all out in exactly 55 overs.\nManjrekar followed up his 82 in the first game with 59 and Vengsarkar\nhit a rapid 54 with t\\'Vo sixes as all the batsmen scored usefully. India\nHail the Boy King\n\n57\n\n\fneeded 145 runs from the last 20 overs to win and got them in some\nstyle, thanks in part to a delightful little innings of 31 from 26 balls\n(two fours) by Tendulkar. Azhar smashed 63 not out from 44 balls and took the Man of\nthe Series award for India. But the 37-year-old was beginning to feel the\nfatigue of an innings of more than ten hours. India used five bowlers during England's\n58\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away 99-conceded more\nthan 100 runs. Tendulkar came in to bat, his first visit to\nLord's, and had to return disappointed, bowled middle stump for ten\nbetween bat and pad by Chris Lewis.\nOnce Azhar was bowled by Eddie Hemmings for 121, it was left to\nKapil to make England bat again. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. The Indians, the second time round, could not\nrepeat their first-innings heroics and crumbled to 224 all out to lose\nby 247 runs. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of27\nin which he struck four boundaries. Lamb,\nbatting in the second innings, had clouted Hirwani, but slightly\nmiscued the drive.Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September 1990) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines. Tendulkar's scores were 13 and 47. In 32 overs in Gloucestershire's\nfirst innings, he picked up the wickets of Hodgson, Romaines and\nAlleyne, three top order batsmen, for 79 runs. This was after left-arm\nspinner Raju had ended his tour with a broken hand while batting in\nthe first innings. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on 322\nfor 3, inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. But with the last five\nwickets going down for 74, his innings of 68 (eight fours) in 216\nminutes was enough to see England's lead cut to a manageable 87\nruns.\nGooch failed for the first time in the series in the second innings,\nbut England's 320 for 4 left India with a huge task ahead of them. To\nwin, they needed 408 runs from a minimum of 88 overs. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from 100 balls.\nAt the start of the last 20 overs, the score was 255 for 6 and the field\nwas still an attacking one. Sachin's maiden century had taken 171 balls, 14 of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary. And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for 225 minutes, faced 189 balls\nand struck 17 boundaries. It made him at 17 years and 112 days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at 109 for 4, with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October 1990) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'. Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored 68 in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make 119 not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing 160. His first innings in this match was worth 68, and he had had to\nstruggle for almost an hour for his first run. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. Most notable innings\nowe almost everything to a fielding error.

This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country. AJI but number ten Hirwani reached double figures\nand there were 50s for Azhar and More as well. England followed on after\ntrailing by 266 runs. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch (80 in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten 157 by David Gower. It was a summer full of tons and\nruns and yet it was Tendulkar's match-saving knock at Old Trafford\nthat continued to be the talking point of the year. The match\nwas billed as Michael Parkinson's World XI v Indians and ended in a\ndraw. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score 388 in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with 108 not out. The century was reached from 131 balls, including 17 fours, and\nwas the perfect end to a perfect summer ofbatting.\nTendulkar finished with the highest aggregate for the touring side,\nHail the Boy King\n\n65\n\n\fwith 945 runs from 11 matches (19 innings) at the impressive average\nof63.

But\nit was Tendulkar's 52 not out from 40 balls, with five fours, that\nprovided the impetus towards the end of the innings.\nIn the final league match, which India lost to Pakistan under dark\nskies and in controversial circumstances, Tendulkar fell one short of\nanother 50. West Indies were beaten by India in both their league games. In\nthe second of these, Sachin got the Man of the Match award, but not\nfor his batting.

Manjrekar and Tendulkar\nhit identical scores (57) and their stand of 102 stood out starkly in a\npaltry Indian total of 175 for 8 at Hobart. The Indian total of262 for 4 would be the highest\nin a tournament in which the ball generally dominated the bat.\nOn Top Down Under\n\n81\n\n\fSrikkanth-who was making a comeback after being\nunceremoniously dumped following the Palcistan tour-smashed 84\nat almost a run a ball with Manjrekar (55) and Tendulkar (48) helping\nto boost the score. West Indies finally broke their\nwretched run as Cummins' 5-31 bowled them to victory by six wicket<>\nagainst India at Brisbane. Tendulkar's 77 was his highest score in 27\noms and he was now emerging as the most reliable of the Indian\nbatsmen. With the West Indies beating Australia and\nthen India losing to Australia, it came down to the last game.\nWest Indies crawled to 48 for 3 from 25 overs and three run-outs\nensured that they could only reach 175 for 8. Though he did not\nclaim any wickets, Tendulkar gave away just 38 runs in his full quota\nof ten overs. The Indian batting was pinned down by an outstanding\nopening spell by Ambrose: 6-4-3-1. But Man of the Match Tendulkar\nhelped break the shackles with 57 not out, which saw India home by\nfive wickets and into the finals.\nAustralia romped home by eight wickets in the first final at\nMelbourne. India\nneeded 13 off the last over bowled by Whitney.\nTendulkar once again top-scored with 69 from 100 balls, though he\nhad some lucky escapes.\nWith 401 runs from ten innings (one not out) Sachin was the\nleading Indian batsman.\n82\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut for now it was back to the Test series with India down 2-0 after\nthree Tests. The Indian bowling had come in for much flak at the start of the\ntour. But the bowlers had performed creditably, and it was their batting\nthat was the bane of the Indians. The bowlers had their finest hour in\nAustralia's first innings in the fourth Test at Adelaide after Azhar had\nwon the toss and put them in. Kapil Dev and Raju picked up three wickets apiece. And\nTendulkar broke the back of the batting with two vital wickets at the\nstart of the innings. He bowled opener Mark Taylor for 11, and then\nhad Border caught by Pandit for his second duck of the series.\nKapil was having a vintage series with both bat and ball, and his 56\nwas the first half-century of the match. But it was the shocker which\nVengsarkar received in the second innings, stretching well forward to\nHughes, that took the cake and led commentator Ian Chappell to\nblurt out on air, 'If that was not outside the line of the off stump when\nit hit, then I'm a Dutchman. India had all their wickets\nintact and the target was now 340 from 90 overs.\nJust as he had done in England and New Zealand in 1990, he went tor\nthe bowling and tore it apart. Prabhakar ( 64) put on 101 with him for\nthe seventh wicket in less than 90 minutes, and while they were at the\ncrease an improbable Indian victory suddenly loomed large. Azhar was snapped up at slip by\nMark Taylor for 106 as McDermott took the final four wickets to fall,\nincluding Prabhakar lbw off an inside edge. With five wickets in both\ninnings, the Man of the Match award was his. Three Australian batsmen-David Boon, Dean Jones\nand Tom Moody-reached three figures (it was Boon's third century\nof the series) and Mike Whitney took the bowling honours (4-68 and\n7-27). When Kapil had Taylor lbw for 16 on the fourth day, he\nbecame only the second bowler after New Zealand's Sir Richard\nHadlee to reach the milestone of 400 Test wickets. With four wickets\nin the Test, the medium-pacer who had made his debut in 1978 had\nhis best overseas series with 25 victims in all. After Australia's 346, it took\nTendulkar's daring strokes to get his side to within 74 runs in the first\ninnings. A total of 400-plus in the fourth innings was always beyond\nIndia's batsmen.\nTendulkar's century came from only 135 balls, with 14 fours, as he\ncut the formidable Australian pace attack to size in a breathtaking\ndisplay of aggression. The second 50 of the innings came from 55\nballs with six boundaries. He had scored\n114 out of the 140 runs made while at the crease. The innings was\nmarked by cutting and driving of ferocious power and timing. The series saw some dazzling batsmanship on both sides. Tendulkar\nhas it. I enjoyed every moment of his innings. The wicket at Sydney was also rather slow. It was a very nasty and fast wicket and the Australian\nfast bowlers were playing havoc with our batsmen.

The\ntrend was set in the first 001 atjaipur, which England won by four\nwickets after a scrambled single from the last ball of the match. His score of100 not out came from\n149 balls and there was some adverse comment at the end of the game\nover the manner in which he crawled through the 90s.\nThey batted till the end of the innings with Kambli reaching his\ncentury in the last over.

It was here, against England at the Eden Gardens,\nthat Azhar ~ad first dazzled the cricket world with his century on\ndebut in the 1984-85 series, followed by two more on the trot. The captain's dazzling 182 crushed\nEngland's spirits and victory was India's by nine wickets. Tendulkar's\n50 in the first innings promised much more before he had a lapse of\nconcentration and fished at a wide delivery from Devon Malcolm. With just a handful of runs\nneeded for the win after England had followed on, Sachin and Vi nod\nwere at the crease when India wrapped things up before lunch on the\nfifth day. In February 1993, Chepauk was witness to\nTendulkar's first century at home and his fifth overall. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. In 1998, an outstanding innings against Australia saw Sachin\nmaster Shane Warne at Chepauk. But there was heartbreak in 1999:\nanother masterly ton took India to the doorstep of victory against\nPakistan before Sachin's back gave way and India fell just short. Three\nyears later, in March 2001, Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series 2-1. This, after their bowlers\nhad conceded the highest total against India at home. Though he\nbowled just two overs in each innings, he surprised the cognoscenti\nby bowling genuine leg breaks.\nIndia had won the series. A new\nrecord total by India at home, and another innings victory. In only his third Test match, Kambli had\ncompiled the highest score by an Indian batsman against England:\n224. The third wicket stand with Tendulkar was worth 194\nruns in 44 overs, with the senior partner somewhat subdued.\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests: 236 not out by Sunil Gavaskar.\nBefore the series began, the selectors had named Tendulkar captain\nof the under-25 side which played against England at Cuttack prior to\nthe first Test. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India. Also in the team were W V Raman,\nSanjay Manrejkar and Salil Ankola, all with Test experience.\nIt was heady stuf( He was the first Indian left-hander to score more\nthan one Test century and that too, in only his fourth Test. India completed another innings victory\nagainst the hapless Zimbabweans for their fifth win in a row at home.\nThat spectacular run would continue in Sri Lanka where India won a\nTest and a series abroad for the first time since England in 1986 (an\nachievement they have not been able to equal, till the end of2001).\nThe first Test against Sri Lanka, at Kandy, was a washout with only\n106\n\nSachin\n\n\f12 overs bowled. India won the second Test at Colombo's sse by 235\nruns as Tendulkar and Kambli both recorded centuries, though not in\nthe same innings.\nTendulkar too had got a dicey decision in the first innings when he\nwas adjudged caught at short leg for 28, when it was doubtful whether\nhe had played the ball.\nKambli's third hundred saw India score 366 in their first innings.\nAnil Kumble picked up five wickets as the home side trailed by 112.

The sole team to be eliminated\nwas Zimbabwe, with the other semi-final pitting West Indies against\nSri Lanka. Both the semis and the final were played in Kolkata under\nlights for the first time.\nTendulkar had scores of26 not out, 2, 24 and 3. On a slow track, India had mustered a total\nof195 in their 50 overs, with skipper Azharuddin top-scoring with 90.\nMore than the bowlers, it was the Indian batsmen themselves who\nmade a hash of things with four run-outs. Vinod\nKambli was the first such victim in limited-overs cricket. Kumble who picked up two wickets each to break the back of the top\norder and reduce the score to 130 for 5. Srinath had conceded\n23 runs in his last two overs and Prabhakar had gone for 16. It looked like a\ntoss-up between Srinath and Kapil. The problem was that he had not\nbowled a single over so far.\nThere were two wickets standing and six balls to go, with six runs\nto get. Fanie de Villiers was run out going for a\nsecond run.\nTendulkar managed to squeeze the ball between the bat and leg stump. 'I would have\ngiven it to my best bowler. But the young fellow bowled intelligently,'\nhe said. Sachin spoke about that last over in an interview to Sportsworld\n(December 1993). The last ball that I bowled was slightly faster.\nHis figures of 6 for 12 are still the best by an Indian in oms and saw\nWest Indies crumble to 123 in reply to India's 225 for 7. Kambli capped\na brilliant run with the top score of68. Tendulkar chipped in with his\nhighest in the tournament, 28 not out, and then bowled Brian Lara for\n33 just as the West Indian batsman looked to be taking command. Are you aware this is\ncausing the misimpression that you have been failing in\ninternational cricket for a while now. I know I can succeed in one-day cricket also.\nThe specific issue of his low position in the batting order was\ndiscussed in an interview (Sportsworld, December 1993) shortly after\nthe Hero Cup. You could also try and do a 'Brian Lara' by\nopening the innings in one-dayers and then go in at number\nfour in Test matches. The moment came in the Bank ofNew Zealand series\nof four one-day matches early in 1994, which followed the one-off\nTest. New Zealand won the first match at Napier by 28 runs with\nopeners Jadeja and Sidhu putting on 66 runs for India. Tendulkar was\nout for 15.\nThis is what Wadekar told me about the turn of events: 'Sachin\nand I used to talk about his opening the innings in one-dayers so that\nhe would get more overs to thrash the opposition. Sachinjumped in the air with joy and celebrated his\npromotion to the opening slot with a swashbuckling innings. Thus a\nstar opening batsman was born for India in ODis. It was Tendulkar's seventieth ODI and one that would\nchange the face of modern cricket. This is how New Zealand selector\nand journalist Don Neely recalls the match and Tendulkar's innings:\n\n120\n\nSachin\n\n\fNew Zealand made a dismal 142 and in the course of 49.4\novers only managed to hit 9 fours and one six.4 overs, the 100 in 12.\nHis innings of82 consisted ofjust 22 scoring shots and he was\nback in the pavilion in 69 minutes and the game was over with\n26.\nHe was composed, fast on his feet, a master batsman displaying\nhis wares.\nIn the batsman's own words in the Sportstar (23 December 1995), 'I\nthought I could play a few lofted shots and scatter the field. I waited for the first three or four\novers. I gauged the bowling, gained in confidence. Now he was carted for 46\nruns from six overs. But\nactually the Kiwis bowled the way I expected them to.' In panic and not knowing where\nto pitch the ball, Morrison bowled a bouncer so high that it went way\nover Tendulkar's head.\nLarsen was considered the tightest of the Kiwi bowlers. He was\ntaken off after two overs which cost him 24 runs, including two sixes.5 overs.5 overs. The only question\nwas whether Azharuddin's world record of the quickest om centuryoff 61 balls against New Zealand at Baroda in 1989-would be beaten.\nTendulkar raced to 82 from 49 balls (22 scoring shots) before being\ncaught by skipper Ken Rutherford off Pringle. The two had added 56 for\nthe second wicket.\nSeven years later, in April2001, after becoming the first player to\ncross 10,000 ODI runs, Sachin was asked by Vijay Lokapally of the\nSportstar about the thrust his career had got after opening the innings. I was capable of delivering\n122\n\nSachin\n\n\fmore than I was doing at that time, batting so low in the order. In the next game at Wellington, India\nwon by 12 runs and once again, the openers did their job admirably.\nJadeja (56) and Tendulkar (63) put on 103. There was an opening\nstand of61 in the final game at Christchurch, which the home side\nwon by six wickets. The series was levelled, but the gain for the Indian\nteam was immeasurable. The sixnation Austral-Asia Cup was an opportunity for Tendulkar to test his\nnew found skills as opener against the formidable bowling attacks of\nPakistan and Australia. New Zealand, Sri Lanka and the UAE were the\nother teams in the fray.\nTendulkar gave India a blazing start. He raced to his 50 from just\n42 deliveries, and after the match Pakistani captain Salim Malik\nconceded that he had been worried India would reach 280-plus, the\nway the top order went for the bowling. In the end, they could only get\nto 219, which was hardly a challenge for the strong Pakistani batting\nline-up.' Rarely had an Indian batsman treated the\nPakistani bowling with such contemptuous ease. It was Raza's only\nwicket in the match, but what a vital one.\nWith Sidhu and Azhar following Sachin's cue, India were well\nplaced at 164 for 3 when wickets began to fall in a heap. Pakistan\neventually cantered home by six wickets.\nIn the semi-final against Australia, Tendulkar was dismissed\ncheaply by Glenn McGrath, though India won by seven wickets.\nWith Pakistan beating New Zealand by 62 runs in the other semifinal,\nit was once again an India-Pakistan final, just what the organizers and\nfans had hoped for. The Pakistanis took 250 in their innings, a total\nwhich could have been overhauled easily if the Indians had received\nanother good start fromJadeja and Tendulkar. Akram\nremovedJadeja for a duck and then Ata-ur-Rehman struck the vital\nblow when he had Tendulkar caught by Aamir So hail from a full toss\nfor 24. Kambli's 56 was the top score as \u00b7Pakistan completed their\ntwelfth win over India in 15 matches in Sharjah, to win the title for\nthe third time running. Tendulkar's position at the top of the batting\norder was, however, cemented by now.\nThe answer came on 10 September 1994 at the R.\nMter losing the opening match to Sri Lanka by seven wickets,\n124\n\nSachin\n\n\fIndia were desperately looking for a win to keep their hopes alive\nwhen they met Australia. This was Tendulkar's seventy-eighth ODI.\nHis record before the match stood at 2053 runs from 74 innings (nine\nnot out) at 31. He was proved right as India won against Australia by\n31 runs. Craig McDermott,\nGlenn McGrath and Shane Warne were at their wits' end on where to\npitch the ball. Good deliveries as well as bad were treated with equal\ncontempt as Tendulkar launched an attack on Warne that saw him go\nfor 53 runs from his ten overs. India went on to win. the rain-reduced\nfinal against Sri Lanka, though Tendulkar was out for a duck.\nFrom October 1994 following the Singer Cup to December 1995,\nTendulkar played in all oflndia's 19 one-day games. The 19 innings brought him 931 runs at an\naverage of 49, with three more centuries and five 50s as well.", "Wickets_1997": "-Dave Richardson\nThat old tag, 'Tigers at home, kittens abroad,' which has attached itself\nto the Indian team over the 1990s must have been at the back of\nSachin Tendulkar's mind as he prepared himself for his first tour as\ncaptain.\nThe match was over shortly after tea on the third day. India\ncrumbled to 100 and 66---the lowest ever score against South Mrica\nin Test cricket. Both innings together lasted a total of72.3 overs-less\nthan a full day's play-with Allan Donald taking 9 for 54 in the match. In the end,\nthey won by 328 runs and the Indian team was in disarray at the start\nof the series.'\nAs has often happened in Tendulkar's career, the rival bowlers and\nfielders reserved their best for when he was at the crease. In the first\ninnings he was bowled by a beauty from Donald for 15. Donald felt the ball that got Sachin got was\none of the most lethal he had ever bowled in a Test match. Following\ntwo half-volleys which were driven regally to the boundary, Tendulkar\ngot one that pitched on a perfect length just cutside off stump. It\njagged back at such speed that the batsman was still in the process of\nbringing down his bat when the stump was sent cartwheeling in the\ndirection of the stunned wicketkeeper.\nIn the second innings, a sliced drive at Pollock was flying at great\nspeed and some distance from gully.\nIndia were crushed again in the second Test at Cape Town, this\ntime by 282 runs as the home side scaled the series 2-0.\nThe batsmen were Tcndulkar and Azhar, the stand was worth 222,\nthe runs came in 40 uvers and produced 175 minutes of some of the\nmost exhilarating batting seen in the history ofTest cricket.

He had batted for just under three hours and raced to 115 off\n109 balls with 19 fours and a six.\nThe man with the best view was South African wicketkceper Dave\nRichardson and this is what he told me about Tendulkar's innings: 'I\ncan say it was the only occasion when I have honestly enjoyed an\nopposing player scoring a century. Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February 1997):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of 1997 the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n157\n\n\fsublime .

But\nhe did get rather bitter and in a team meeting, said something\nto the effect that the selectors had deliberately named a bowler\nwho has never bowled off spin.\nIndia, with their limited bowling attack, did well to draw the first\nTest at Kingston. Though West Indies were on the decline, they were\nno pushovers, with Ambrose and Walsh still firing away and the batting\nin the safe hands of Lara and Chanderpaul. Half the final day was\nwashed out and India, set 323 to win, finished on 99 for two after an\novewight declaration by Walsh.\nIf this series was to be a match up between Lara and Tendulkar, the\nWest Indian had certainly won the first round. He was at his best in\nthe first innings when he cracked a delightful 83 and followed it up\nwith 78. Tendulkar had scores of7 and 15 not out. The Indian batting received a jolt when\nLaxman was out to Ambrose from the second ball of the innings.\nThereafter, it was safety-first tactics with Navjot Singh Sidhu-back\nfor the series after serving his sentence following the episode in\nEngland-recording the second slowest double century in Test cricket.\nDravid and Sidhu did the initial rescue act in their second wicket\nstand of171. But at no time did the batsmen seek to\nDefeat and Despair\n\n161\n\n\faccelerate the scoring.\nBut their world came crashing around them in the next Test at\nBridgetown, Barbados with a shocking fourth innings collapse. This\nsealed not only the Test, but effectively the series as well for the West\nIndies. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for 298. The innings was held together by Shivnarine\nChanderpaul whose 137 not out was his first century following 13\n50s. For the second time in a row, the Indians gained the first innings\nlead, even if it was only 21 runs.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of 170 runs. His batting was superb as he dispatched anything\nloose with outstanding shot selection.\nThe Indian seamers were back in action in the second innings to\n162\n\nSachin\n\n\frout West Indies for 140, their lowest score against India at home. Lara\ncounter-attacked to top score with 45 and then a last wicket stand\nworth 33 between Ambrose and Dillon pushed the target for India to\n120.\nLara manipulated his bowlers in a masterly manner with only\nAmbrose, Bishop and Rose (debutant Merv Dillon did not get to bowl)\nbeing entrusted with the task of bowling out the Indians. The score of\n81 was their lowest in the West Indies. Tendulkar\nwas done in by the bowler, rather than the pitch. There was\nnot a single partnership worth mention in the second innings and the\ndisgraceful display left a sour note on a tour which had been quite\nDefeat and Despair\n\n163\n\n\fencouraging till then.

Their stand was worth 130 from 29 overs and\nthe score was 157 when the second wicket fell. It came down to 65 off\n68 balls with eight wickets in hand. Unbelievably, those wickets fell in\na heap for India to be all out for 231. Mter the good start, the batsmen\nsimply lashed out at the bowling when the target was well within\nreach.\nWest Indies returned the compliment from the second match by\ncrushing India by ten wickets in the final game, at the venue of their\nsensational Test triumph five weeks earlier.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe most high-profile victim of the West Indies debacle was\nMohammad Azharuddin. It was not only his miserable form on the\ntour, but the way he threw away his wicket on more than one occasion\nthat forced the selectors to take the decision prior to the Independence\nCup four-nation tournament staged in India in the summer of 1997. One\nknock, just one knock from the country's most experienced\ncricketer would have enabled the side to make history. The Kiwis had\nstunned Pakistan in the tournament opener at Mohali. Now their\nbowling was simply torn to pieces as India romped home by eight\nwickets. New Zealand scored 220 for 9 and India made the target in\n42.3 overs. The captain's 117 and his opening stand of 169 with\nGanguly destroyed the bowling, especially medium-pacer Heath Davis\nwho was belted for 4, 6, 4, 4 by Sachin in his third over.\nThe next match in Mumbai was a replay of the previous year's World\nCup semi-final and once again, it was Sri Lanka who came out on top.\nGanguly was bowled first ball by Vaas and then in the fourth over\ncame the breakthrough the Sri Lankans had sought so eagerly.\nThe key game of the tournament was inevitably the India-Pakistan\nclash at Chennai and it created a feast of runs and a world record. If\nPakistan came out on top by 35 runs, it was almost entirely thanks to\nopener Saeed Anwar's 194, which remains the highest score in an 001.\nPakistan's huge 327 for 5 was always going to be a challenge, and once\nTendulkar went early, this time for four, it was left to Rahul Dravid to\nkeep the match alive with his maiden century.\nThe simmering discontent between the Indian selectors and the\ncaptain exploded into the open when the team was announced for the\nAsia Cup to be held in Sri Lanka in July, the next stop in the crazy\nschedule that the Indians were subjected to in 1997.\nMumbai: By the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour\nof 1996, my name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season. Hence on the third day of the third Test\nmatch against England when captain Azharuddin reported unfit\nand I took charge of the team, my captaincy received special\nattention.\nMter India had ~cored 500 runs in the first innings it was\nexpected of me to put pressure on England by placing an\nattacking field and making proper bowling changes. Obviously, my moves were not\nappreciated by cricket lovers. Centuries scored by\nAtherton and Hussain reduced chances of our possible lead in\nthe first innings considerably. Rathore\nwas unfit to bat; Manjrekar and Mongia were to open the\ninnings and were not in good form; Ganguly and Dravid were\nplaying only their second Test; Azharuddin was injured and\nwas not in good form. I thought\none or two quick wickets could have changed the complexion\nof the game and the situation could have been reversed.\nI entered the test arena in 1989 and today when I am at the\nhelm, I find most of the senior players Kapil Dev, Dilip\nConfrontation\n\n171\n\n\fVengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Manoj\nPrabhakar and Kiran More with whom I played at the start of\nmy career, have left the scene.\nDuring the last year, the Indian team, barring Mohd. Rathore, Ganguly, Dravid,\nPrasad and Joshi had played hardly two to three Test matches. In the circumstances, Raman who had not played Test\ncricket for a long time, opened the innings in South Africa.\nSrinath's injury and subsequent return to India at the start of\nthe West Indies tour was a big blow to India's bowling attack.\nAt 65 runs for the loss offour wickets and 170 runs needed to\nwin, victory seemed within their reach. In their second innings South Africa were\nall out for a meagre 1OS runs. The\n172\n\nSachin\n\n\fwicket happened to be the slowest of all the wickets that we\ncame across on that tour. Mter Test matches at home, where we\nhad got used to playing on the front foot because of the low\nbounce on our wickets, we looked forward to getting some\npractice on the bouncy wickets in South Mrica. Incidentally the wicket at Durban for the first Test\nwas perhaps the fastest that I have ever played on. foreign wickets and perform to the best\nof their ability at the beginning of the tour. At the end of the day South\nMrica had lost eight wickets, but had managed to save the game.\nOn that occasion weather had certainly deprived us of a win\nin South Africa; but let us not deprive ourselves of better\nperformances abroad by preparing fast and bouncy wickets at\nhome along with traditional turning wickets.\n\\Vhen we went to the West Indies, Srinath had to leave the\nteam because of a shoulder injury. For a five Test series we were\nleft with only two specialist bowlers in Prasad and Kumble. But\nexcept for the first Test match when the West Indies took the\nlead and put us under pressure, in the remaining four matches\nConfrontation\n\n173\n\n\fwe had the upper hand.\nIn this match too we had put West Indies under pressure on\nthe first three days. We had taken a lead of21 runs in the first\ninnings and then skittled them out for a mere 140 odd runs.\nBut at the end of the third day the wicket had deteriorated\nconsiderably and the experts like Sunil Gavaskar, Geoff Boycott\nand Michael Holding were unanimous in their opinion, even\nbefore our innings started, that it was going to be very difficult\nto score those runs. The beginning of our second innings was\ngoing to be of the utmost importance.\nSidhu's wicket confirmed our doubts about the deteriorating\npitch. I will not blame the wicket entirely, but some accurate\nbowling, excellent field placing, and to some extent bad batting\ncontributed to our loss. I remember a similar situation when in\n1982 one of the strongest batting line-ups ofan Australian team\ncomprising Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Allan Border, Kim\nHughes, Graeme Wood, John Dyson and Rodney Marsh, could\nnot achieve a target of only 129 runs against India on a bad\nMelbourne wicket.\nEven the 1996 World Cup winning Sri Lankan team has\ndeveloped into a winning combination over a period of time\nand has reached such heights in one-day cricket only recently\nand in Test cricket too their present performances indicate that\n174\n\nSachin\n\n\fthey are a side to reckon with. I happened to witness his batting during\nSri Lanka's tour of India in 1993-94. He was not known to\nmany as a batsman of the calibre as he is known today.\nTendulkar was in form in the two Tests, scoring 143 in the first and\n139 in the first innings of the second. But all other feats were\novershadowed by Sri Lanka's world record total of952 for 6 wickets in\nthe first Test at the R. Roshan Mahanama (225)\nand Sanath Jayasuriya (340) broke all partnership records for Test\ncricket with their second wicket stand of576 runs. The Indian bowling,\nstill without Srinath, had run out of answers. Indian cricket was at a\npretty low ebb. Pakistan too were without their two strike\nbowlers, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. They got him 15 wickets,\nincluding two in the third match which was declared a 'no-result' due\nto rain.\nAdded to these wickets was Ganguly's total of222 runs, more than\nenough to make him the obvious choice for Man of the Series.\nThe wickets were seamer friendly, and the batsmen struggled in\nthe first four matches. For once, India came\nout on top despite Tendulkar not being among the runs. The Wills Challenge Cup series of three matches was the first\ntime since his debut in 1989 that Tendulkar was playing in Pakistan. Beaten by five wickets in the first ODI\nat Hyderabad (Sind), India came storming h::tck to win the second at\nKarachi in the last over. Pakistan had reached\n265 for 4 in 47.2 overs at that stage.\nSri Lanka had been whitewashed 3-0 when they toured India in 1994. This time, all the three\nTests they played in India were drawn. So was the ODI series, played on\nIndia's return from Sharjah. India won the first at Guwahati by se~\u00b7en\nwickets and lost the third at Margao by five. In between, the second at\nIndore had to be abandoned after just three overs because ofa dangerous\npitch. This meant that India had played 12 Tests Uust three at home)\nin 1997 without a single victory, though at Mumbai in the third Test\nagainst Sri Lanka they were thwarted by rain when well on top, as had\nhappened earlier in the year in South Mrica.\naffecting his batting was nonsense, at least in Test matches. The ODI figures for the year, though, did show a\ndecline-1011 runs in 39 matches at 30. And of those 39 matches, India had managed only ten wins. There\nwere 23 defeats as well as one tic and five 'no-results'. India hit the depths, beaten by England (seven runs),\nPakistan (four wickets) and West Indies (41 runs). To add to his\nhumiliation by the selectors, Tendulkar had also now been ordered to\nbat lower down the order. The nadir was reached in the third and final match against\nthe West Indies. Chasing229 for 6, India crumbled to 188. His running between the wickets\nshocked everybody and it was no surprise when he was run out for\nfour, going for a non-existent second run.\n\n180\n\nSachin.", "Wickets_1998": "Desert Storm\n\nI'll be having nightmares of Sachin just running down the wicket and belting\nrne back over the head for six.-Shane Warne\nA mere three days after India lost to Australia in the final of the Pepsi\nCup, the two teams were in Sharjah for the Coca-Cola Cup, with\nNew Zealand joining the fray. Just four months before, the\nIndian team had been the object of derision, and the captain had been\ndisplaced after they had crashed to three defeats in a row. It was\nIndia's first win in Sharjah after five straight defeats. The next day, the\nKiwis were brushed aside by six wickets by Australia, and now it was\nthe turn of the Big Two to clash in their first league encounter, which\nwas ex-pected to be a dress rehearsal for the final. His 80 was\nthe highest score of the match and won him the Man of the Match\naward. The nightmare ofDecember 1997 seemed to have returned\nto haunt the Indians; the very next day; they went down by four wickets\nto New Zealand. The Kiwis excelled in the field and three oflndia's\ntop batsmen-Tendulkar, Azhar and Jadeja-were run out. In the end, India lost, but still made it to the final.

It was Sachin's twenty-fifth birthday\nThe stage was just right-India v Australia in front of25,000 Indian\nfans. In the end, they made it relatively easily, winning\nby six wickets with nine balls to spare. Tendulkar's share this time\nround was 134 from 131 balls, with 12 fours and three sixes.'

This was the twin load borne by the\nmodern player, especially by those playing for India, who over the last\nfew years had been saddled with a massive schedule of international\nmatches. Tendulkar was rested for the\nfirst two matches, apparently much against his own wishes. He contributed 33 as India won by five wickets, as they had\ndone in the first match.\nAlready assured of a place in the final, the Indians were beaten by 69\nruns, with Tendulkar falling for 18. The former captain's\ncontribution was 100 not out from 103 balls.

This time round, all three league matches at Galle had to be\ncalled off without a ball being bowled. Colombo also saw two 'noresults', and New Zealand gained points without winning a single\nmatch.\nThe opening game of the tournament saw India record one of its\nmost emphatic victories over Sri Lanka. Openers Ganguly (80) and\nTendulkar (65) put on a sparkling 115 in 18 overs, easily overhauling\nSri Lanka's 243 for 6, with eight wickets and plenty of deliveries to\nspare.2\novers, Tendulkar (53) galloping to his 50 in 33 balls, in reply to New\nZealand's 219 for 8. If that had happened,\nIndia would have needed 147 runs in 25 overs to be deemed winners.\nMter a week of nearly non-stop rain at Galle, the action moved\nback to Colombo, and this time it was Sri Lanka who nosed out India\nby eight runs in a match reduced to 36 overs a side. The\nIndian innings was marked by a world record opening stand of252\nruns from 43 overs by Ganguly and Tendulkar. Both got centuries,\nwith Tendulkar in his one hundred and ninty-sixth ODI now level\nwith Haynes after his 128 from 131 balls. It was Tendulkar's third\ncentury and third Man of the Match award in three consecutive triseries finals in the span of three months, India having won all three.\nManuel took his time over the stumping appeal offJayasuriya, even\nas it appeared that the batsman's right toe was within the crease.

Though the usual tension\nassociated with an official international match was obviously missing,\nthe cricket was played seriously.\nMCC XI scored 261 for 4 in the allotted 50 overs, with West Indian\nleft-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul top-scoring with 127 not out. The MCC attack was formidable,\nwith Allan Donald, Srinath, Glenn McGrath and Kumble. The two added 177 and\nensured their team won the match by six wicket~ with plenty to spare. By the time he was bowled by Kumble fat 125, he had batted for\n114 balls, with 15 fours and four sixes. Even the bowlers were impressed.', something he\nhad never said to a batsman at any time in his career. That one player, naturally, was Sachin\nTendulkar.\nIndia were struggling at 30 for 2 in 9.4 overs when rain washed out\ntheir opening match against Antigua and Barbuda, spearheaded by\nCurtly Ambrose, with Sir Viv Richards as their coach. There\nwas an even bigger shock in the next game against Canada, with the\nbest batsman in the world out for two, the victim of an unknown 35On Top of the World\n\n215\n\n\fyear-old from Granada by the name ofDavisJoseph.\nThe last league match against Australia was a do-or-die game for\nIndia. Australia were struggling at 84 for 5 before skipper Steve Waugh\nscored a century, an innings which he said was his 'most satisfYing' in\none-day cricket-though it will not be in the record books. This time\nTendulkar scored 45 before he fell to Damien Fleming. Indian cricket had striven in\n1998 to overcome the traumas of the year before.\nSachin landed in Toronto after 20 overs of the fourth game had\nbeen bowled. Still jet-lagged from his marathon flight, he managed to crack\n77 in India's total of 256 for 9 in the fifth and final match; skipper\nAzhar top-scored with 101. But it wasn't enough and Pakistan romped\nhome by five wickets to take the series 4-1.'\n216\n\nSachin\n\n\fStraight from Toronto, it was off to Zimbabwe for the weary Indians. There was\nsome consolation, though, in the one-day series which India claimed\n2-1 at the start of the short tour. And at Bulawayo in the opening\ngame, Tendulkar scored his eighteenth ODI century to overtake West\nIndian opener Desmond Haynes' world record. Tendulkar's eighteenth came four years\nafter his first in Colombo in 1994. But it took\nSachin 46 innings (in his hundred and ninety-eighth om) fewer than\nthe West Indian and that is the true barometer. Ten of Tendulkar's\ntons had come abroad and the rest at home. It meant that Indian\nbatsmen now held the record for most centuries in Tests (34 by Sunil\nGavaskar) and oms. Sachin's 127 not out in India's eight-wicket win\nwas his sixth of the year, and there would be more to follow. South Mrica\nlifted the Wills Trophy, beating the West Indies by four wickets in the\nfinal. Tendulkar left his mark on the tournament in the third quarterfinal where India faced Australia, this time minus Warne and McGrath. Then Tendulkar\nand Dravid began the rebuilding and Jadeja weighed in with 71 to\ntake India past the 300-run mark. Tendulkar was awesome. By the\ntime he was smartly run out for 141 from 127 balls, he had smashed\n13 fours and three sixes and the Indian total of307 for 8 was a formidable\none. They were 145 for 2 when Tendulkar\nwas tossed the ball and started conjuring up wickets with his assortment\nof 'offies' and 'leggies'. He accounted for Steve Waugh, caught ancl\nOn Top of the World\n\n217\n\n\fbowled, and then added Michael I3evan, Damien Martyn and Brad\nYoung to his bag. Only Viv Richards\nhas scored a century and taken five wickets in an ODI. Tendulkar came\npretty close, and the Australians were all out for 263. He listed the 141\nas his greatest innings in an interview with Sebastian Coe (Daily\nTelegraph, 6 May 2001): 'Nobody expected us to win.'\nThe innings also took Sachin past his own record for most ODI\nruns in a year. In 1996 he had 1611 in 32 matches. Now in 1998, in 34\nmatches (33 innings, four not out) he would compile 1894 runs at\n65.\"t match, the\nsemi-final against the West Indies, in which they were beaten by six\nwickets with Tendulkar out at eight.\nIt was back to Sharjah then, for the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy,\nwith Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka as the competition. Despite both their prolific\nopeners falling cheaply, India won their opening match against the\nSri Lankans by three wickets. Tendulkar notched up his twentieth century\nagainst Zimbabwe for a grand total of 36 centuries in international\ncricket, taking him past Sunil Gavaskar, Viv Richards and Desmond\nHaynes, all of whom had a combined Test and ODI total of35 centuries. Chasing a\nmeagre total of205 for 7, the Indian batsmen were rocked by a searing\nspell from the dreadlocked fast bowler, in which he had the prize\nscalps of Ganguly, Tend ulkar, Dravid and Jadeja-the cream of the\ncrop. It was Olonga's first match of the tournament and the fact that he\n218\n\nSachin\n\n\fmade a master like Tendulkar look uncomfortable at the crease was\nthe talking point when the two teams met in the final 48 hours later. He has\nalways taken it as a personal challenge to go after the best bowler in the\nopposition, as in the case of McGrath and Warne.\nAnd perhaps for the first time in a tournament, without the loss of a\nsingle wicket. It was India's fifth tournament title of the year in their\nrecord-breaking fortieth ODI in 1998. They also won the ODI series in\nZimbabwe.\nTendulkar's 124 not out was virtually double that of his partner\nGanguly's contribution (63), a measure ofhis total domination at the\ncrease. It was close to the Indian\nrecord held by Azhar (62 balls). The stand with Ganguly fetched 112 in the\nfirst 15 overs as Tendulkar went hell for leather after a dropped catch\nwhen he was on 53, offleg-spinner Paul Strang who was carted for 45\nruns from his five overs. Forty-one were smashed from Olonga's first\nfour overs, 28 of which came from Tendulkar's bat. Then he pulled the hapless\nbowler from outside off stump.\nTendulkar had another world record to his credit-32 Man of the\nMatch awards in 207 matches, against 31 in 187 by Viv Richards. 'I\ndecided to enjoy my batting. 'Olonga is an\ninternational bowler. He can bowl some good deliveries and he got\nOn Top of the World\n\n219\n\n\fmy wicket. India had not won a series in New\nZealand since the first in 1967-68 and the trend continued as they\nwere beaten 1-0 while the 001 series was locked at 2-2. Mter the first\nTest had been completely washed out, New Zealand won the second\nat Wellington by four wickets, despite centuries by Azhar and\nTendulkar. He followed with\nscores of 23, 45 and 5, but had to miss the fifth and final match at\nChristchurch (the third was a 'no-result') after suffering a wrist injury\nin the fourth game at Auckland.\n\n220\n\nSachin\n.", "Wickets_2001": "Foot Fault\n\nThere cannot be another Sachin Tendulkar.

The formidable Aussie\nfast bowling attack of Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney and Merv\nHughes blew away the Indians in the space of three and a half days by\nthe thumping margin of ten wickets. On the third day, Kapil\nDev produced what Australian opening batsman David Boon described\nas 'the best three balls bowled consecutively that I have seen in Test\ncricket'. Boon was at the non-striker's end as Kapil bowled an inswinger to Allan Border of such perfect length that any left-hander\nwould have been bowled off-stump. The second ball, an outswinger\n\n\fto Dean Jones, beat bat and stump by a coat of varnish. The next ball\nwas brought back and bowled Jones for a duck. There were also some\nbatting heroics from Manoj Prabhakar who stayed at the crease for\nover five hours. The Test marked the debut ofJavagal Srinath who\npicked up three wickets.\nThe traditional Boxing Day Test at Melbourne followed much the\nsame pattern, the margin of victory for Australia this time being eight\nwickets. Tendulkar had been a\ndisappointment so far, as was the Indian batting as a whole. His first\nthree innings had produced scores of16, 7 and 15. But in the second\ninnings at Melbourne, he hit a cultured 40 with five fours before a\nrush of blood saw him caught in the deep off spinner Peter Taylor. It was surprising\nthen that India went in for the third Test with only one spinner (Ravi\nShastri), with Venkatapathy Raju and Narendra Hirwani having to\ncool their heels. Shastri emerged as the Man of the Match for the first\ndouble century by an Indian against Australia and four wickets in the\nsecond innings, which almost saw India pull off a shock victory. David Boon's 129 not out was the standout\ninnings in Australia's total of 313. But they had a stroke of\nluck when their tormentor in the previous Test, Bruce Reid, limped\noff with a torn muscle in the side after bowling just four overs, and\ntook no further part in the Test. That was just the chance the Indian\nbatting needed to finally come good after the defeats at Brisbane and\nMelbourne. Opener Shastri batted nearly ten hours for his 206 before\nbecoming the only victim ofleg-spinner Shane Warne who finished\n78\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith 1 for 150 on his Test debut. The record stand\nfor the fifth wicket between Shastri and Tendulkar was worth 196 in\n198 minutes and as Shastri moved towards his first Test double century,\nTendulkar took centre stage with an array of dazzling shots that had\nthe spectators riveted. The fourth day's play belonged to Tendulkar as\nhe reached his century in 226 minutes from 171 balls, the youngest to\ndo so on Australian soil.\nAt 18 years and 256 days, Sachin had surpassed the previous record\nheld by Australian left-handed legend Neil Harvey who had made\n153 against India at Melbourne in 1948, at the age of19 years and 121\ndays, 25 years before Tendulkar was born.

With\nthe wicket taking plenty of spin on the final day, Azhar in desperation\nturned to Tendulkar to bowl some off spin. And he claimed his first\nTest wicket in his only over when he had the obdurate Merv Hughes\ncaught by Prabhakar for 21.\nDavid Frith summed up the match eloquently in Wisden Cricket\nMonthly (February 1992): 'Tendulkar's creamy elegance, power and\nprecocity had even the local partisans cooing . It was bad luck for\nShastri that his double-century and his wickets will take second place\nin public memory behind Tendulkar's beautiful century.'\nBetween Test matches, India, Australia and the West Indies were\ninvolved in the World Series Cup (wsc) in which India had lost in the\nfinals in 1985-86.\nThe tri-series began in sensational style at Perth on 6 December\n1991 with Sachin Tendulkar getting the last West Indies wicket to\nearn a tie for India.

The Indian bowling had come in for much flak at the start of the\ntour. But the bowlers had performed creditably, and it was their batting\nthat was the bane of the Indians. The bowlers had their finest hour in\nAustralia's first innings in the fourth Test at Adelaide after Azhar had\nwon the toss and put them in. Kapil Dev and Raju picked up three wickets apiece. And\nTendulkar broke the back of the batting with two vital wickets at the\nstart of the innings. He bowled opener Mark Taylor for 11, and then\nhad Border caught by Pandit for his second duck of the series.\nKapil was having a vintage series with both bat and ball, and his 56\nwas the first half-century of the match.\nIndeed, eight Indian batsmen would be given out leg before in this\nTest, against two for the Australians. But it was the shocker which\nVengsarkar received in the second innings, stretching well forward to\nHughes, that took the cake and led commentator Ian Chappell to\nblurt out on air, 'If that was not outside the line of the off stump when\nit hit, then I'm a Dutchman. India had all their wickets\nintact and the target was now 340 from 90 overs.\nJust as he had done in England and New Zealand in 1990, he went tor\nthe bowling and tore it apart. Prabhakar ( 64) put on 101 with him for\nthe seventh wicket in less than 90 minutes, and while they were at the\ncrease an improbable Indian victory suddenly loomed large. Azhar was snapped up at slip by\nMark Taylor for 106 as McDermott took the final four wickets to fall,\nincluding Prabhakar lbw off an inside edge. With five wickets in both\ninnings, the Man of the Match award was his. The series could so\neasily have been 2-2 going into the final Test at Perth. Three Australian batsmen-David Boon, Dean Jones\nand Tom Moody-reached three figures (it was Boon's third century\nof the series) and Mike Whitney took the bowling honours (4-68 and\n7-27). When Kapil had Taylor lbw for 16 on the fourth day, he\nbecame only the second bowler after New Zealand's Sir Richard\nHadlee to reach the milestone of 400 Test wickets. With four wickets\nin the Test, the medium-pacer who had made his debut in 1978 had\nhis best overseas series with 25 victims in all. After Australia's 346, it took\nTendulkar's daring strokes to get his side to within 74 runs in the first\ninnings. A total of 400-plus in the fourth innings was always beyond\nIndia's batsmen.\nTendulkar's century came from only 135 balls, with 14 fours, as he\ncut the formidable Australian pace attack to size in a breathtaking\ndisplay of aggression. The second 50 of the innings came from 55\nballs with six boundaries. He had scored\n114 out of the 140 runs made while at the crease.

Both the semis and the final were played in Kolkata under\nlights for the first time.\nTendulkar had scores of26 not out, 2, 24 and 3. On a slow track, India had mustered a total\nof195 in their 50 overs, with skipper Azharuddin top-scoring with 90.\nMore than the bowlers, it was the Indian batsmen themselves who\nmade a hash of things with four run-outs. Vinod\nKambli was the first such victim in limited-overs cricket. Kumble who picked up two wickets each to break the back of the top\norder and reduce the score to 130 for 5. Srinath had conceded\n23 runs in his last two overs and Prabhakar had gone for 16. It looked like a\ntoss-up between Srinath and Kapil. The problem was that he had not\nbowled a single over so far.\nThere were two wickets standing and six balls to go, with six runs\nto get.\nTendulkar managed to squeeze the ball between the bat and leg stump.

You could also try and do a 'Brian Lara' by\nopening the innings in one-dayers and then go in at number\nfour in Test matches. The moment came in the Bank ofNew Zealand series\nof four one-day matches early in 1994, which followed the one-off\nTest. New Zealand won the first match at Napier by 28 runs with\nopeners Jadeja and Sidhu putting on 66 runs for India.

The two had added 56 for\nthe second wicket.\nSeven years later, in April2001, after becoming the first player to\ncross 10,000 ODI runs, Sachin was asked by Vijay Lokapally of the\nSportstar about the thrust his career had got after opening the innings.

The Pakistanis took 250 in their innings, a total\nwhich could have been overhauled easily if the Indians had received\nanother good start fromJadeja and Tendulkar.

Just four months before, the\nIndian team had been the object of derision, and the captain had been\ndisplaced after they had crashed to three defeats in a row. Now\nTendulkar was determined to prove a point to the spectators who had\ninsulted him and his team in December 1997. It was\nIndia's first win in Sharjah after five straight defeats. His 80 was\nthe highest score of the match and won him the Man of the Match\naward.

He contributed 33 as India won by five wickets, as they had\ndone in the first match.\nAlready assured of a place in the final, the Indians were beaten by 69\nruns, with Tendulkar falling for 18.

Suddenly the Prince of\nTrinidad was being proclaimed the king of cricket.\nLara had first announced himself with a sublime innings of277\n(run out) against Australia at Sydney in December 1992, his maiden\nTest century. But it took him two years to establish\nhimself in the West Indian team. No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in 1994.\nThere were more troubles ahead after the West Indies were edged\nout of the 1996 World Cup semi-finals by Australia. The West Indies\nCricket Board reprimanded Lara after several verbal outbursts by him.\nBy now, he had made it clear to one and all that he was determined to\nbe captain of the West Indies and that he would allow nothing and\nnobody to get in his way. Lara did get his chance in the Barbados Test\nagainst India in March 1997. Leading India was Tendulkar. Things seemed to be looking\nup as the West Indies won the Tests 3-1 and the ODI series 4-1. The West Indies were\nhumiliated on their first tour ofSouth Mrica, crushed 5-0 in the Test\nseries and 6-1 in the oms. Bowled out by Australia for an all-time low of 51 and crushed\nby 314 runs in the first Test, the end appeared near for the West Indies\nand not for the last time either.' And finally,\nSir Donald Bradman in Roland Perry's Bradman's Best: 'Lara and\nTendulkar have proved to be the two best batsmen in the 1990s.\nLara and Tendulkar came face to face in a Test series for the first\ntime when West Indies toured India late in 1994 under Walsh's\ncaptaincy. Lara had two 50s with a top\nscore of 91 in the third Test at Mohali, which West Indies won to\nsquare the series.\nBefore the series against the West Indies, it was Sri Lanka's turn to be\nflattened by the Indian steamroller early in 1994, losing all three Tests\nby an innings.\nThe West Indies under Walsh wete expected to give India a run for\ntheir money in the winter of 1994. India had not lost a series at home\nsince 1987; West Indies had not lost a series anywhere for 15 years. Indian cricket fans\nwere also keen to see world record holder Lara in action. But as\nthe day wore on, the pitch eased out and the Mumbai pair ofManjrekar\nand Tendulkar took the game away from the West Indies. The target for the West Indies (363) was beyond their\nreach, and Srinath finished with 4 for 48 and the Man of the Match\naward. The West Indies, let off the hook then,\nstaged a fightback at Mohali in the third and final Test to salvage their\npride and unbeaten record.'\nSidhu and Tendulkar wrested control of the West Indies' attack\nafter off-spinner Carl Hooper had got rid of Prabhakar and Kambli\ncheaply.\nThe West Indies stormed back to take the third Test at Mohali and\ndraw the series. The West Indies had a first\ninnings lead of 57.\nLara (91) in the role of opener finally sparkled in the second innings\nwhen his team was looking for quick runs. The disappointment of the Test series was offset\nto some extent by winning both the ODI tri-series (New Zealand were\nthe third team) and the one-day series against the West Indies, that too\nby a convincing 4-1 margin.\nTendulkar started off the 001 series against the West Indies with\ntwo successive ducks. In the final against West\nIndies at Calcutta, Man of the Match Tendulkar was top scorer with\n66 and returned figures of1 for 35 from eight overs as India won by 72\nruns.\nLara and Tendulkar came head-to-head again in the Carribean in\n2002. West Indies captain Carl Hooper admitted the pressure got\nthe better of Lara in the second Test which India won.\nThere was rare success for India in Sharjah in April 1995. Tendulkar scored his fourth\nODI century of the 1994-95 season in the league game against Sri\nLanka which India won by eight wickets.\nMeanwhile, back home Tendulkar had been appointed captain of\nMumbai for the 1994-95 Ranji Trophy season, and it turned out to be\na season of triumph for both the team and the captain, culminating in\na century in both innings in the final against Punjab. Mumbai\nhad won all their West Zone league matches for the first time in 37\nyears. Apart from 856 runs in the\nRanji Trophy that year, he had struck his first ODI century as well as\ntons against New Zealand at Baroda, West Indies atJaipur and against\nSri Lanka in the Asia Cup in Sharjah. He had 285 runs in the Wills World\nSeries, 247 in the Pepsi one-day series against the West Indies and 402\nruns in three Tests against the same team. They\nstarted the season by winning the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in\nSeptember 1994 and ended it with the triumph in the Asia Cup in\nSharjah in April 1995. At home, the West Indies were beaten 4-1 in\nthe 001 series, and India also won the Wills World Series triangular\ntournament. For Sachin, it was a memorable year: his first 001 century,\nfirst Ranji Trophy triumph, first century against the West Indies, the\nAsia Cup .", "West_Indies_1997": " Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February 1997):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of 1997 the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n157\n\n\fsublime .

Indeed, 1997 would probably be the most hectic\never, with tours to South Mrica, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,\nToronto and Sharjah for Test and 001 tournaments, as well as home\ngames. 'If any of\nthem [Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad] breaks down in the West Indies. West Indies tour, as Prem Panicker of Rediffcom\ntestified.\nI was at the CCI that day, when the selectors were picking the\nside to tour the We.st Indies. Though West Indies were on the decline, they were\nno pushovers, with Ambrose and Walsh still firing away and the batting\nin the safe hands of Lara and Chanderpaul.\nIf this series was to be a match up between Lara and Tendulkar, the\nWest Indian had certainly won the first round. Only twice before had India won Test matches in the\nCaribbean and both were played in the Trinidad capital.\nBut their world came crashing around them in the next Test at\nBridgetown, Barbados with a shocking fourth innings collapse. This\nsealed not only the Test, but effectively the series as well for the West\nIndies.\nLara led the West Indies for the first time, since Walsh was declared\nunfit. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for 298.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of 170 runs.\nThe Indian seamers were back in action in the second innings to\n162\n\nSachin\n\n\frout West Indies for 140, their lowest score against India at home. Lara\ncounter-attacked to top score with 45 and then a last wicket stand\nworth 33 between Ambrose and Dillon pushed the target for India to\n120.\nThere was tremendous tension all round at the Kensington Oval\non the fourth (and final) day as India sought to earn only their third\nvictory in nearly 50 years in the Caribbean. The score of\n81 was their lowest in the West Indies. Wtsden Cricket Monthly (May 1997) compared the\nperformances of the two 'superstar captains'. 'I think it\nwas a combination of good bowling by the West Indies, bad batting by\nus nd a terrible track,' he said when asked 'What really went wrong at\nBarbados.\nWest Indies easily won the opening game by eight wickets but\nwere stunned in the second at the same venue.\nGanguly was back for the second match. Kuruvilla and debutant David skittled out the West Indies\nfor 121, their lowest against India in an 001.\nAll the good work was undone by two awful batting displays as the\nWest Indies ran away 3-1 winners.\nChasing 250 for victory, the Indians were coasting with Ganguly\nand Dravid at the crease.\nWest Indies returned the compliment from the second match by\ncrushing India by ten wickets in the final game, at the venue of their\nsensational Test triumph five weeks earlier.", "Difficult_1994": "", "Match_Tendulkar_1994": "-Sachin Tendulkar\nSachin Tendulkar hates comparisons. In 1996, when\nSir Donald Bradman created a sensation in the Indian media by going\non record that the Indian master's batting reminded him ofhis own,\nTendulkar was honoured. Among his\ncontemporaries, comparisons have most frequently been made\nbetween Tendulkar and the West Indian batting genius, Brian Lara. Mter the series, champion Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah\nMuralitharan was quoted as saying he found it more difficult to bowl\nto Lara than Tendulkar. 'Lara and Tendulkar are the hardest batsmen\nto bowl against, but the West Indian has troubled me more. Tendulkar\nis positive and difficult to bowl against, but I have an advantage over\nhim because he is a right-hander. Still, he has a long way to go to catch up\nwith Tendulkar's current record and has rapidly fallen behind after\nhis golden year of 1994. In 1997, Lara scored 394 runs\nat 39.40 while Tendulkar's figures were 1000 runs at 62.87 for Tendulkar); in 1999 Lara's 737 runs\nwere scored at an average of27.29 compared to Tendulkar's 1088 at\n68. In 2000 the comparative figures were: Tendulkar: 575 runs at\n63.23; and in 2001 Lara had 1151 runs at 63.94\nwhile Tendulkar's record was 1003 at 62.\nIn the fifth Test against England at St. It made\nLara the first batsman after Bradman to simultaneously hold the record\nfor the highest Test and first-class score.\nLara had first announced himself with a sublime innings of277\n(run out) against Australia at Sydney in December 1992, his maiden\nTest century. Tendulkar, it may be recalled, had taken more than ten\nyears to score his first double century. The Trinidadian's appetite for\nmassive scores appeared insatiable while Tendulkar's seeming\nimpatience at the crease saw him fai.\nLara is four years older than Tendulkar. No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in 1994. Lara did get his chance in the Barbados Test\nagainst India in March 1997. Leading India was Tendulkar. Back home in India\naround the same time, Tendulkar too resigned from the captaincy that\nhad been thrust on him for the second time, late in 1999.\nAlmost every current and ex-cricketer ranks Tendulkar above Lara\nin contemporary cricket, though as we have seen, it was not always\nthat way. Allan Donald, for one, thought that Tendulkar was in a\ndifferent class to Lara as a professional cricketer. He also considered Tendulkar the\nbest batsman in the world, pulling away from Brian Lara every year.\nWriting in Sportsworld (May 1995), 'Tiger' Pataudi commented:\n'Tendulkar, I reckon is even more talented than Lara, but he is yet to\ndevelop the latter's temperament and so often pleases to tease.' And in\nGe1frey Boycott on Cricket: 'The way in which he [Tendulkar] reacted\n[to losing the captaincy in 1998] at a time of great stress illustrates the\ndifference between Tendulkar, who did not cause a moment's fuss or\ntrouble, and the petulant Lara. The product of a careful upbringing in\nIndia, Tendulkar, despite his superstar status, simply refused to waste\nhis time in altercations with the Indian board and selectors.' And finally,\nSir Donald Bradman in Roland Perry's Bradman's Best: 'Lara and\nTendulkar have proved to be the two best batsmen in the 1990s.\n130\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar has a very strong defence. Tendulkar\nis proving more consistent.'\nAs though to clinch the issue, Tendulkar was the only\ncontemporary cricketer to find a place in Sir Dan's controversial\n'Dream Team' released by Perry shortly after the legend's death in\nFebruary 2001.\nLara and Tendulkar came face to face in a Test series for the first\ntime when West Indies toured India late in 1994 under Walsh's\ncaptaincy. But Tendulkar certainly\nhad the better of the exchanges, averaging double that of Lara (67 to\n33), with a century and two half-centuries. Lara had two 50s with a top\nscore of 91 in the third Test at Mohali, which West Indies won to\nsquare the series. He failed to register a century in either the Tests,\nthe first-class tour matches or the numerous ODIS. And he was\nsuspended for one 001 by match referee Raman Subba Row.\nBefore the series against the West Indies, it was Sri Lanka's turn to be\nflattened by the Indian steamroller early in 1994, losing all three Tests\nby an innings. Opener Sidhu\nbattered the Sri Lankan bowlers as he smashed eight sixes in his 124.\nBut it was Tendulkar's 142 that was a class apart.\n'Sidhu helped me a lot,' said Tendulkar after his seventh Test\ncentury.' Poised at 88 at the end of the first day,\nSachin reached his ton the next morning from just four balls from\nmedium-pacer Pramodya Wickramasinghe. It was\ntenacious batting in both innings by the Indians and an outstanding\nspell of fast bowling in the second by Srinath that swung the match\nIndia's way. Wicketkeeper NayanMongia (80) was\nthe utdikely top scorer and his sixth-wicket stand of 136 with\nManjrekar (51) took India to the respectable total of272. Left-arm\nspinner Raju then picked up five wickets to give India a kad of 29\nruns. This allowed the sting to be\ndrawn from the wicket, and that was all the Indian batsmen needed. But as\nthe day wore on, the pitch eased out and the Mumbai pair ofManjrekar\nand Tendulkar took the game away from the West Indies. Tendulkar's\n85 (he was the joint top scorer in the Test with Junior Murray) was a\nperfect blend of attack and defence, while Manjrekar came up with his\nIll\n\nSachin\n\n\fsecond 50 of the match. Tendulkar straight drove Walsh and worked\nhim off his pads for fours and then forced the removal ofleg-spinner\nDhanraj, hitting him for a six over long on and a four over mid-off. Tendulkar's 85 came from\n139 balls before he sliced an offbreak from Hooper to be caught behind.\nThe tail wagged furiously with Kumble (42) and Srinath (60) flogging\nthe bowling. The target for the West Indies (363) was beyond their\nreach, and Srinath finished with 4 for 48 and the Man of the Match\naward. The West Indies, let off the hook then,\nstaged a fightback at Mohali in the third and final Test to salvage their\npride and unbeaten record. Nagpur saw Tendulkar score his first\ncentury against the West Indies as India built up a formidable 546 for\n9 declared and claimed a first innings lead of 118 runs.'\nThis was Sidhu's sixth century, and in the last four he had been joined\non three figures by Tendulkar. The two were proving to be India's\nbatting mainstays. Tendulkar had come off two ducks in a row at\nFaridabad and Mumbai in the one-day series and had been feeling the\npressure.'\nSidhu and Tendulkar wrested control of the West Indies' attack\nafter off-spinner Carl Hooper had got rid of Prabhakar and Kambli\ncheaply. Tendulkar's back-foot shots went like bullets, as did his straight\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\nIll\n\n\fdrives. The double century partnership with his captain was the\nfirst over 200 in which Tendulkar was associated. The 179 was his\nhighest Test score till then and it took a brilliant, diving catch by Lara\nat mid wicket offWalsh to terminate it; he faced 319 balls and hit 24\nfours and a six. There\nwas another century stand between Sidhu (76) and Tendulkar (54) in\nthe second innings, for the third wicket.\nThe West Indies stormed back to take the third Test at Mohali and\ndraw the series. The Indian innings was marked by a maiden\ncentury by Manoj Prabhakar. Manjrekar and Tendulkar both chipped\nin with 40 while Srinath (52) was once again a revelation with the bat.\nLara (91) in the role of opener finally sparkled in the second innings\nwhen his team was looking for quick runs. India looked to Tendulkar, as usual.\nTendulkar started off the 001 series against the West Indies with\ntwo successive ducks. In the final against West\nIndies at Calcutta, Man of the Match Tendulkar was top scorer with\n66 and returned figures of1 for 35 from eight overs as India won by 72\nruns.\nLara and Tendulkar came head-to-head again in the Carribean in\n2002. Tendulkar scored his fourth\nODI century of the 1994-95 season in the league game against Sri\nLanka which India won by eight wickets. The margin of victory was\nrepeated in the final, though this time Tendulkar's score was 41.\nMeanwhile, back home Tendulkar had been appointed captain of\nMumbai for the 1994-95 Ranji Trophy season, and it turned out to be\na season of triumph for both the team and the captain, culminating in\na century in both innings in the final against Punjab. The first-innings\ncentury was reached in 83 balls, the second from a mere 66---the\nfourth fastest in Ranji history. (The next season he would score the\nfastest century in domestic one-day cricket-from 69 balls for Wills\nXI in the Wills Trophy quarter-final against Hyderabad in Rajkot.) In\nthe five Ranji matches that season (seven innings) he had 856 runs\nwith five centuries at 122. Those 856\nruns were scored from S59 balls with 23 sixes and 106 fours. At 21, Sachin.\nTendulkar had been away inN ew Zealand when Mumbai regained\nthe Ranji Trophy after a gap of ten years in 1994. So, being part of a\nwinning Mumbai team was special for him. Tendulkar scored 116 in the final against Haryana, which\nMumbai won by nine wickets. Apart from 856 runs in the\nRanji Trophy that year, he had struck his first ODI century as well as\ntons against New Zealand at Baroda, West Indies atJaipur and against\nSri Lanka in the Asia Cup in Sharjah. The Wills Trophy saw him\nscore 57 and 116 for Mumbai. He had 285 runs in the Wills World\nSeries, 247 in the Pepsi one-day series against the West Indies and 402\nruns in three Tests against the same team. For Sachin, it was a memorable year: his first 001 century,\nfirst Ranji Trophy triumph, first century against the West Indies, the\nAsia Cup .'\nThere was to be another landmark in Tendulkar's life that year.\n\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n137.", "Mental_And_Physical_1994": "", "Lara_1994": "\nLara is a left-hander.\n'Lara is a wonderful player. When you are playing a good bowler, you have to be\npatient and pick the right ball to hit and Lara does that well.'\nSadly for Lara, the tour ended prematurely, following a dislocated\nelbow during a one-day game (followed by more girlfriend troubles\nback home). In 1997, Lara scored 394 runs\nat 39.87 for Tendulkar); in 1999 Lara's 737 runs\nwere scored at an average of27.88; Lara: 497 at 29.23; and in 2001 Lara had 1151 runs at 63.

No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in 1994.\nA friend warned Lara in 1994 that his troubles were just beginning. At various times Lara has consulted\npsychiatrists in a bid to overcome his demons, and in conversation\nwith former England captain Mike Brearley in 1995, he complained\nof'frustration, and mental and physical tiredness'. The West Indies\nCricket Board reprimanded Lara after several verbal outbursts by him. Lara did get his chance in the Barbados Test\nagainst India in March 1997. But the\u00b7\nWest Indian authorities appeared in no hurry to make Lara's\nappointment a formal one.\nLara led a pay dispute by the team that saw him stripped ofhis captaincy,\nonly to get it back once the matter was resolved. Lara had not scored a century in 13\nTests.\nBut single-handedly, Lara had restored the pride ofWest Indian cricket,\nand his own reputation in the bargain, with his breathtaking batting. Lara lacked the comfort of a\nstable family life, which has benefited Tendulkar so much, and given\nhim much needed peace of mind. Lara's father, who was an early\ninfluence, died before he made his Test debut. Lara did have a daughter\nfrom his girlfriend in 1994, but they have since parted ways.\nWriting in Sportsworld (May 1995), 'Tiger' Pataudi commented:\n'Tendulkar, I reckon is even more talented than Lara, but he is yet to\ndevelop the latter's temperament and so often pleases to tease.

There were a few months between the series and the World\nCup which enabled him to iron out the technical flaws which had\ncrept into his batting.'\nThat innings came in India's opening World Cup tie against Kenya\nat Cuttack; he was 127 not out, at nearly a run a ball. India, needing\n200 to win, coasted to victory with seven wickets to spare after\nTendulkar's opening stand of 163 with Ajay Jadeja. For the first time, the Indian team was being\nseen as a 'one-man army'-uncharitable though this was to\nTendulkar's talented teammates. But it was true that for Indian fans,\nSachin was the main event. Inevitably, the rnatch was seen as a\nTendulkar v Lara clash. Not only did India maintain their\nrecent supremacy over the twice-world champions by winning by\nfive wickets, but Tendulkar also outshone his famed rival. The scores:\nLara-2; Tendulkar-70.

If India v West\nIndies was billed as Tendulkar v Lara, this one was the TendulkarWarnc show. This time Sachin won the individual honours against\nthe leg-spinner. But he was outshone by Mark Waugh and the\nAustralians who won the contest by 16 runs. Waugh's 126\nfollowed on from his 130 against Kenya four days earlier, making him\nthe first batsman to make back-to-back centuries in the World Cup.\nThe contrast between Waugh and Tendulkar could not have been\ngreater. WithJadeja and Kambli sent back for next to nothing, a sense\nof desperation crept into the Indian master's batting. Faced with a\nbig target, Tendulkar decided to chance his arm and play some\naudacious shots. McGrath missed a tough caughtand-bowled chance and was promptly carted for 27 runs from two\novers.\n140\n\nSachin\n\n\fIt was a magnificent spectacle under the lights and the crowd was\nin a frenzy. It seemed only Sachin could save India as he raced to his\n50 from 41 balls. Warne's very first delivery was hit straight and\nhard for six and suddenly Tendulkar was on 90 from 88 balls. Bowling innocuous offbreaks,\nhe saw Tendulkar charge out and bowled wide down the leg side. Ian\nHealy whipped off the bails and the life had gone out of the Indian\nbatting.\nWatching this innings by Tendulkar on TV at home in Adelaide,\nSir Donald Bradman was struck by a sense ofdeja vu. He told his wife\nthat he felt Tendulkar's batting technique was similar to his own. Tendulkar and Azhar were in devastating form,\nplundering 99 runs from the last ten overs. Tendulkar was run out in\nthe last over for a blazing 137, his highest 001 score which took his\naggregate in the World Cup to 424 runs for three times out.

But Kambli's 106 gave the home side victory by 40\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n141\n\n\fruns and this set up an electric encounter with Pakistan in the quarterfinals. Minutes before the\nstart came the dramatic announcement that Pakistan captain Wasim\nAkram had pulled out with an injury and Aamir Sohail would lead\nthe side. Openers Sidhu and Tendulkar\nmade a cautious start and 90 was on the board before the latter dragged\none from Ata-ur-Rehman on to his stumps for 31.

All the top order batsmen got a good\nstart with Sidhu holding the innings together with 93. His 45 from 26 balls helped India to a huge 287\nfor8.

The ball brushed\nTendulkar's pad and he moved out of his crease, looking for a leg bye.\nWorld Cup 1996-and England Again\n\n143\n\n\fThe Indian batting after that defied all reason. Seven wickets went\ndown for 22 runs as one a'fter the other, the batsmen committed harakiri.\nTendulkar finished with the most runs in the tournament: 523\nruns at 87.17 from his seven matches-still the only instance in the\nWorld Cup of a batsman exceeding 500 runs. Kumble\ncaptured the most wickets (and took the most catches, too). Tendulkar's round 100 was his first century\nagainst Pakistan in either form of the game. His 'fault' was the MRF logo on his bat, which\ninfringed the International Cricket Council's (Icc) ruling prohibiting\nlogos of a particular size other than that of the bat manufacturer. This time it was\nIndia's turn to pip Pakistan on net run rate and reach the final against\nSouth Mrica, who made it a debut to remember by winning the match\nby 38 runs. There was, however, the considerable consolation for India\n144\n\nSachin\n\n\fof beating Pakistan in the return match by 28 runs, having lost the\nopening game by 38 runs.\nNot surprisingly, it was Tendulkar who led the charge with his\nsecond century in the last three matches against Pakistan.

Though India were routed by\nnine wickets, Tendulkar marked the day with his ninth 001 ton and\nadded 129 runs for the third wicket with Azhar.\nIn his book Indian Cricket: The Captains-From Nayudu to Tendulkar,\nPartab Ramchand wrote about Tendulkar's first stint in charge:\nReally there can be nothing but praise for the manner in which\nTendulkar conducted himself in his various capacities as\ncaptain. India's failure to gain, very narrowly, a berth in the\nISO\n\nSachin\n\n\ffinal, did not in any way make a dent in his popularity.\nThough his captaincy was praised as positive, Tendulkar's batting fell\naway after he won the Man of the Match award for an unbeaten 89 in\nthe first match, which India won by eight wickets. Ganguly was 11 not out in the\nsecond and when he replaced Kambli in the fifth and final game, he\ncould manage just 12. Tendulkar reacted angrily. He defended his choice ofKambli by saying that he was\nthe best batsman for that wicket, and if Ganguly wasn't upset, why\nshould other people.' (Sportsworld,\nOctober 1996)\nThere would be a one-offTest for the inaugural Border-Gavaskar\nTrophy in New Delhi in October, followed by a three-Test home\nseries against South Mrica.\nThe Australians were weakened by the absence of the injured Shane\nCaptaincy- I\n\n151\n\n\fWarne who no doubt would have licked his lips in anticipation had he\ntaken one look at the Feroze Shah Kotla pitch.\nIt was a new Indian team management that was in charge. Tendulkar\nfailed with the bat (10 and 0) in his first Test as captain. The state of the pitchwhich was to find its way into the CBI report into match-fixing four\nyears later-was defended by the new Indian captain. Tendulkar was in sparkling form and had three half-centuries in\nthe league phase.\nTendulkar's proactive approach while defending the small total must\nhave come as a pleasant surprise to most of the team, as they were used\nto Azhar's low-key approach to captaincy. Tendulkar\nwas more than just active, he was a touch hyperactive, whether in\nadvising bowlers, handling the field placements with elaborate care,\nor even taking advice at on-field meetings.\n152\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut a year later, when the defeats outstripped the wins, the same style\n\nof captaincy was condemned as naive and over the t0p.\nSachin's first full series in charge against the strong SouthMricans\nwas a topsy-turvy affair. His two kno'cks at Kanpur showed a new Sachin to\nthe Indian public. It was a Sachin who eschewed stroke play for\noccupation of the crease, in an echo ofhis mentor Gavaskar's prediction\nin his column.Mohan in the Cricketer International (February 1997), at\nthe end of the series, 'The change at the helm effected during the year\nproved far reaching while also bringing in a twin benefit. Sachin\nTendulkar's captaincy, dynamic in most parts, and Mohammad\nAzharuddin's batting touch, a splendid recreation of all that is good\nabout Indian batsmanship, came about because the switch at the top\nwas made well in time.' Added Mohan, 'The most positive aspect to\nemerge from the series is that a young captain is prepared to play\npositive cricket. He may have hit a\nlow in the negative cricket he made his team play in the second Test in\nCalcutta but he came out of that mindset, in time to go for the series\nwin in Kanpur.\nCaptaincy- I\n\n153\n\n\fThere was just enough time at the end of the tour to squeeze in one\nmore match.\n\n154\n\nSachin\n.", "Happened_1997": "", "Time_1997": "", "Time_2001": "", "Selectors_1997": "\nI was at the CCI that day, when the selectors were picking the\nside to tour the We.

The Indian bowling,\nstill without Srinath, had run out of answers. Indian cricket was at a\npretty low ebb.\nIronically, the first to be axed was not a cricketer, but a journalist.\nBut it turned out to be the one silver lining in the dark clouds that\nhad gathered over Indian cricket.\nAdded to these wickets was Ganguly's total of222 runs, more than\nenough to make him the obvious choice for Man of the Series.\nThe wickets were seamer friendly, and the batsmen struggled in\nthe first four matches.

The\nmedia held a gun to Tendulkar's head and asked him to bat at\nnumber four (interestingly, Desai before the Sri Lanka series\nvehemently denied that the selectors had asked Tendulkar to\nbat lower down, and said that was a media-propagated lie; today,\nRungta confirms that the selectors had indeed done so in a 'last\nditch attempt' to avoid sacking him-so who is lying, here.\nThe media consistently refused to give Tendulkar the team he\nasked for.

Two months after Tendulkar's\nsacking, he resigned on health grounds. But there is no doubt that in 1998 he was back to 'demolishing'\nbowlers.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by 18\nruns in the preliminary game. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. Their top scorer with\n77, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket.\nSachin also held three more catches to round off a sparkling all-round\ndisplay. He had bowling figures of7-0-45-3 and then he\nput the Pakistani bowlers to the sword with 95 runs from 78 balls,\nwith five sixes and six fours. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n192\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance. In the\nsecond final, when he was bowled in the second over by Azhar\nMahmood for 1, the batting folded up for 189 and Pakistan wrapped it\nup easily to take the tournament to the decider.)

At this point, Sachin Tendulkar is doing\nvery well with the bat. And yet, sections of the media carry on\nthe inspired campaign-that Tendulkar is feeling the pressure\nof captaincy, that his batting is falling apart, that India's losses\nare attributable to this factor and this factor alone.\nContrast this with Sachin Tendulkar, who was recently\nappointed 'captain for 27 days. When, both before and after the\nAsia Cup, two selectors have systematically, under the guise of\nanonymity (the heck with the no names policy-the two\nselectors in question are Sambaran Bannerjee and Shivlal\nYadav) spoken to the media about their determination to sack\nTendulkar. We present\nsamples:\n'The reason why the selectors fell back on Azharuddin was\nthat he was the only player, other than Tendulkar, to be a\ncertainty in both forms of the game . Again, wasn't this the same bunch of selectors who,\njust a while ago, spoke of having one captain-Ajay Jadejafor one-dayers and another for Tests. Asked why Tendulkar was sacked,\nRungta on behalf of Desai said that the only criterion was bad\nbatting, and not any perceived defects in the captaincy.\nIf that is the case, then why is Tendulkar not captain of the\nTest side, considering that he is aggregating over 1,000 runs,\nand averaging over 63, in Tests this year-the highest of any of\nthe Indian batsmen. We wanted to make a last ditch effort to\navoid the unpleasant step of axing Tendulkar, so we asked him\nto bat lower down in one dayers. The selectors ask Tendulkar to bat\nlower down.\nIn fact, against Sri Lanka, Azhar is ranked below Tendulkar,\nwho tops with 88, Ganguly (73),Jadeja (60) and Sidhu (53),\nwith 52 runs to his name. If captaincy can have a negative impact on Sachin\nTendulkar, how much more then, by the same logic, could it\nimpact on an already struggling Azharuddin. Samples:\n~I of us have tremendous respect for Tendulkar, and not since\nGavaskar has anyone received so much admiration from all as\nTendulkar has got. The 'problem of captaincy' adversely affects a player\nwhen he is playing one-day cricket, and beneficially when he\nis playing Test cricket.\nMore from Desai: 'The selectors have gone on record\nappreciating Tendulkar's sportsmanship of taking all the blame\non himsel\u00a3 He is the type to carry on the battle. The\nmedia held a gun to Tendulkar's head and asked him to bat at\nnumber four (interestingly, Desai before the Sri Lanka series\nvehemently denied that the selectors had asked Tendulkar to\nbat lower down, and said that was a media-propagated lie; today,\nRungta confirms that the selectors had indeed done so in a 'last\nditch attempt' to avoid sacking him-so who is lying, here.\n'No, we have not officially been informed of Tendulkar's\nresignation . Two months after Tendulkar's\nsacking, he resigned on health grounds. Tendulkar was back to his best in one-day games while\nAzharuddin's added responsibilities appeared to bring out the best in\nhim again. Both the captain and the ex-captain had an outstanding\ntournament and combined to beat the hosts in the opening match.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by 18\nruns in the preliminary game. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. Their top scorer with\n77, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket. Once again,Tendulkar was in\nthe thick of things. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n192\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance.) Ganguly\nwas Man of the Match for his superb 124 while Tendulkar took the\nMan of the Series award.\nTendulkar has pointed out in subsequent interviews how the\ncaptaincy can hinge on decisions like the promotion of Robin Singh\ncoming off or not. And the match referee was a gentleman by the\nname of Mike Denness, the former England captain who would play\na rnajor role in Indian cricket three years later.\nMusical Chairs\n\n193\n\n\fThe new captain had been very particular about it and the selectors\nhad had to acquiesce.\nBefore the series, Tendulkar's preparations consisted ofgettingsome\nlocal leg-spinners to bowl to him on a pitch where the area outside the\nleg stump had deliberately been roughened. Led by Tendulkar,\nthey inflicted a crushing ten-wicket defeat on the Aussies and the\ncaptain's own contribution set the tone for the series. In a decade of\nfirst-class cricket, Tendulkar had not come close to a double century. Tcndulkar was 204 not out, his best in first-class cricket.\nTendulkar reached his first 50 from 46 balls and his century came\nfrom 90 with 15 fours and a six.

Once again, Tendulkar employed the rough-outsidethe-leg-stump tactics at the Chennai nets. All the Warne v Tendulkar hype\nhad obviously got to Sachin. Tendulkar had been too hasty in trying\nto assert his authority over Warne and had paid the price_.\nTendulkar walked to the wicket half an hour into the fourth Jay,\nwith the score on 115 tor 2, after Sidhu had softened up the bowlers\nwith a hard-hitting 64. 'Taking into\naccount the pitch conditions and the fact that he was facing arguably\nthe best wrist spinner of them all, Tendulkar's 199-ball innings was\none of the greatest batting exhibitions of modern times,' wrote OJ\nRutnagur in Wisden Cricket Monthly (May 1998).\nWarne was reduced to desperation by Tendulkar's uncanny\njudgement of the direction and degree of spin from the bowler's hand. All those hours spent\nplaying against the leggies in the 'nets', pitching in the rough, now\npaid off for Tendulkar. But Tendulkar was determined not to allow the\nbowler to gain the upper hand in their absotbing personal duel.\nBatsmen around the world for many years had floundered against the\nleg-spinner pitched on the rough on a turning wicket.\nSo was Sachin's Man of the Match award. This time it was the captain who played\nthe leading hand with the bat. Once again, Tendulkar was in a murderous\nmood and once again Warne was his main target.\nTendulkar carried his form against the Aussies into the Pepsi tri-nation\none-day series, where Zimbabwe joined the two teams.\nThis time Tendulkar won his customary Man of the Match award for\nhis success, not with the bat but with the ball-a first for him. Tendulkar got his first fivewicket haul when Martyn was caught at deep mid-off. Tendulkar's analysis was 10-2-32-5, beating his\nprevious best of 4-34 against the West Indies at Sharjah in 1991.\nNot so surprising was another Tendulkar ton in the Kanpur game\nagainst the hapless Australians, who must have been sick and tired of\nthe sight ofhis broad bat by now.

In return, he was\nasked to introduce the bookie to key players in the side, including\ncaptain Tendulkar. He met Tendulkar for an interview in\nGeorgetown, Guyana, at the end of which he asked the captain for his\nreaction to the bookie's offer. While the BCCI brushed aside the story in public,\nunknown to Magazine himself, a letter was faxed to Tendulkar midway\nthrough the West Indies tour, asking him who the bookie was who\nhad offered him the money.\nHis voice [Tendulkar's] was a mixture ofanger and hurt. 'The Board had taken the \"I\" in your story to be me\n[Tendulkar] ,' he said. In his letter Magazine wrote: 'I fail to understand\nhow Tendulkar's name was linked with the bookie when my story\nwas clear and at no stage did it even hint that the bookie had met\nTendulkar.' He added something to the effect that Tendulkar was not\nonly a great player but also a great ambassador for the country and\nshould be left alone to concentrate on his game.\nBut two points concerning Tendulkar stood out: firstly, Prabhakar\nrefused to trap Tendulkar on video despite pressure from those at the\nweb site; he said he had too much respect for him.\nTendulkar was spared the ordeal. It would be relevant here to quote\npassages from the em report directly concerning Tendulkar, which\nwas released to the media on 1 November 2000.\nSachin Tendulkar (pages 88---89):\nSachin Tendulkar, former Indian captain, when asked about\nthe India-New Zealand Test at Ahmedabad in 1999, stated that\nby the end of third day's play when New Zealand had lost\naround 6 wickets, he had thought to himself that he would\nenforce the follow-on the next day.\nOn being asked about the India-West Indies match at Kanpur\nin 1994 when Manoj Prabhakar and Nayan Mongia batted\nslowly, he stated that he was the vice captain during that match\nand he was absolutely sure that there were no instructions from\nthe management for Manoj Prabhakar and Nayan Mongia to\nbat slowly and that he was so upset with their tactics that he did\nnot talk to them after the match.", "Centuries_1998": " This included one double century, five centuries and t\\vo 50s.

As a result, Mumbai cricket fans\nhad to be content with the India v Australia league match. The Pakistanis would also stay on to play a Test at Kolkata as\npart of the inaugural Asian Test championships and then a triangular\none-day series with India and Sri Lanka. So India-Pakistan cricket was very much the flavour of the\nseason-all this in the run-up to the big event, the World Cup in\n\n\fEngland.\nThe huge strain on the Indian cricketers would continue for\nanother year-since 1996, they had played a phenomenal number of\nmatches. There was some\nfantastic cricket too, to match the victories on the diplomatic front.\nIt was certainly an amazing four days of cricket at the MA\nChidambaram Stadium at Chepauk, Chennai-scene of the second\ntied Test in 1986. India were 48 tor no loss at stumps, with\ndebutant opener S.\nThis time it was the turn ofVcnkatesh Prasad to do the damage\nwith the ball; he claimed six wickets.\nThat India got so close was almost entirely due to Tendulkar and\nhis partnership of136 for the sixth wicket with Nayan Mongia.

Tendulkar revealed a new facet of his supreme\nbatsmanship-the ability to graft for runs and play a long innings.\nThis was just the breach the Pakistanis were looking for and the\nrest of the Indian batting subsided meekly to hand over victory to the\necstatic Pakistanis. Looking on was Raj Singh Dungarpur. 'I saw Gundappa\nVisvanath make an undefeated 97 in a score of 191 at Chepauk against\nthe West Indies (in 1975).

During the last league match against the West Indies\nat Harare on 4 July, when he scored his twenty-ninth ODI century,\nSachin had felt a sharp pain in his foot while setting offfor a single. The 'click' that\nTendulkar had heard was most likely of his tiny toe bone (known as\nthe 'medial sesamoid') snapping. Tendulkar felt there may have been\nmore pressure on the area due to the spike-studded sole ofhis custommade shoes. Initially, it was hoped\nTendulkar would miss only the oms and would be fit in time for the\nTest series.\n'Sachin could have played the Test series only at the risk offurther\ninjury. For a few days, the whole country watched\nas Tendulkar's fractured toe and Prime Minister Vajpayee's worn out\nknee competed for space in the media.\nTendulkar had missed some one-day matches just before and after\nthe 1999 World Cup due to back pain. There was just one Indian\nand one contemporary player among the twelve named and that was\nTendulkar, one of Sir Don's favourites. The young Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag was asked\nto open the innings after Yuvraj Singh and Arnay Khurasiya had failed\nin that position.\nRemarkably similar in height, build and looks, Sehwag also\ndisplayed an array of attacking shots normally the preserve of\nTendulkar, whose batting spot he had taken in his hero's enforced\nabsence. Tendulkar thrilled Schwag by sending a message of\ncongratulations.\nThe 'New Tendulkar', they were already calling him. Sehwag, though,\nwould have none of it.

The\n342\n\nSachin\n\n\faccompanying article raised the question for the first time as to whether\nhe was nearing the end of his career.\nAlthough he had recorded the world Test record hundred six weeks\nearlier in Delhi, Tendulkar looked below his attacking best on the\ntour and the spate of injuries only added to the speculation. Tendulkar played a major role with 100 in the opening game at\nPeshawar which India lost on the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nIndia swept the next four matches and his innings of 95 in the\nthird at Lahore was Tendulkar at his best. There was a magical touch\nto his strokes and the Pakistani bowlers were at his mercy. So the\nresults for the team and his own batting in Pakistan had been decidedly\nmixed.\nThe first Test at N agpur was drawn and then India rolled over the\nvisitors at Mohali to win the second by nine wickets. It was a stunning move which left\nIndian cricket fans fuming and even Tendulkar had to face the wrath\nof his home fans for the first time.\nSet 313 runs in the fourth innings, the batting folded up in one of\nthe direst batting displays on home soil by an Indian side in living\nmemory.\nTendulkar was top scorer with 34 but when he departed at 76 for 5,\nthe boos from a small section of the crowd at the Wankhede Stadium\ncame as a shock to everyone present.\nTendulkar, though, once again had to sit it out with an injury, his\nthird in successive years.\nSachin had a brief stint with the Lashings club side in England in\ncharity matches after surgery to test his fitness.\nHe was back in India colours after a break of five months for the\ntri-series in Sri Lanka in August. Sachin faced just three deliveries in\nthe first match at Colombo before it was abandoned due to rain with\nIndia at 11 for no loss against the hosts.\nAll doubts were put to rest as he smashed five sixes (and 13 fours)\nin a masterly innings of 141 not out against the West Indies.\n344\n\nSachin\n\n\fWhat made it special was that he batted right through the 50 overs for\nonly the second time in 364 matches. We just\nhad to watch it and appreciate it, and it was a very special innings for\nIndia.'\nTendulkar also scored 65 in the return match but flopped in the\ntwo games against Australia (12 and 4), and India failed to reach the\nfinal. Tendulkar contributed just one half-century.\nBut there was a silver lining in the one-off T-20 International at\nJohannesburg which India won by six wickets with a ball to spare.\nIt remains the only Twenty20 International in which Tendulkar\n(he scored 10) has played and though no one could have dreamed of it\nat the time, India would take the cricket world by storm at the same\nvenue less than a year later.\nThe big story on the eve of the Test series was the return of Ganguly\nafter almost a year out of the Indian side. He was one of the batting\nstars in a low-scoring first Test at Johannesburg which India won by\n123 runs.\nTendulkar's patchy form continued into the Test series with only\ntwo half-centuries from six innings.
