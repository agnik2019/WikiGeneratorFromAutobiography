Jawahar\u00ac\nlal \u2014 the name was one which its owner never greatly fancied \u2014 was doted on\nby his parents; and this is not surprising, as Motilal had lost both a wife and\nson, had married again, and had lost another son before Jawaharlal, who re\u00ac\nmaided an only child for eleven years.\nNothing, therefore, was going to be denied to Jawaharlal. Though\nMotilal\u2019s explosive temper frequently mitigated his spoiling of his son, there\nwere no checks on the adulation Jawaharlal received from his mother, Swaruprani Nehru. The atmosphere\nof Hindu custom and folklore was not lacking in the Nehru home, and\nJawaharlal picked up a great deal of legend from the women and indulged in\ntemple-going and Ganga-bathing. But the Nehru family was never fully\nintegrated into the high-caste Hindu society of Allahabad, for not only was\nMotilal a relative newcomer but he had been excommunicated in 1899 for\nhis refusal to make atonement for having travelled overseas.\nThe fortunes of the Nehrus had for generations been tied to Muslim patrons. The use ofthe surname Nehru\ndid not become common till much later,4 and even after.it did, both father and\nson were commonly addressed as Pandit Motilal and Pandit Jawaharlal. Hard\nas he tried, Jawaharlal could nevershake off this prefix which he found distaste\u00ac\nful, and was referred to respectfully by his countrymen as \u2018Panditji\u2019.

He was a bright pupil, though he never graduated,\nand set up legal practice, first inKanpur and then in Allahabad.1 Specializing in these\nbranchesofthe civil law, with many clients among the zamindars and talukdars\nand links doubtless with the Kashmiri Pandits who had infiltrated into the\nlanded estates,2 soon Motilal became one of the leaders of the Allahabad Bar.

Indeed, on hearing of the savage treatment df political prisoners in other jails in the United Provinces, Jawaharlal felt ashamed of the better conditions of his own prison life, and he invited the Government to give him the same treatment as the others.4\nJawaharlalwasconcerned, too, about hiswife and mother roughing it out on their own and his two sisters languishing in jail; but it was the thought of his growing daughter that frequently came strongly to him and filled his mind.\n1 Letter (in Hindi) to Jawaharlal, 16 April 1932. \u2022\n* To the Superintendent, District Jail, Dehra Dun, 11 July 1932.\n\u2019Letter to Indira, New Year's Day 1933, GUmptss, p.\n4 Letter to the Superintendent, District Jail, Dehra Dun, 16 November 1932,\n174 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nJawaharlal was no professional scholar writing within a clearly defined and balanced framework.

The thought that Gandhi might die, and for such a minor reason, and that the onlyremaining protective forcein his life might be removed, knocked Jawaharlal for a time off balance. Gandhi, amid his own travail, sensed this reaction and sent Jawaharlal a reassuring telegram which helped, along with the news of the fast having been broken, to restore Jawaharlal\u2019s stability.\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n177\nThe next year, Gandhi undertook a purificatory fast and again plunged Jawa* harlal, along with millions of his countrymen, into an emotional crisis. The two telegrams Jawaharlal sent in reply indicate his bewilderment and dread of personal loss. However, once the ordeal was over, Jawaharlal was able to see Gandhi with a much clearer vision than at any time before or since. The emphasis on God and faith, the acceptance of the existing social order, the stress on compromise, the reliance on lieutenants who were proclaimed reactionaries \u2014 all these jarred on Jawaharlal, and his love for Gandhi could not conceal from him that he was drifting further and further away from his leader. His mother was seriously ill, the province wasquiet, the Congress, with Gandhi\u2019s assistance, had seemed to have succeeded in tying itself into knots, and Jawaharlal himself was (erroneously) believed bytheGovernment to be in favour ofgiving upcivil disobedience.\n*Diary entry, 18 July 1933.\n178\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\n(in Hailey\u2019s absence, since he was in London) felt it could take the risk of releas\u00ac ing him; and the Government of India approved.1\nJawaharlal\u2019s comment, on emerging from jail, that he attached little impor\u00ac tance to theswadeshi and Harijan movements, the reports of his talks with his colleagues in the U.2 There was certainly little in common between the public attitudes of Jawaharlal and of Gandhi.

Jawaharlal, unlike Gandhi, was encumbered by complex thought, but in the matter of worldly goods he was becoming as much of a political ascetic. Travelling round the country, Jawaharlal was convinced that never, at any rate since 1857, had there been such extraordinary bitterness against the Govern\u00ac ment and such a passionate desire tc be rid of it.\nJawaharlal had till now deliberately ignored thegrowth of the communal evil in Indian politics in the hope that public attention could be diverted from it by emphasis on the positive aspects of the national struggle., 9 November 1933.\n* Interview in The Leader, 21 November 1933; toS.

It was true that Jawaharlal had not carefully probed this issue, and was irritated by the Mahasabha\u2019s criticisms of Gandhi and the Congress and its open wooing of the Government. The Government were as anxious as Jawaharlal to get him back in prison as soon as possible. Gandhi, it was believed, would tour the country, ostensibly to promote his Harijan schemes but really to sow the seed of further activities in regard to civil disobedience, while Jawaharlal, whose socialism had become \u2018redder\u2019, would seek to strengthen peasant support, particularly in the United Provinces, with a programme of expropriation of the landlords. \u2018The one real danger that we have at the present moment in regard to our political future\u2019, reported the Viceroy, \u2018is the fear lest Jawaharlal Nehru should start a\n1 Interview, 29 November, The Bombay Chronicle, 2 December 1933.\n184 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nsecretivepropaganda in the villageson purely socialistic and communistic lines, for this might be a very troublesome thing to deal with.1 The Bengal Government went further, and publicly stated that Jawaharlal was carrying on his revolutionary agitation under the guise of anti-untouchability activities and with the money collected for Harijan work.

Jawaharlal had a radical rather than an ideological mind. It can be argued that Jawaharlal was giving up too easily, that while he had a socialist vision derived from Europe he lacked the stamina to formulate specific programmes suited to India and promote the strenuous work of forming cadres and establishing an organization \u2014 in other words, that he lacked a 'revolutionary perspective\u2019.4 Such criticism is balanced by the fact that, however disappointed with Gandhi and the Con\u00ac gress, Jawaharlal was still certain of their indispensability in the struggle to expel the British; nor could he regard the motley crowd of Marxists, Fabians, Gandhians and orthodox Hindus who led the Congress Socialist Party with anything but \u2018amused contempt\u2019. authorities, however, feared that the Socialist Party, which was the \u2019greatest menace to peace in the rural areas\u2019, had about fifteen centres in the province, very few of which were really active; but they would all receive a tre\u00ac mendous fillip when Jawaharlal came out of jail.

If a successful struggle foe self-aware nessand self-emancipation is the true testofgreatness, thenKamala ranks among the greatest of the Nehrus.3\nThe publication of Jawaharlal\u2019s Autobiography in the spring of 1936, only a few weeks after the death of Kamala, gave the world an inkling of his nature and enabled it to share his sorrow. In this, the first important first-hand account of the modern phase of Asian nationalism, Jawaharlal showed that in India it was a civilized, responsible movement that owed as much to the principles of European revolu\u00ac tion and the liberalism and nonconformity of Britain as to the Indian context.\u2019 Letter to Jawaharlal (in Hindi),\n9 October 1932.\n5See his statement to the press, 17 March 1936; The Discovery ofIndia (Calcutta, 1946), p.\n\u201828 April 1936.\nDeathof kamaia nehru\n1*7\nSo the Autobiography, despite being a long and serious book, became a best\u00ac seller and within weeks ran into many editions \u2014 though unfortunately lor Jawaharlal his publisher.1\nThe book was characteristic of Jawaharlal. Jawaharlal was too undemonstra\u00ac tive, too repelled by any trace of exhibitionism* to interest the world primarily in himself. But what Jawaharlal did set out to tell was of the Indian condition and of British rule, which hurt both his feelings and his intelligence by forcing the large majority of his countrymen to live in sordid and brutal drcumstances. In later years, Jawaharlal often spoke of the Autobiography as having \u2018dated\u2019.\nMoreover, Jawaharlal wrote with detachment.

Though\nMotilal\u2019s explosive temper frequently mitigated his spoiling of his son, there\nwere no checks on the adulation Jawaharlal received from his mother, Swaruprani Nehru. The atmosphere\nof Hindu custom and folklore was not lacking in the Nehru home, and\nJawaharlal picked up a great deal of legend from the women and indulged in\ntemple-going and Ganga-bathing. But the Nehru family was never fully\nintegrated into the high-caste Hindu society of Allahabad, for not only was\nMotilal a relative newcomer but he had been excommunicated in 1899 for\nhis refusal to make atonement for having travelled overseas. Even as late as 1919, there was always a problem about\nthe women of the Nehru household dining together with other Kashmiri\nwomen at weddings and other ceremonies. Motilal himself was, like his ancestors,\nmore fluent in Arabic and Persian and in Urdu than in any other Indian langu\u00ac\nage.\nThe fortunes of the Nehrus had for generations been tied to Muslim patrons.\nThere is no evidence for saying that in the early eighteenth century, Farruksiyar,\nthe Mogul emperor, had invited Raj Kaul to join his court at Delhi. All that we\ndo know is that Raj Kaul came to Delhi, and gradually the Kauls assumed the\ndouble-barrelled name of Kaul-Nehrus, because, it is said, their house was\nsituated on the banks of a canal (nahar in Urdu).3 Then, after the revolt of\n1858, and the final collapse of the Mogul, the Kaul-Nehrus moved to Agra. The use of surnames in India was the result of British influence,\nand it is possible that as the Kaul-Nehrus were drawn into the British adminis\u00ac\ntrative network, they began to use that surname which was less indicative of\ntheir caste origins. The use ofthe surname Nehru\ndid not become common till much later,4 and even after.it did, both father and\nson were commonly addressed as Pandit Motilal and Pandit Jawaharlal.5\nThe Nehrus were one of the many Indian families who took advantage of\nthe conditions and opportunities created by the raj. At Delhi their landed estate\nhad gradually dwindled, and Motilal\u2019s father, Ganga Dhar Nehru, was a minor,\npolice official. \u201d\n*This was Motilal\u2019s theory, to which Jawaharlal gave currency in his Autobiography, but oil the\nother hand, it has to be remembered that there were Nehrus even in Kashmir.\n4As late as 1888 the list of delegates to the Congress session at Allahabad mentions not Motilal\nNehru but \u2019Pandit Motilal, Hindu, Brahmin, Vakil High Court, North West Provinces.\n18 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\ndied in 1861, three months before the birth of Motilal, but the two older\nbrothers, who themselves had taken service directly under the British or in a\nneighbouring Indian state, saw to it that Motilal received a proper education\nin the English language.1 Specializing in these\nbranchesofthe civil law, with many clients among the zamindars and talukdars\nand links doubtless with the Kashmiri Pandits who had infiltrated into the\nlanded estates,2 soon Motilal became one of the leaders of the Allahabad Bar.\nThough Motilal had been born poor, had acquired many responsibilities at\nan early age as head of a large Hindu joint family, and was professionally equip\u00ac\nped rather than generally educated, he had no complexes. Like most members of the educated Indian dlite, he\ntook an interest in politics and dutifully attended as many sessions of the Indian\nNational Congress as he could.\n}See Jawaharlal\u2019s message on the death of Amaranatha Jha, 19 September 1955.\nJawaharlal was not unhappy at Harrow, and when he left after two years,\n1Theosophy in India (1912), p.\n3DrJoseph Wood to Motilal, 19 March 1906, Motilal Nehru papers, Nehru Memorial Museum\nand Library, New Delhi, (hereafter N. \u2022\n20 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\non the last night, he tells us, his pillow was covered with tears.

The Nehru Report had lapsed, but its non-controversial parts were still binding on the Gongress; and Jawaharlal hoped that its role in the fight for freedom would convince all of its bonafides.

Congress, had accepted that the poverty and misery of the Indian people was due not only to foreign exploitation but also to the economic structure of society which required \u2018revolutionary changes\u2019. The first session of the Round Table Conference had made dear that it was futile to discuss Indian problems with anyone except the Congress: \u2018no Indian delegation\u2019, wrote the corres\u00ac pondent in India of The Times, \u2018without a three-quarter line composed of Gandhi on one wing, the two Nehrus in the centre, and Malaviya or Patel on the other, can possibly be looked on as representative.\u20192The Viceroy also came round to the recognition that logically there were only two alternatives: to govern without consent or to make terms with Gandhi.3 On 17 January 1931 theViceroy, in the new, Christian style of imperialism, appealed to Gandhi for co-operation on a basis of mutual trust; and two days later the Prime Mini\u00ac ster, Ramsay MacDonald, offered provincial autonomy, responsibility of the central executive to a federal legislature with some safeguards for minorities during a period of transition, and reforms in the existing constitution pending final decisionon permanentchanges.\n150\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nshould be ignored and the fight carried on; but, in fact, MacDonald\u2019s state\u00ac ment amounted to nothing. The differing attitudes of father and son on many poli\u00ac tical issues, the gradual shift of Motilal to a viewpoint closer to Jawaharlal\u2019s and the many legends woven round his ambitious and spoiling love for his son, cannot detract from the fact that his was the weightier influence. For long after Motilal\u2019s death, Jawaharlal felt the lack of his sheltering wisdom, and doubtless this deprivation did muchto reinforce his dependence on Gandhi.\n*For an analysis of this, see Bipan Chandra, \u2018Elements of Continuity and Change in Early Nationalist Activity*, paper read at the Indian History Congress, December 1972. Nor had Gandhi stood firm on the demands for a general amnesty, an inquiry, into police excesses, which to Jawaharial was preliminary to any participation in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference,4 the return of all immovable property which had been attached, and the unlimited right to collect salt.3\nIt appeared to most members of the Working Committee, and above all to Jawaharial, that Gandhi had been outwitted and, in return for some empty phrases which recognized the indispensability of Congress in any Indian settlement, had yielded on every crucial issue and ignored the long-term objectives.\n2 See his continents to t journalist, 18 February, Tba Tribum, 22 February 1931.' Jawaharial to Vijayalakshmi Pandit, 28 February 1931.\n152\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nHowever, despite his disappointment, at the Congress session at Karachi Jawaharlal moved the resolution ratifying this settlement. It has frequently been suggested that Gandhi secured this by agreeing, in turn,\u2018to a resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal and revised by him, committing the organization to provide in any future constitution for not only the basic civil liberties, adult suffrage and free primary education, but also \u2018real economic freedom\u2019. On the other hand, much ofGandhi\u2019seleven pointsof 1930was included \u2014 reduction of civil and military expenditure, exclusion of foreign cloth and yam, prohibition, abolition of the salt tax and lowering of the exchange ratio of the rupee.1 Jawaharlal too was aware that this resolution did not go even as far as his earlier efforts, from 1928 onwards, at drafting an economic programme which would have some meaning for the peasants and workers of India.

Jawahar\u00ac\nlal \u2014 the name was one which its owner never greatly fancied \u2014 was doted on\nby his parents; and this is not surprising, as Motilal had lost both a wife and\nson, had married again, and had lost another son before Jawaharlal, who re\u00ac\nmaided an only child for eleven years.\nNothing, therefore, was going to be denied to Jawaharlal.Jawahkrlal heard innumerable stories of heroism and tragedy of the\nyears of the revolt. \u201d\n*This was Motilal\u2019s theory, to which Jawaharlal gave currency in his Autobiography, but oil the\nother hand, it has to be remembered that there were Nehrus even in Kashmir.

In his adult years Jawaharlal was very conscious of his Harrovian con\u00ac\nnexions.\nJawaharlal\u2019s arrival at Harrow coincided with startling events in India and\noutside, and it was now that he began, for the first time, to take an interest in\npolitics and world affairs.\u20191 Jawaharlal was avid for news, and asked his\nfather to mail Indian newspapers \u2014\u2018not The Pioneer'2\u2014 to him regularly\nMotilal\u2019s own enthusiasm was short-lived, and soon he was denouncing the\nmovement against partition as the most srupid and dishonest thing he had ever\nseen;3 but Jawaharlal was not shaken.\nHowever, it was not only developments in India that excited Jawaharlal\u2019s\ninterest.\n2 Letter to Jawaharlal. i January 1906. Jawaharlal was willing to be convinced. Jawaharlal\ndid not plunge intoche student politics of Cambridge. As for the other undergraduate societies, Jawaharial was a member of the\nMajlis, the society of Indian students which he joined despite his father\u2019s dis\u00ac\napproval.1 Palme\nDutt, a schoolboy in those days, remembers Jawaharial occasionally attending\nthe meetings of the Majlis which used to be held in his father\u2019s house, but the\nimpression thatJawaharial had left on him was that of being an aesthetic rather\nthan a political type. In fact, it was Motilal who, early in\n1910, abandoned the idea of Jawaharial sitting for the I.1\nThe impression Jawaharlal gives as an undergraduate is of a man only halfawakened and waiting for further experience and comprehension. But Jawaharlal was, as we know, interested in William Morris, and\nbought a full set of the collected works, which began to be issued from 1910. The life of Morris was the story of the evolution of a revo\u00ac\nlutionary, the progress from aestheticism to the basic question of class power;\nand Jawaharlal may have been, in his own context, moving in the same direc\u00ac\ntion. *\n6Autobiography (Indian edition, 1962), p. This\nwas an achievement well below the level of his talent, but Jawaharlal was not\nby temperament an academic,^and appears to have done very little work.\nOutside the laboratories and lecture rooms, Jawaharlal led a busy life, even\nif it was unspectacular.\nJawaharlal had .\n26 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nMotilal was confident of Jawaharlal\u2019s success; \u2018if my knowledge of human\nnature does not deceive me I think he is bound to rise in his father\u2019s profession.\u20191\nMotilal felt that he himself had but five or six years' work left in him, but in\nthat period he intended to merge his own professional existence in that of\nJawaharlal, have no clients of his own but pass them on to his son and place\nJawaharlal well on the road to success. He would much rather, wrote Jawaharlal, risk\nhis success at the Bar than go through life as a mere lawyer with no interest\nin anything save the technicalities and trivialities of law.\nHowever, as usual, Jawaharlal gave way to his father's wishes and moved\nto London. But Jawaharlal\nwas always a man of physical courage, and proximity to death pleased rather\nthan sobered him.\nFor the next two years Jawaharlal was caught up in the whirl of London\nlife. Never over\u00ac\nloaded with money, Jawaharlal now found himself often in debt, was forced\nto pawn his watch and chain, sometimes had no money even for bus or tube\nfare, and more and more frequently approached his father for supplementary\n1 Motilal to his brother 30 January 1910.\n* Motilal to Jawaharlal, 1 September 1910 and 6 January 1911.\n5 Modlal to Jawaharlal, 13 October 1910. The fact was that Jawaharlal\nwasspendingmuch but enjoying himself little. In his Autobiography Jawaharlal described himself at that time,\na young man of 23, as \u2018a bit of a prig with little to commend me\u2019 ,4It was a\nharsh self-judgment. Jawaharlal had done all the things he had been told to do, but with no\ngreat enthusiasm.\n1Motilal to Jawaharlal, 15 June 1911.

Can there be any doubt as to who represents the soul of India today. But by then, feared Jawaharlal, once again reflecting an unqualifiedly Gandhian viewpoint, India, instead of being a shining example to the rest of the world, might have become but a cheap and inefficient replica of the countries of the West. \u2018Let us take the longer view from now and try to avoid this, and build up a great and strong India worthy of the great leader whom God has blessed us with.

Even the Commissioner was compelled to record reluctantly his impression that \u2018the improvement in the administration was largely due to the chairman, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and a few public spirited members of the Board. Government at the time of Jawaharlal\u2019s relinquishment of the chairmanship is also worth mention. \u2018Pandit Kapildeo Malaviya\u2019, they wrote in April 1925, \u2018was elected chairman of the Allahabad Municipal Board by (a majority of) two votes, in succession to Jawaharlal Nehru, who strove to show that a swarajist could be an administrator and a gentleman, and the Commissioner thinks that the newcomer\u2019s position will be very difficult.\u20192\n1 The Tribune, 24 August 1924. 1925, File 112.", "Jawaharlal_Nehru_1929": "\nHowever, Jawaharlal, his wife and daughter came back ahead and reached Madras in time for the Congress session in December 1927.\nEven more important to Jawaharlal than the political and economic im\u00ac plications of independence were the psychological consequences of a com\u00ac mitment to such an uncompromising policy.

The issue came up again at the All-Parties Conference and at the proceedings of the committee set up by it, with Motilal Nehru as the chairman, to draw up a constitution for India as an answer to the challenge of the Secretary of State, Lord Birkenhead, that Indian politicians were capable of no constructive suggestions.

Yet the jittery Government of India asked the Bombay Government to consider prosecution, and were brought back tp reality only by that Govern\u00ac ment\u2019s comment that everyone must agree with much of what Jawaharlal had said, and it would be difficult to prove that communism and revolution, and not merely socialism, were being advocated.\nThe hope of Motilal at Calcutta was to secure the adoption by the Congress of the Nehru Report and the acceptance of Dominion Status without prejudice to the ultimate goal of complete independence.

He, of course, preferred Dominion Status to independence, but he was not enamoured of the Nehru Report. So Gandhi recommended that if the Government did not accept and act upon the Nehru Report within two years, the Congress should revert to full independence. Such flexibility of approach involved no long-term compromise on ideals and, especially as no one seriously expected the Government to accept the Nehru Report, made a concession only to the ear.\n\u2019Speech 27 December 1928.\n122\nJAWAHARLAt NEHRU\nline in pursuance of his path.1\nFOUR\nSo the Congress gave its support to the Nehru Report and the demand fir Dominion Status for one year, after which it would again resort to non-co- operation as the means for securing independence.

Far from preparing for a struggle for independence, or even from insisting on a full acceptance of the Nehru Report, it was, under Gandhi\u2019s guidance, thinking in terms of negotiations with the British Government without the latter making any precise commitments beforehand.

But a solution based on thegenius of the Indian people and on India\u2019s thought and culture had to be found if the political and social structure was to have any stability and the discords between the various com\u00ac munities were to disappear. The answer to the Calcutta resolution had been clear and definite. Only by the greatest stretch of imaginatidh could the Viceroy\u2019s statement be interpreted as a possible response, but he and others like him had signed the Delhi manifesto because even an outside chance of honourable peace had to be taken before launching on a national struggle.\nThe controversy about the relative merits of independence and Dominion Status was to Jawaharlal really a question about the conquest of power, and he did not think that any form of Dominion Status applicable to India would trans\u00ac fer real power.\nOn the two particular problems of India, the minorities and the states, Jawaharlal had little that was startlingly new to say. The basic idea of non-co-operation must remain, but\n136\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nJawaharlaJ did not think it wise to declare a boycott of schools and law courts at the very start.

Though\nMotilal\u2019s explosive temper frequently mitigated his spoiling of his son, there\nwere no checks on the adulation Jawaharlal received from his mother, Swaruprani Nehru. The atmosphere\nof Hindu custom and folklore was not lacking in the Nehru home, and\nJawaharlal picked up a great deal of legend from the women and indulged in\ntemple-going and Ganga-bathing. But the Nehru family was never fully\nintegrated into the high-caste Hindu society of Allahabad, for not only was\nMotilal a relative newcomer but he had been excommunicated in 1899 for\nhis refusal to make atonement for having travelled overseas. Even as late as 1919, there was always a problem about\nthe women of the Nehru household dining together with other Kashmiri\nwomen at weddings and other ceremonies.\nThe fortunes of the Nehrus had for generations been tied to Muslim patrons. All that we\ndo know is that Raj Kaul came to Delhi, and gradually the Kauls assumed the\ndouble-barrelled name of Kaul-Nehrus, because, it is said, their house was\nsituated on the banks of a canal (nahar in Urdu).3 Then, after the revolt of\n1858, and the final collapse of the Mogul, the Kaul-Nehrus moved to Agra. The use of surnames in India was the result of British influence,\nand it is possible that as the Kaul-Nehrus were drawn into the British adminis\u00ac\ntrative network, they began to use that surname which was less indicative of\ntheir caste origins. The use ofthe surname Nehru\ndid not become common till much later,4 and even after.5\nThe Nehrus were one of the many Indian families who took advantage of\nthe conditions and opportunities created by the raj.

Jawaharlal was so excited by the situation in which he found himself, so much in love with sacrifice and hardship, so self-conscious about the immediate context that he gave no thought to the way or the goal.4\nThe Leader went on to hope that Jawaharlal would abandon the policy of useless sacrifice and suicidal courses in favour of political action. What it seems to have had in mind was that Jawaharlal should join the Moderates and help in the functioning of dyarchy.\n1 Report of interview in October, reprinted in Tbt Bombay CbronicU, 26 December 1922.\n*31 January 1923. He wrote to Motilal three days before Jawaharlal\u2019s release that he wished to establish friendly relations with the latter \u2018and I honestly think I could make life happier for him if he would let me try\u2019.2\nIt seems astounding that this could even be thought of, and is of interest only as showing how, despite his two terms in jail, Jawaharlal was generally thought of, at least in his home province, as basically a moderate nationalist. It was true that Jawaharlal was fay no means a revolutionary extremist, but he was not an incipient loyalist and the career of a man like Surendranath Ban\u00ac nerjee, whohad left the Congress to become a leading-Moderate and a minister in Bengal, was not likely to be his model. Reading was shrewder in his assessment of Jawaharlal as \u2018fanatical in his hostility to Government\u2019. Mean to Motilal, 28 January 1923.1\nThe predicament of Jawaharlal was that, while he was emotionally attached to the leaders of the Swaraj Party, his mind was inclined to agree with those opposed to entering the Councils.'9\nJawaharlal. 2, 1922-1923 (Bomb** 1939), pp. JSpeech at Allahabad, 1 February 1923, reported in Tbo Loador, 4 February 1923. \u2019jawaharlaTs telegram to \u2018Swanjya\u2019, Madras, Tbo Bombay Chroniclo, 24 February 1923.

The movement was of special interest to Jawaharlal, for he attached importance to discipline, and was impressed by the organization of the Akali Dal, which maintained order among its recruits and provided for the upkeep of the families of those injured or arrested.1 And in September, when in Delhi for the special Congress session, Jawaharlal heard that Sikh jathas were daily proceeding to Nabha state, the deposition of whose maharaja in July for mal\u00ac administration was strongly resented by the Sikhs; and he decided to go there to see for himself the Akalis in action.\nOn the night of the 19th September, Jawaharlal, with two companions, Gidwani and Santanam, left Delhi for Muktesar, an Akali centre, and after ad\u00ac dressing a meeting there on the 20th, commending the Akali struggle,2 he entered Nabha state on the morning of the 21st, along with a Sikhjatha, at Jaito. Wilson Johnston, the British official who was serving as the administrator of the state, on hearing that Jawaharlal had set out for Nabha, had obtained the permission of the Viceroy and the Home Member to serve an order on Jawaharlal at the frontier of Nabha state forbidding him to enter the state for two months;3 but he had not anti\u00ac cipated that Jawaharlal would come by road on horseback. The result was that Jawaharlal was well within the state before the order was served on him not to enter Nabha on the ground that he and some of his companions were members of the AICC and their presence was likely to lead to a disturbance of the peace. Jawaharlal replied that he had already entered Nabha and could not vanish into thin air, but that he had no intention of leaving the state; and he and his two friends, on whom an oral order had been served, sat down in a rest-house near by. Their trial was held in camera by a\n1 Report of Jawaharlal\u2019s speech in The Tribune, 4 July 1923. 1924, File I.\n\u00bb 24 September 1923. Thelatterhad by now realized that, even in Nabha, Jawaharlal could not be convicted for entering the state before he had been prohibited from doing so, and decided to alter the charge to one of being in the company of an Akalijatha and therefore of being a member of an unlawful assembly.\u2019\nAs soon as Motilal heard of his son\u2019s arrest he left for Nabha and informed the Viceroy that his sole object was to see Jawaharlal. a25 September 1923.\niThe Bombay Cbropiete, 24 September 1923.\n\u2019ToReading, 20March and 26 June 1924.\n6The Bombay Chronicla, 27 September 1923.

When a young man came to him in search of national work, the only possible activity Jawaharlal could think of was khaddar work.5\nIt is surprising that Jawaharlal did not think of utilizing the services of such young men for promoting communal harmony.6 But Jawaharlal seems to have been too dispirited to act on this suggestion.\n219 September 1924.\n* Tha Leader, 6 November 1924.\n4To Syed Mahmud, 3 February 1923.\n\u2019 Seehis letter to Shankarlal Banker, 28July 1923. 60/1923, Part II.\n6Letter to Jawaharlal, 12 November 1924.\nThis letter like the former is meant to be a plea for Jawaharlal.

Jawaharlal was too undemonstra\u00ac tive, too repelled by any trace of exhibitionism* to interest the world primarily in himself. But what Jawaharlal did set out to tell was of the Indian condition and of British rule, which hurt both his feelings and his intelligence by forcing the large majority of his countrymen to live in sordid and brutal drcumstances. In later years, Jawaharlal often spoke of the Autobiography as having \u2018dated\u2019.\nMoreover, Jawaharlal wrote with detachment. *\nJawaharlal was not strong in analytic thought and the book provides no pro\u00ac found ideas or philosophy.

What impressed Jawaharlal was the personal friendliness1 as well as the general boredom over the Indian question. I felt, as everybody who has ever met him must feel, that Jawaharlal is a Presence and in an immeasurable degree much more than a politician.2\nThe modesty of Jawaharlal, his lack of bitterness and his commitment to ideals, the sadness of mien born of imminent sorrow and past suffering, the difficulty he- experienced in even articulating his speeches after nearly four years in jail, the dazzlement by the light after long darkness, madea deep impact.\u2019 But Jawaharlal knew that smiles, good humour and personal approval did not carry far. The secretary of the club objected to Jawaharlal appearing in the public dining room. See Jawaharlal\u2019s note to Secretary-Generfl, Ministry of External Affairs, 29 May 1994, Nehru papers.\n202\nJAWAHARLAt NEHRU\nthere was a congenital aloofness about him, I had no difficulty in talking to him.*\nThe most lasting impression on Jawaharlal was made not by any Englishman but by Krishna Menon, whom he then met for the first time.

In 1931 Jawaharlal, \u2018a candidate well placed for becoming the Indian Kerensky\u2019,1 had been expelled from the League against Imperialism.3\nThe details of what the communists hoped for from Jawaharlal in India can be discerned in an article by Palme Dutt and Bradley.\n4Palme Dutt andBradley, TheAnti-Imperialist People\u2019s Front in India\u2019, LabourMoMbly, March 1936. There is corroborative evidence of this overwhelmingly emotional mood of Jawaharlal at this time.9\nNow the Congress awaited Jawaharlal\u2019s guidance.\n* Seehis letters to Lord Lothian, 9 December 1935and 17 January 1936.\n*Mahatma Gandhi, 20 January 1936.\n\u2022To Jawaharlal, 22 September 1935.4\nHowever, it soon became clear that the socialists had overestimated both Jawaharlal\u2019s influence as president and his commitment to them.6 Jawaharlal clutched at the avoidance of a decision in his own mind and in the party. Jawaharlal could, in the future, use the office of president to\n1 Resolutions to be placed before the Lucknow Congress, The Bombay Chronicle, 26 March and 8 April 1936. * TheBombay Chronicle, 11 and 14 April 1936. Jawaharlal did not face up to the fact that electoral success and the opportunity of forming ministries would in themselves further weaken the position of those in the party of his way of thinking.\nIn his presidential address Jawaharlal, as was now to be expected of him, analysed the world situation and India\u2019s place in it. All this only steeled Jawaharlal to a greater resolve to end this infamy and to have nothing to do with those willing to compromise with such a rule.\nThe address had been written on 31 March, when Jawaharlal had not known for certain the strength of feeling in the party in favour of office acceptance. The speech, as a whole, mirrored the contradictions in Jawaharlal\u2019s outlook and the weaknesses of his political posi\u00ac tion. Socialism was to Jawaharlal more a tendency than a definable body of doctrine.\u2019 There was much that had happened in the Soviet Union which pained Jawaharlal greatly and he avoided the word com\u00ac munism because in the general understanding it signified Soviet Russia.\nIt is true that Jawaharlal advocated the two chief proposals now being com\u00ac mended by the communists \u2014 the formation of a joint anti-imperialist front, and the affiliation to the Congress of trade and peasant unions.1 Jawaharlal\u2019s general indifference to communal issues and his belief that they would be submerged once the emphasis was shifted to economic matters affecting the common people enabled him to ignore the communal tinge in organizations which were otherwise opposed to the British and were prepared to join him in the campaign for civil liberties. Jawaharlal\u2019s speech was heart-warming, and his personal standing in the party and the country was second only to that of Gandhi. Jawaharlalji seems to be like a typical English,democrat who takes defeat in a sporting spirit. He would strain every nerve to avoid a class war; so perhaps would Jawaharlal but he did not think it possible to avoid it.\n\u2019 The Bombay Chronicle, 16 April 1936.\n4 To Purushottamdas Thakurdag, 20 April 1936.* Jawaharlal thought it vulgar and inappro\u00ac priate to thrust his views, however deeply held, on a party in which he and his followers were in a minority, and created for himself what was in many ways the role of an ineffective president. In the months that followed, while Jawaharlal toured the country addressing scores of meetings and \u2018simultaneously carrying on war at various fronts\u2019,3 the authorities, regarding him as \u2018a potential danger of the first magnitude\u2019,4 followed him round with their notebooks seeking carefully but in vain for any statement that would justify his arrest and ensure a long sentence. 19 August 1936, Home Dept.3 Jawaharlal\u2019s reply was vigorous.1\nThe more intelligent among the businessmen realized that to promote a public debate with Jawaharlal was to invite humiliation.\u20192 It would be obviously far more effective to strengthen the opposition to Jawaharlal within the Con\u00ac gress. Jawaharlal had been unfair to the Indian capitalist class in castigating them as allies of the British imperialists. Patel, Rajendra Prasad and Rajagopalachari objected as strongly to Jawaharlal\u2019s speeches in Bombay as any of the capitalists,4 and appealed to the grand master Gandhi, who called on Jawaharlal for an explanation.\n1 Speechesand interviews, The Bombay Chronicle, 19,20,21 and 23 May 1936.\n4 See Vallabhbhai Patel to Rajendra Prasad, 29 May 1936, Maharashtra Govt, records\u2014inter\u00ac cepted letters.\n\u2019 Jawaharlal toGandhi, 25 May and Gandhi to Jawaharlal, 29 May 1936.\u2019 Jawaharlal should therefore cease wrangling and the 'tragi-comedy\u2019 hewas playing and not destroy himself by moving openly into opposition.

By now Jawaharlal was as indispensable to the Congress as the party was to him. Had Jawaharlal, therefore, insisted in the summer of 1936 on resigning the presidency, it is difficult to believe that Gandhi and his followers would have been short\u00ac sighted enough to let him do so. But it was not just that it did not lie in Jawaharlal\u2019s nature to precipitate such a conflict and to safeguard his political chastity at the price of weakening the nationalist organization. Jawaharlal knew that there was no working-class leader\u00ac ship or even an alternative elite leadership available; and so long as this was the case, it would be disastrous to weaken the Congress.\nMeantime, as the mimic war of the elections drew nearer, Jawaharlal gave it increasing attention. Jawaharlal excluded any reflec\u00ac tion in the manifesto of socialist doctrine.2\nJawaharlal\u2019s right-wing colleagues were naturally elated. I cannot speak too highly of Jawaharlal.3\n%\nWhether, as claimed, Jawaharlal was equally satisfied is doubtful.\n*Tbe Tribune, 23 August 1936.\n4 The Bombay Chronicle, 26January 1937.

He received Jawaharlal at Government House and drove with him to a canteen for Indian soldiers, where Jawaharlal had his first encounter, a startling and unexpected one, with Lady Mountbatten. It has been suggested that Jawaharlal was so bewitched by Mountbatten on his first meeting that he abandoned his principles and his integrity and did not lay a wreath at the memorial.2 In fact, Jawaharlal did not agree with Mountbatten thattheChinesewould be annoyed by any tribute he paid to the I.3 The only concession Jawaharlal made to Mountbatten was to avoid a public function.\nMountbatten\u2019sother requestwas that when Jawaharlal addressed the I. 1Mountbatten, RafUctions on tbo Transfer ofPowar and Jawaharlal Nabru (Cambridge, 1968), p. 4 Jawaharlal's report toPresidentAiCConviajt to Malaya, 28Marcb 1946.

As the years passed, Jawaharlal realized that Gandhi had no use for systematic thinking on economic problems and that, while he had secured a hold on the masses by living and working among them and being ab\u00ac sorbed by them, he made no effort to inspire and rouse then^on anything other than political and social reform movements. But still he clung to Gandhi; and this one-to-one relationship, in which Gandhi specialized, was based on the call to battle with alien rule which Gandhi gave.\nJawaharlal\u2019s first direct dash with the Government, however, came about in an entirely fortuitousway and had nothing to do with Gandhi. 14 November 1920.

Jawaharlal had not been enamoured of the eleven points earlier put forward by Gandhi.3 But law-breaking was invigorating in itself, and his support for Gandhi now was without any mental reservation.\u20194 Gandhi\u2019s march to the sea at Dandi, with a small group of tough and disciplined men and women, has a high place, as fact and as legend, in the history of the Indian freedom movement and, indeed, of freedom in the world. The challenge gripped the imagination in India and beyond, and the refusal of Irwin\u2019s Government to arrest Gandhi in the belief that the march would evoke no response showed how little they were aware of the true situation. Thousands lined the route, large meetings were held at every halting-place, and many village and district officials resigned, while the rest of India was enthralled by every detail of Gandhi\u2019s progress. Jawaharlal with a few friends went down to Gujarat and marched with Gandhi for one stage, and the impression left on him was profound and permanent.

Armed with some general platitudes from the Viceroy, they saw Gandhi in Yeravda jail and found him in what they felt to be a co-operative mood.

Though Jawaharlal had not been very keen, Motilal had said that they had no objection,2 and a special train sped them across the country to see Gandhi.3\nBut the talks of Gandhi and the Nehrus with Sapru and Jayakar came to nothing. What, indeed, struck the Secretary of State was \u2018Gandhi's deference to Jawaharlal and Jawa- harlal\u2019s pride in what had been achieved as well as his declaration of belief in non-violence.8 \u202228 July 1930.\n*Sapru to Jayakar, 8 August 1930, Sapru papers J 16.

Gandhi was unwilling to reject the Government\u2019s overtures out of hand both because he sensed a kindred spirit in the Viceroy, and because he believed that the war-weariness was more widespread than Jawaharlal was willing to recognize.\nJust at this moment, however, Gandhi\u2019s ways were wholly alien to him.\n*For an analysis of this, see Bipan Chandra, \u2018Elements of Continuity and Change in Early Nationalist Activity*, paper read at the Indian History Congress, December 1972. Gandhi had agreed to discontinue civil disobedience in return for a partial amnesty limited to those not charged with violence, and permission to picket peacefully and to manufacture salf under certain con\u00ac ditions; and he committed Congress to take part in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference to consider a scheme of federation and responsibility with safe\u00ac guards 'in the interests of India* for such matters as defence, external affairs, the position of minorities, financial credit and the discharge of obligations. Nor had Gandhi stood firm on the demands for a general amnesty, an inquiry, into police excesses, which to Jawaharial was preliminary to any participation in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference,4 the return of all immovable property which had been attached, and the unlimited right to collect salt.3\nIt appeared to most members of the Working Committee, and above all to Jawaharial, that Gandhi had been outwitted and, in return for some empty phrases which recognized the indispensability of Congress in any Indian settlement, had yielded on every crucial issue and ignored the long-term objectives. But Gandhi threatened to retire if his settlement were repudiated and demanded personal loyalty even if not approval.\n2 See his continents to t journalist, 18 February, Tba Tribum, 22 February 1931.' Jawaharial to Vijayalakshmi Pandit, 28 February 1931. It has frequently been suggested that Gandhi secured this by agreeing, in turn,\u2018to a resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal and revised by him, committing the organization to provide in any future constitution for not only the basic civil liberties, adult suffrage and free primary education, but also \u2018real economic freedom\u2019. Haitbcox, Communism and Nationalism in India (Princeton, 1971), pp.\n2To Onkar Nath Verma, 2 December 1933. Once the settlement had been reached, Jawaharlal, \u2018lonely and almost uninterested\u2019 as Gandhi described him,1 in\u00ac formed his colleagues that he was unable to accept or reconcile himself to the references to safeguards and reservations.3 No permanent damage had been done to Indian nationalism. Gandhi had not broken, but only ignored, the logic of the struggle for freedom; that struggle, in fact, could only end with the attainment of independence. Till then, in the period of neither peace nor war, it was Jawaharlal\u2019s duty to keep the spirit of battle alive, to respect the cohesion of the party and to abide by the leadership of Gandhi. The fears of the Brftish Government4 that he might split with Gandhi and cariy on civil disobedience on his own showed how little they knew him.3\n\u2018See Gandhi\u2019s handwritten note to Jawaharlal, AICC File G 6(KWXi) 1931.\n\u2019To Anjani Kumar, 21 July 1931.", "Gandhi_1931": "Agrarian Crisis\nin the United Provinces\nJawaharlal\u2019s speeches, immediately after the announcement of the settlement, were, somewhat to Gandhi's embarrassment,1 bellicose.

Emerson reported that Gandhi fully accepted the position that it was wrong to refer to the settlement as a truce* to talk about a future war, to refer to Government as an enemy and to exploit the settlement as a victory for Congress.\u20192 Gandhi, in fact, was frightened by the officials with the bogy of a class war being let loose by Jawaharlal.4\nJawaharlal\u2019s health at this time being on the verge of collapse, he had to take a holiday, and while he was in Sri Lanka and southern India, Gandhi was in chargeofthe U.

Where the kisan sabha movement had spread, the authority of the talukdars had crumbled at a stroke; and very few of them did anything else but shut themselves up in their houses or leave for the nearest town. The kisans had to a large extent lost all fear of the police, and the efforts of the Con\u00ac gress had succeeded to the extent that the kisans were now prepared to defy not just the landlords but even the Government. The strengthening of the moderate Congress influ\u00ac ence was part of the same policy as marching troops through the district; they were both intended to keep the kisans from passing wholly under the influence of the extremist agitators. *\nThe arrest of these agitators cleared the way for the strengthening of Cong\u00ac ress influence over the kisans.1 Motilal Nehru drafted a leaflet for distribution to the kisans, urging them to join the Congress, take up spinning, settle disputes in their own pancbayats and not in the law courts, subscribe to the swaraj fund and promote caste and communal harmony. \u2018But above all it is most necessary that all kisans should follow the path of righteousness, should speak the truth, should not indulge in any looting and should refrain from every violence in word and deed, and should commit no excesses of any kind. The harsh action was clearly meant to proclaim that the Government had recovered their nerve, and intended no longer to tolerate intervention by Congressmen in kisan affairs.3\nThe failure to be arrested, at a time when his followers were receiving savage sentences for carrying out his orders, acutely embarrassed Jawaharlal; and his predicament was not lessened by Gandhi\u2019s article in Young India dis\u00ac approving of any radical demands by the kisans.\n1 \u2018Kisanon ka santUsa \\ English translation in Tb\u00bb huUp\u00bbnd\u00bbnt, 3 May 1921.\nAMONG THE PEASANTS 37\nkisan movement must be confined to the improvement of the status of the kisanf and the betterment of the relations between the zamindar and them.2 In November 1921, the AICC permitted full civil dis\u00ac obedience including non-payment of taxes (but not of rents); and though the Congress had little to do with the Eka Movement in Hardoi, Sitapur and Lucknow, which was a revival of kisan agitation in a new form, the Eka asso\u00ac ciations soon began to pass political resolutions.\n>18 May 1921.

Branches of the Kisan Sabha were set up in many villages and tehsils (revenue sub-divisions) and attempts were made to establish similar organizations in other provinces and link them up with the National Congress. Kisan Sabha submitted a draft resolution which was surprisingly radical, urging the Government, among other things, to declare peasants all over India to be actual owners of the soil they cultivated; but the Congress did no more than direct the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) to investigate the various revenue systems and the condition of the peasantry.

Keane, 26November 1920.1\nJawaharlal now gave publicity to the grievances of the kisans, objecting even to donations to the proposed University of Lucknow by estates under the management of the Court of Wards.3 They encouraged the peasants to organize themselves into village kisan sabhas and to formulate their demands for re\u00ac strictions on evictions and forced labour, leases for fourteen years, payment of cesses at only customary rates, cessation of fines and free access to landlords \u2014 demands which could hardly be regarded as extreme.'1 What, in fact, Jawaharlai hoped for was to link kisan discontent with nationalist politics. At a meeting held in Pratabgarh in October to federate the numerous village sabhas into an Oudh Kisan Sabba, the objectives were defined, in a harmless enough manner, as being to improve the condition of the tenantry,,to promote amity between khans and zamindars, to do everything to advance the cause of the country and to establishpanchayats for the settlement of all disputes between tenants. The Deputy Commissioner attended the meeting;* but was obliged to walk out when Jawaharlai advised his kisan audience to boycott elections to the Coun\u00ac cils and stressed that the only moral to be drawn from the Punjab and Khilafat events was that the Government was an utterly unjust one which cased little for the lives, honour and even the religion of the Indian people.2 But this effort to associate the kisan sabhas with the Congress programme led to a split in the parent U.

Gvil disobedience should be begun only when it became inevitable because of some aggressive action by the Govern\u00ac ment, and the people were strong and prepared for struggle. There was a shift in emphasis, in the resolution of 1 March of the Working Committee, from the importance of preparing for civil disobedience to the inevitability of such action as soon as organization permitted or circumstances demanded it.2 The option of restricted or mass civil disobedience, suggested by Jawaharlal, was also deleted by the Committee; and to dispel suggestions that the Congress was prepared to compromise, the Committee reaffirmed that nothing short of complete independence \u2014 not even Dominion Status \u2014 and a constituent assembly would be acceptable. He dare not, he said, start civil disobedience, because if he did, disobedience would remain and civil would disappear. Patel agreed but suggested individual civil disobedience to avoid demora\u00ac lization, and Gandhi was willing to consider this either on a large scale or restricted to a few or confined only to him. Nothing more seemed to be required than preparations to deal firmly and promptly with any form of civil disobedience.3 But Jawaharlal opposed an amendment that civil dis\u00ac obedience should be started immediately on the ground that it was not worthy of the Congress to take advantage of Britain\u2019s difficulties.\n<22 May 1940.\n*ToLinlithgow, 30May 1940, Linlithgow papers, I. 2Quatorze Julllet\u2019, articlepublished in NationalHerald, 16 July 1940.', articles in Notional Harold, 17 and 18 July 1940.2\nThe Congress had, therefore, been pushed back into the mood of civil dis\u00ac obedience.

Again in need of some issue to occupy him, Jawaharlal went to Nabha for a first-hand view of the Akali agitation. 2 Interview in Aaj, 19 June 1923.\n74\nIN NABHA JAIL 75\nbecome Sikhs.1 And in September, when in Delhi for the special Congress session, Jawaharlal heard that Sikh jathas were daily proceeding to Nabha state, the deposition of whose maharaja in July for mal\u00ac administration was strongly resented by the Sikhs; and he decided to go there to see for himself the Akalis in action.\nOn the night of the 19th September, Jawaharlal, with two companions, Gidwani and Santanam, left Delhi for Muktesar, an Akali centre, and after ad\u00ac dressing a meeting there on the 20th, commending the Akali struggle,2 he entered Nabha state on the morning of the 21st, along with a Sikhjatha, at Jaito. Wilson Johnston, the British official who was serving as the administrator of the state, on hearing that Jawaharlal had set out for Nabha, had obtained the permission of the Viceroy and the Home Member to serve an order on Jawaharlal at the frontier of Nabha state forbidding him to enter the state for two months;3 but he had not anti\u00ac cipated that Jawaharlal would come by road on horseback. The result was that Jawaharlal was well within the state before the order was served on him not to enter Nabha on the ground that he and some of his companions were members of the AICC and their presence was likely to lead to a disturbance of the peace. Jawaharlal replied that he had already entered Nabha and could not vanish into thin air, but that he had no intention of leaving the state; and he and his two friends, on whom an oral order had been served, sat down in a rest-house near by. 1924, File I.\n4 Note of Special Commissioner on conditions in Nabha jails, 14 June 19\u00ae3.\n\u00bb 24 September 1923. Thelatterhad by now realized that, even in Nabha, Jawaharlal could not be convicted for entering the state before he had been prohibited from doing so, and decided to alter the charge to one of being in the company of an Akalijatha and therefore of being a member of an unlawful assembly. But the ways of the Nabha administration are not straight.3 The Administrator of Nabha gave orders forbidding Motilal\u2019s entry but was overruled by the Government of India, who ordered that Motilal should be permitted to enter Nabha provided he undertook not to engage in political activities in the state and to leave it immediately after his interview with his son.2 In fact, the reasons for the unsatisfactory nature of the interview were\n> Administrator Nabhastateto Agent, Governor-General Punjab, 22 September 1923. a25 September 1923.\niThe Bombay Cbropiete, 24 September 1923.\n\u2019ToReading, 20March and 26 June 1924.\n6The Bombay Chronicla, 27 September 1923.

The Government of India directed that sentence should be passed on Jawaharlal but it should be announced at the same time that the Nabha Government had suspended its execution without\n1 Motilal to Jawaharlal, 28 September 1923.\n2Jawaharlal to Motilal from Nabha jail, 30 September 1923.\nJawaharlal to Kapil Deva Malaviya and Mahadeva Desai, undated but clearly written from Nabha jail.\u201d\nIN NABHA JAIL 79\ncondition, and Jawaharlal should be expelled from the state. They all left Nabha the same night.was necessary in the interests of their cause to return to Nabha, he and his\u2019companions would do so.2 In fact, the next year, when Gidwani returned to Nabha he was thrown into prison, and Jawaharlal challenged the Administrator to let him have a copy of the suspen\u00ac sion order and to inform him as to whether he too would be arrested if he returned to Nabha.4\nAs Jawaharlal recognized years later in his Autobiography, probably the bold step to have taken, especially as Gidwani had been imprisoned again, would have been for him to return to Nabha.

Yet the jittery Government of India asked the Bombay Government to consider prosecution, and were brought back tp reality only by that Govern\u00ac ment\u2019s comment that everyone must agree with much of what Jawaharlal had said, and it would be difficult to prove that communism and revolution, and not merely socialism, were being advocated.6\nThe Government acquired another opportunity to proceed against Jawahar\u00ac lal at Jharia, where the annual session of the All-India Trade Union Congress was being held.7 But, rather than arrest Jawaharlal, the Government preferred to await the decisions of the National Congress which was to meet in its annual session in a few days at Calcutta.

This hinted that Jawaharlal was willing to shelve temporarily the de\u00ac mand for independence.

For the first time, and as a very special case, the Congress sanctioned Rs 1,500 for the defence, while Jawaharlal sought financial and other assistance from abroad. Indeed for months there was a widespread belief among the public, shared by both Motilal and Jawaharlal, that Jawaharlal himself would soon be arrested.4 In the long indictment of Communist activities made by the prosecution, the League against Imperialism was specially mentioned as one of the organizations inspired by the Communists; Jawaharlal\u2019s correspondence with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and others in Europe was regularly inter\u00ac cepted;9 and the Intelligence Bureau and the Home Department attached great importance to a faked letter from M.

While the Government, by their legislation and summary arrests and trials, mounted a massive attack against the whole labour movement, the latter was riven by sharp differences between the Communists and the rest; and Jawaharlal had to toil hard \u2014 aftd, as it proved, in vain \u2014 merely to hold the movement to\u00ac gether. Jawaharlal was requested by the radicals to accept the presidentcy of the largest railway trade union, that of the Great Indian Peninsular in Bombay, which was dominated by the Com\u00ac munists, and although he already had as much work as he could manage he was willing to consider acceptance if it would help in securing a compromise.2 The fact that the Communists were criticizing Jawaharlal as one of the \u2018dangerous enemies of labour\u20193might have been expected to make his name acceptable to conservative trade unionists; but in fact the suggestion fell through.

But, as regards the problem of peasantry and labour, Jawaharlal asked the Congress to commit itself to ending the domination of any one class over another, and to draw up a programme of such changes as could be immediately put into operation.

Jawaharlal had the police turned out, made a fiery speech and led the infuriated delegates in affiliating the Trade Union Congress to the League.7 But, rather than arrest Jawaharlal, the Government preferred to await the decisions of the National Congress which was to meet in its annual session in a few days at Calcutta.\n\u2019Note ofHome Secretary, 18 October 1928. of 1929.\n4Note, 13 December 1928, ibid.\n\u2019Note of Home Secretary, 27 December 1928, ibid.\n\u2018Teleiram to Bombay Government, 29 December 1928 and Bombay Government\u2019s reply, 11 January 1929, ibid. Jawaharlal was in a difficult position. The final sentence in Jawaharlal\u2019s speech probably gave him the clue: \u2018Pre\u00ac pared as this House should be for any compromise on any lines, it should not be prepared to give up its definite real goal of independence for any length of time.' This hinted that Jawaharlal was willing to shelve temporarily the de\u00ac mand for independence. As a further step to placate Jawaharlal, the time-limit was reduced in discussions to one year. So Jawaharlal and his friends could accept the re\u00ac solution; but to mark his disapproval of even the paper concession, Jawaharlal stayed away from the final session when the resolution was passed.

For the first time, and as a very special case, the Congress sanctioned Rs 1,500 for the defence, while Jawaharlal sought financial and other assistance from abroad. Indeed for months there was a widespread belief among the public, shared by both Motilal and Jawaharlal, that Jawaharlal himself would soon be arrested.4 In the long indictment of Communist activities made by the prosecution, the League against Imperialism was specially mentioned as one of the organizations inspired by the Communists; Jawaharlal\u2019s correspondence with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and others in Europe was regularly inter\u00ac cepted;9 and the Intelligence Bureau and the Home Department attached great importance to a faked letter from M.7 A number of letters received by Jawaharlal from abroad were* cited by the procecution, but they could find no letters written by him; and though his book on Soviet Russia was placed before the\n1 Note of H. of 1928.\n* Note of Haig, 4 January 1929, Home Dept.

On the other hand, Jawaharlal\u2019s colleagues in the League against Imperialism expected that he would use his position to split the Congress and carry the country with a fully revolutionary programme, i Only Jawaharlal knew his predicament, that he would be torn between his loyalty to Gandhi and the Congress organization on the one side, and his ideological leanings on the other. Jawaharlal was getting ready for civil disobedience. Jawaharlal fought hard, if he could not secure rejection of the Viceroy\u2019s proposals, at least to stiffen the terms offered by the Congress: but he failed, and then, to the surprise of his friends, signed the manifesto. \u2019Jawaharlal has nowgiven up Independence at the instanceof the Mahatma.

But though Jawaharlal^ nationalist followers in India now had no grievance, he had still to contend with his radical friends abroad. Convinced by the frequent references to the League against Im\u00ac perialism in the Central Assembly during the debates ori\u2019fhe Public Safety Bill and by the proceedings at Meerut that the Government was making a dead set against the League, Jawaharlal took much trouble during the summer of 1929 to prove to the public that the League was not a Communist organization, even though many Communists belonged to it, but rather an association to establish contacts between all movements throughout the world which supported the struggle against imperialism. But Jawaharlal was certain that in no sense did Communists dominate the League. Chattopadhyaya to Jawaharlal, 4 December 1929. Elected the previous year in his absence, Jawaharlal had agreed to serve because, although he had no experience of trade unionism, he realized the importanceof awakening industrial labour to the national cause. While the Government, by their legislation and summary arrests and trials, mounted a massive attack against the whole labour movement, the latter was riven by sharp differences between the Communists and the rest; and Jawaharlal had to toil hard \u2014 aftd, as it proved, in vain \u2014 merely to hold the movement to\u00ac gether. Jawaharlal, of course, reacted instinctively against this, and in consequence was regarded as acting in accord with the Communists. Jawaharlal was requested by the radicals to accept the presidentcy of the largest railway trade union, that of the Great Indian Peninsular in Bombay, which was dominated by the Com\u00ac munists, and although he already had as much work as he could manage he was willing to consider acceptance if it would help in securing a compromise.2 The fact that the Communists were criticizing Jawaharlal as one of the \u2018dangerous enemies of labour\u20193might have been expected to make his name acceptable to conservative trade unionists; but in fact the suggestion fell through.

To the chagrin ofthese men,whowished to co-operate with the RoyalCommission on Labour appointed by the Government, Jawaharlal publicly called for a boycott. There was such acrimony that Jawaharlal thought of resigning the presidency, but decided that, with the year drawing to its dose, it was not worth while. Jawaharlal\u2019s addresswas wholly acceptable to neither faction, but true to himself. The Second International was disliked by Jawaharlal because it was mainly preoccupied with the fight not against capitalism but against Communism; but the Third Inter\u00ac national had for Jawaharlal its own drawbacks. * '\n2To Bakhale, 24 September 1929, AICC File 16 oI 1929.

It was not so much that Jawaharlal saw his role as president to be akin to that of a figurehead as that, whatever his public posture, he privately approved of most of these decisions.\u20193 Jawaharlal's speech was attuned to this atmosphereofdefiance and rebellion. He had begun to draft his presidential address about the tenth of December,4 but even then he could write with the full knowledge that the talks with the Viceroy had no prospect of success^\nJawaharlal put the Indian problem in its international context.\nThen, reverting to India, Jawaharlal pointed out that though her social struc\u00ac ture had proved to be wonderfully stable, it had failed in one vital particular: it had found no solution for the problem of equality and in fact had deliberately based itselfon inequality.\nThe controversy about the relative merits of independence and Dominion Status was to Jawaharlal really a question about the conquest of power, and he did not think that any form of Dominion Status applicable to India would trans\u00ac fer real power.\n\u2018I must frankly confess\u2019, Jawaharlal continued, 'that I am a Socialist and a republican, and am no believer in kings and princes, or in the order which pro* duces the modern kings of industry, who have greater power over the lives and fortunes ofmen than even the kings of old, and whose methods are as predatory as those of the old feudal aristocracy.\nOn the two particular problems of India, the minorities and the states, Jawaharlal had little that was startlingly new to say. But, as regards the problem of peasantry and labour, Jawaharlal asked the Congress to commit itself to ending the domination of any one class over another, and to draw up a programme of such changes as could be immediately put into operation.\nThe presidential address shows both the strength and the weakness of Jawaharlal at this stage.

Jawaharlal had not been enamoured of the eleven points earlier put forward by Gandhi.3 But law-breaking was invigorating in itself, and his support for Gandhi now was without any mental reservation.\u20194 Gandhi\u2019s march to the sea at Dandi, with a small group of tough and disciplined men and women, has a high place, as fact and as legend, in the history of the Indian freedom movement and, indeed, of freedom in the world. The challenge gripped the imagination in India and beyond, and the refusal of Irwin\u2019s Government to arrest Gandhi in the belief that the march would evoke no response showed how little they were aware of the true situation. Thousands lined the route, large meetings were held at every halting-place, and many village and district officials resigned, while the rest of India was enthralled by every detail of Gandhi\u2019s progress. Jawaharlal with a few friends went down to Gujarat and marched with Gandhi for one stage, and the impression left on him was profound and permanent.

The first session of the Round Table Conference had made dear that it was futile to discuss Indian problems with anyone except the Congress: \u2018no Indian delegation\u2019, wrote the corres\u00ac pondent in India of The Times, \u2018without a three-quarter line composed of Gandhi on one wing, the two Nehrus in the centre, and Malaviya or Patel on the other, can possibly be looked on as representative.\u20192The Viceroy also came round to the recognition that logically there were only two alternatives: to govern without consent or to make terms with Gandhi.3 On 17 January 1931 theViceroy, in the new, Christian style of imperialism, appealed to Gandhi for co-operation on a basis of mutual trust; and two days later the Prime Mini\u00ac ster, Ramsay MacDonald, offered provincial autonomy, responsibility of the central executive to a federal legislature with some safeguards for minorities during a period of transition, and reforms in the existing constitution pending final decisionon permanentchanges. Gandhi was unwilling to reject the Government\u2019s overtures out of hand both because he sensed a kindred spirit in the Viceroy, and because he believed that the war-weariness was more widespread than Jawaharlal was willing to recognize.\nJust at this moment, however, Gandhi\u2019s ways were wholly alien to him.\n*For an analysis of this, see Bipan Chandra, \u2018Elements of Continuity and Change in Early Nationalist Activity*, paper read at the Indian History Congress, December 1972.\u2019 Assuming that the Congress was committed to the position Gandhi and the others had taken up at Yeravda the year before,2 and expect\u00ac ing, till almost the very end,3 the talks to break down, the actual terms came to Jawaharial as a severe jolt. Gandhi had agreed to discontinue civil disobedience in return for a partial amnesty limited to those not charged with violence, and permission to picket peacefully and to manufacture salf under certain con\u00ac ditions; and he committed Congress to take part in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference to consider a scheme of federation and responsibility with safe\u00ac guards 'in the interests of India* for such matters as defence, external affairs, the position of minorities, financial credit and the discharge of obligations. Nor had Gandhi stood firm on the demands for a general amnesty, an inquiry, into police excesses, which to Jawaharial was preliminary to any participation in the Round Table Con\u00ac ference,4 the return of all immovable property which had been attached, and the unlimited right to collect salt.3\nIt appeared to most members of the Working Committee, and above all to Jawaharial, that Gandhi had been outwitted and, in return for some empty phrases which recognized the indispensability of Congress in any Indian settlement, had yielded on every crucial issue and ignored the long-term objectives. But Gandhi threatened to retire if his settlement were repudiated and demanded personal loyalty even if not approval.\n2 See his continents to t journalist, 18 February, Tba Tribum, 22 February 1931.' Jawaharial to Vijayalakshmi Pandit, 28 February 1931. It has frequently been suggested that Gandhi secured this by agreeing, in turn,\u2018to a resolution, drafted by Jawaharlal and revised by him, committing the organization to provide in any future constitution for not only the basic civil liberties, adult suffrage and free primary education, but also \u2018real economic freedom\u2019. Haitbcox, Communism and Nationalism in India (Princeton, 1971), pp.\n2To Onkar Nath Verma, 2 December 1933. Once the settlement had been reached, Jawaharlal, \u2018lonely and almost uninterested\u2019 as Gandhi described him,1 in\u00ac formed his colleagues that he was unable to accept or reconcile himself to the references to safeguards and reservations.3 No permanent damage had been done to Indian nationalism. Gandhi had not broken, but only ignored, the logic of the struggle for freedom; that struggle, in fact, could only end with the attainment of independence. Till then, in the period of neither peace nor war, it was Jawaharlal\u2019s duty to keep the spirit of battle alive, to respect the cohesion of the party and to abide by the leadership of Gandhi. The fears of the Brftish Government4 that he might split with Gandhi and cariy on civil disobedience on his own showed how little they knew him.3\n\u2018See Gandhi\u2019s handwritten note to Jawaharlal, AICC File G 6(KWXi) 1931.\n\u2019To Anjani Kumar, 21 July 1931.", "Ariel_And_Disraeli_1930": "\n2The Leader, 19 March 1930.8 \u202228 July 1930.", "Constitutional_Issue_1930": " File 65 of 1930. * Statefnent, 6 January, The Tribune, 8 January 1930. * 4 Gandhi to Jawaharlal, 12 January 1930, AICC File 26 of 1930.\n9 To Secretaries, League against Imperialism, 30 January 1930.\n3 The Problem of Minorities', 14 March 1930, reprinted in Young India, 13 May 1930.

Between 1900 and 1931 rents had increased by Rs 669 lakhs while land revenue had increased by only Rs 75 lakhs. But this acceptance of tenancy right had its darker side, in that rents were stabilized at a time when they were high. But there were no occupancy rights in Avadh; conditions were slightly better in the Agra districts, but evictions were widespread throughout the province, the landlords being eager to evict occupancy tenants.\nThe agrarian question, therefore, in the United Provinces was much more an economic than a political one; and even after the truce of March 1931 there were many instances of landlords and the police acting together in evicting and harassing tenants in order to extract rents. Tenants were advised to pay what was possible, which in general appeared to be 50 per cent by occupancy tenants and 40 per cent by statutory tenants, provided the landlords gave receipts for the full amount.

Jawaharlal, unlike Gandhi, was encumbered by complex thought, but in the matter of worldly goods he was becoming as much of a political ascetic. Travelling round the country, Jawaharlal was convinced that never, at any rate since 1857, had there been such extraordinary bitterness against the Govern\u00ac ment and such a passionate desire tc be rid of it.\nJawaharlal had till now deliberately ignored thegrowth of the communal evil in Indian politics in the hope that public attention could be diverted from it by emphasis on the positive aspects of the national struggle.

It was true that Jawaharlal had not carefully probed this issue, and was irritated by the Mahasabha\u2019s criticisms of Gandhi and the Congress and its open wooing of the Government. Government had little doubt that Jawaharlal\u2019s main object was to organize the masses and \u2018inoculate them with the virus of Communism*.6\nJawaharlal\u2019s activities in particular were made to sound dangerous enough to require his speedy return to prison.7 \u2018My one hope is that Jawaharlal is such a temperamental person that he may go off the deep end before long and we shall be able to get him back into jail, which is really the safest place for a person with his political views. 1933), pp. File 169 of 1933.\n\u2666Ellen Wilkinson to Jawaharlal, January 1936.

So generally Jawaharlal fretted.\u20191 But it added to the intense despair of Jawaharlal.3\nIn June 1932 Jawaharlal was transferred to Dehra Dunjail. Jawaharlal was even permitted to take his walks outside theprison gates. Indeed, on hearing of the savage treatment df political prisoners in other jails in the United Provinces, Jawaharlal felt ashamed of the better conditions of his own prison life, and he invited the Government to give him the same treatment as the others.4\nJawaharlalwasconcerned, too, about hiswife and mother roughing it out on their own and his two sisters languishing in jail; but it was the thought of his growing daughter that frequently came strongly to him and filled his mind.\n1 Letter (in Hindi) to Jawaharlal, 16 April 1932.\n\u2019Letter to Indira, New Year's Day 1933, GUmptss, p.

Thompson's letter to Jawaharlal, 3 May 1937 A Bunch of Oid Letters, pp. The thought that Gandhi might die, and for such a minor reason, and that the onlyremaining protective forcein his life might be removed, knocked Jawaharlal for a time off balance. The two telegrams Jawaharlal sent in reply indicate his bewilderment and dread of personal loss. His mother was seriously ill, the province wasquiet, the Congress, with Gandhi\u2019s assistance, had seemed to have succeeded in tying itself into knots, and Jawaharlal himself was (erroneously) believed bytheGovernment to be in favour ofgiving upcivil disobedience.\n*Diary entry, 18 July 1933.1\nJawaharlal\u2019s comment, on emerging from jail, that he attached little impor\u00ac tance to theswadeshi and Harijan movements, the reports of his talks with his colleagues in the U. 2 Statement at Kanpur, 1 September, The Leader, 3 September 1933; interview in the Pioneer 1 September 1933; statement to the press, 4 September, The Ladder, 6 Septeember 1933; report of Banaras correspondent, 11 September, Th* Leader, 13 September 1933. * Jawaharlal was apparently not alone in thinking this.

These three articles, written in October 1933, provide the clearest exposition of Jawaharlal's views at this time. However sharp his expression of disagreement in private conversation, to the outside world he was determined to accept Con-\n1 Jawaharlal'sstatement tothe press, 11 September, Tba Laadtr,16 September 1933; Jawaharlal's letter, 13 September and Gandhi\u2019s reply, 14 September 1933.\n* Interview in Tba Bomba,y CbronicU, 18 September 1933. Indeed, suggested Jawaharlal, it would be simpler, instead of a variety ofordinances and orders and rules, to have a com\u00ac prehensive enactment abolishing all schools and colleges and suppressing all newspapers and books, and layingdown that every Indian must consider himself in prison (\u2018C Class), salute the Union Jack every morning and sing the British national anthem at divine service twice a day; \u2018and the afternoons might be profitably devoted to listening to an inspiring address on the virtues of British rule\u2019. Jawaharlal, unlike Gandhi, was encumbered by complex thought, but in the matter of worldly goods he was becoming as much of a political ascetic. Travelling round the country, Jawaharlal was convinced that never, at any rate since 1857, had there been such extraordinary bitterness against the Govern\u00ac ment and such a passionate desire tc be rid of it.\nJawaharlal had till now deliberately ignored thegrowth of the communal evil in Indian politics in the hope that public attention could be diverted from it by emphasis on the positive aspects of the national struggle. Bielvi, 3 December 1933-\n* To Jawaharlal, 27 November 1933.\u2019 In Jawaharlal\u2019s understanding, there were shades of both in Muslim communalism.1\nObviously Jawaharlal had no illusions about organizations which worked under theleadership of so feudal and reactionary a figure as the Aga Khan. It was true that Jawaharlal had not carefully probed this issue, and was irritated by the Mahasabha\u2019s criticisms of Gandhi and the Congress and its open wooing of the Government. The Government were as anxious as Jawaharlal to get him back in prison as soon as possible. Government had little doubt that Jawaharlal\u2019s main object was to organize the masses and \u2018inoculate them with the virus of Communism*.6\nJawaharlal\u2019s activities in particular were made to sound dangerous enough to require his speedy return to prison.7 \u2018My one hope is that Jawaharlal is such a temperamental person that he may go off the deep end before long and we shall be able to get him back into jail, which is really the safest place for a person with his political views. 1933), pp.\n\u2666Ellen Wilkinson to Jawaharlal, January 1936.\nIN AND OUT OF PRISON\n185\nment now was not so much Jawaharlal\u2019s efforts in the rural areas as the impact of his writings and speeches on the lower middle classes.\u20194 In December the Chief Commissioner of Delhi was asked to consider if Jawaharlal could be arrested for a speech denouncing British exploitation and the feudal autocracy of the Princes.3 All Local Governments were then ordered once again to examine Jawaharlal\u2019s speeches carefully with a view to prosecution on some serious charge involving a substantial sentence of imprisonment. On his visit to Calcutta in January, Jawaharlal had in forthright terms condemned the vulgarity of imperialism and stressed that there was no half-way house between nationalism and imperialism.

As the one man among the leaders who was neither cowed nor shaken in nerve was jawaharlal, the authorities stalked him till they once more had him behind bars.\u20192 The Bengal authorities did not encourage reading and writing, and for some time, after he had exhausted the novels in the prison library, the only book Jawaharlal had was a German grammar.\u20193 An undated, incomplete note obviously written at this time indicates that Jawaharlal was being driven once more to the recognition that he had come to a parting of the ways. 4\n188\nJAWAHARLAL NRHRU\ngreatest revolutionary force in the country and seeking to combine the national struggle with socialism. Yet Jawaharlal refused, while out of prison, tcf give them any encouragement. Jawaharlal had a radical rather than an ideological mind. It can be argued that Jawaharlal was giving up too easily, that while he had a socialist vision derived from Europe he lacked the stamina to formulate specific programmes suited to India and promote the strenuous work of forming cadres and establishing an organization \u2014 in other words, that he lacked a 'revolutionary perspective\u2019. authorities, however, feared that the Socialist Party, which was the \u2019greatest menace to peace in the rural areas\u2019, had about fifteen centres in the province, very few of which were really active; but they would all receive a tre\u00ac mendous fillip when Jawaharlal came out of jail.\n\u00bb Jsyaprakash Narayan to Rajendra Prasad, 25 July 1934,#U.\n* SuhhasBose, TbtIndian Struggle (Calcutta, 1964), p.

He wasforajoint front against imperialism; indeed, he regarded the Congress under Gandhi as already in essence such a front which only required to be widened. But he was not ready to abandon Gandhi\u2019s leadership or the method of non-violence. AsforGandhi, as Palme Dutt reports it,9 Jawahar\u00ac lal had confessed that he felt in his nature an aristocrat; he was sorry for the Indian people, it moved his heart to see them turn to him for guidance, but he lacked the common touch and could not get as close to them as Gandhi did, though even Gandhi was not of the masses. This, according to Jawaharlal, was the source of his tremendous deference to Gandhi; and his audience doubtless recognized that, by its very nature, it could not be set aside for intellectual reasons. He condemned imperialism for its horrors, its indecency and vulgarity as much as for its exploitation, and appreciated Gandhi above all for the psychological transformation he had wrought in the Indian people.4 In an article written at about this time in answer to Indian left-wing criticism of Gandhi, Jawaharlal contended that Gandhi had played a revolu\u00ac tionary role in India because he had reached the heart of the masses while groups with a more advanced ideology had functioned largely in the air. Till his return to India, no major decisions had been taken, and the party, as Gandhi described it, was 'literally tacking\u2019.7 Meeting Gandhi and senior Congressmen before the session at Lucknow, Jawaharlal found considerable support for office acceptance; and he was isolated in the Working Committee.8 But embarrassment to him was avoided by shelving any firm decision on an issue which would only arise after\n> Noteon a Constituent Assembly for India, 25 February 1936.\n* Seehis letters to Lord Lothian, 9 December 1935and 17 January 1936.\n*Mahatma Gandhi, 20 January 1936.\n\u2022To Jawaharlal, 22 September 1935. ,\nTTo Rajeulra Prasad, 20 November 1935, Home Dept.\n\u2022To Sye&Mahmud, 5 May 1936. 1 These resolutions, along with that opposing India\u2019s participa\u00ac tion in any imperialist war,jvere drafted by Jawaharlal and, as he wrote later, increased his confidence in himself.

But at Wardha, when the Working Committee metin the firstweek of July, Jawaharlal was plainly rebuked by Gandhi and the others.\u2019 But Gandhi pulled him up for arrogance, intolerance and lack of a sense of humour. The socialist outlook, which the Congress had been stress\u00ac ing since Gandhi took it over, helped in the political struggle by clearing the issues and strengthening the role of the masses.

Throughout India there were men and women who, along with nationalist feeling, had developed a conscience on economic matters, who saw in Jawaharlal the spokesman of their viewpoint, and who, because of him, followed the lead of the Congress even if they did not belong to it. He was, too, the only Indian politician who had an international audience, and it was he who secured for the party recognition on the world stage. Had Jawaharlal, therefore, insisted in the summer of 1936 on resigning the presidency, it is difficult to believe that Gandhi and his followers would have been short\u00ac sighted enough to let him do so. The psycholo\u00ac gical hankering to follow Gandhi and the ingrained loyalty to the party were only part of the explanation. His weakness he justified to himself by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the rapid drive to a world war which made it all the more necessary to see the Indian problem in perspective as part of the world struggle and concentrate on the fight against imperialism. on \u2018Congress and Socialism', The Bombay Chronicle, 20and 31 July 1936; statement on the Punja| peasantry, 12 August, The Tribune, 13 August 1936.\n2 See AICC FileG 71 of 1936.

Fischer, A Waak with Gandhi (London, 1945). Jawaharlal, more than most Congressmen, was guided by his antipathy to Nazi Germany, Japan and fascism, and sympathy for Russia and China; but even his attitude was, in the ultimate analysis, dictated by a strong sense of India's survival. Jawaharlal was against a mass civil disobedience move\u00ac ment, but Gandhi thought in terms of such direct action after the public mind had been prepared for it and in such a manner as not to aid the Japanese, 'll you won\u2019t join', Gandhi is reported to have told Jawaharlal, \u2018Ill do it without you.

In 1941 the Viceroy directed the Governor of the Punjab to dissuade Sikandar Hyat Khan from resigning from the League, and rejected Zafrulla Khan\u2019s advice to split the League by appointing to the Executive Council Muslims who were unacceptable to Jinnah.\n302\nJAWAHARLAL NEHRU\nof the way from 1942, Jinnah strengthened both his stature within the League and the League\u2019s command of the Muslim masses. In contrast to Jawaharlal\u2019s interpretationof the growing influence of the League as a reflection of the backwardness of the Muslim masses and their acceptance of feudal leadership, the Communists regarded the communal problem as one of multi-national consciousness.4\nThe outcome of the conference confirmed Jawaharlal\u2019s suspicions of British motives, for Wavell acted as a total partisan of the Muslim League. Alexander, he \u2018had no conscious feeling that he had been partisan in favour of the Muslim League, but 1 could understand that as he had been Commander-in-Chief in India in 1942, he was bound to remem\u00ac ber that whilst the Muslim League were not politically active in his support, they did not, as the Congress Party had, organise the sabotage and destruction of his communications whilst he was trying to keep the Japs out of India.\u20191 So in the summer of 1945, when the immediate fortunes of the League were unpromising and it could not control the ministries in any of the provinces where Muslims were in a majority \u2014 the Punjab, NWFP, Sind, Bengal and Assam \u2014 Wavell assisted the League by the first of his many acts of partiality. His offer to Jinnah was that, of the five Muslims chosen, four should be from the League and one from the Punjab Unionist Party.3 This was virtual refusal to regard the Congress as a non-Hindu, secular organization, and ac\u00ac ceptance of Jinnah\u2019s contention that it was as much a communal party as the League.\nHowever, this was not acceptable to Jinnah, who insisted that all Muslim\nmembers should belong to the League and that, in an Executive Council so\nformed, the Muslim members should have a veto on all important decisions. Communists who have joined the Muslim League appear to be more rabid Leaguers than others.1\nIn the provinces where Muslims formed a majority, the League did not secure a majority of votes. Except in the NWFP,\nwhere the Congress had a dear majority of 30 seats, including X9 Muslim seats, and the League only 17, the League secured all or most of the reserved Muslim seats. However unpractical the concept of partition and imprecise the notion of Pakistan, they had struck a response in the minds of many middle-class Muslims. But this was an ideal which neither the British nor the Muslim League would help to realize; and the Con\u00ac gress had to take into account the fact of the League\u2019s electoral gains and work out its ideas of a constitutional settlement on this basis.1 Given a sense of freedom, the Muslim masses, at any rate, would realize the absurdity of Pakistan. * Interviews to the press, The Hindustan Timer, 4 and 7 April 1946. * Even in January 1946, Liaqat Alt Khan told the Viceroy that the British would have to stay in India for many-years, and the Muslims were not at all anxious that they should go., 6 March 1946.
