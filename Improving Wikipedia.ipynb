This was my first journey from Rajkot to Ahmedabad and that too without a companion. With the blessings of my elders, I started for Bombay. This was my first journey from Rajkot to Bombay. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in.  I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I  should be able to render the greatest service to the country through  the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre  of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field  for the revival of the cottage industry of hand-spinning.  The question of untouchability was naturally among the subjects  discussed with the Ahmedabad friends.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad. Jivanlal Desai, a  barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me.  At the same time there came a letter from Shrimati Anasuyabai about  the condition of labour in Ahmedabad.

There was a Vegetarian Society in England  with a weekly journal of its own. Here I  came in contact with those who were regarded as pillars of  vegetarianism, and began my own experiments in dietetics. I came across  three definitions of meat in England. Vegetarians who accepted  that definition abjured the flesh of birds and beasts, but ate fish, not  to mention eggs. This was a hardship  inasmuch as inquiry showed that even in vegetarian restaurants many  courses used to contain eggs. My mother's interpretation of meat  was, according to the golden rule, the only true one for me, and not the  one my wider experience or my pride of better knowledge might have  taught me. Vegetarianism was then a new cult in England,  and likewise for me, because, as we have seen, I had gone there a  convinced meat-eater, and was intellectually converted to vegetarianism  later.

Many of them were old residents, and most of them,  far from wanting to stay in Natal, meant to go to the Transvaal. In  those days the Transvaal offered better prospects than Natal to  those coming in search of wealth, and most Indians, therefore,  preferred to go there.  It enhanced the prestige of the Indian community in South Africa and  made my work easier.The officers at the head of the new department were at a loss to know  how I had entered the Transvaal. This was the case in  South Africa. The government had passed a Peace Preservation  Ordinance, which provided that anyone entering the Transvaal without  a permit should be liable to arrest and imprisonment.

So whilst in Natal I was admitted as an advocate, in the  Transvaal I sought admission as an attorney.  But even in the Transvaal it was open to attorneys to appear before  magistrates.

In a certain case  in my charge I saw that, though justice was on the side of my  client, the law seemed to be against him. But I also saw  that the litigation, if it were persisted in, would ruin  the plaintiff and the defendant, who were relatives and both  belonged to the same city. As lawyers the  counsel on both sides were bound to rake up points of law in support  of their own clients.  I realized that the true function of a lawyer was to unite parties  riven asunder.

I wanted  to popularize it in Natal. Therefore, with full explanation of my reasons, I  recommended that the organization should be called the Natal Indian  Congress, and on the 22nd May the Natal Indian Congress came into  being. As, therefore, no work was done unless there  were funds on hand, the Natal Indian Congress has never been in  debt. Every  pie was thus clearly accounted for, and I dare say the account books  for the year 1894 can be found intact even today in the records of  Natal Indian Congress.  Another feature of the Congress was service of colonial-born  educated Indians. The Colonial-born Indian Educational Association  was founded under the auspices of the Congress. This consisted in  acquainting the English in South Africa and England and people in  India with the real state of things in Natal.  It contained a statement, supported by evidence, of the general  condition of Natal Indians.  It contained a brief history of the Indian franchise in Natal with  facts and figures.  All this activity resulted in winning the Indians numerous friends  in South Africa and in obtaining the active sympathy of all parties  in India.  Although the members of the Natal Indian Congress included the  colonial-born Indians and the clerical class, the unskilled wage-earners, the indentured labourers were still outside its pale.', 'natal indians': ' In the same year, 1894, the Natal Government sought to impose an annual tax  of Â£25 on the indentured Indians. The Natal Government therefore  corresponded with the Indian Government, and secured their  permission to recruit Indian labour. These recruits were to sign an  indenture to work in Natal for five years, and at the end of the  term they were to be at liberty to settle there and to have full  rights of ownership of land.  This sowed the seed of the antagonism to Indians. And when it was realized, it came as a result of the labours of not only the Natal Indians but of all the Indians in  South Africa. The sufferings of the Indians were  the expression of that truth.', 'natal zulus': ' Without outside labour the cultivation of cane and  the manufacture of sugar were impossible, as the Natal Zulus were  not suited to this form of work. The Natal Government therefore  corresponded with the Indian Government, and secured their  permission to recruit Indian labour. And when it was realized, it came as a result of the labours of not only the Natal Indians but of all the Indians in  South Africa.', 'taxation': ' What  impelled me, however, to make a deep study of their condition was  the campaign for bringing them under special heavy taxation. In the same year, 1894, the Natal Government sought to impose an annual tax  of Â£25 on the indentured Indians. At the outset I must explain briefly the genesis of the tax. Through  legislation this antagonism found its expression in the  disfranchising bill and the bill to impose a tax on the indentured  Indians. in the case of his refusal to return to India or renew the indenture he should pay an annual tax of Â£25. To levy a yearly tax of Â£12 from a  family of four â€“ husband, wife and two children â€“ when the average  income of the husband was never more than 14s.  We organized a fierce campaign against this tax. It may be possible that the Indian Government had  disapproved of the Â£25 tax from the beginning and reduced it to Â£3,  irrespective of the opposition from the Congress.  The Congress could not regard it as any great achievement to have  succeeded in getting the tax reduced from Â£25 to Â£3. It ever remained its determination to get  the tax remitted, but it was twenty years before the determination was  realized.', 'servant': '  A good servant is essential in every household.

I  therefore vied with Englishmen in loyalty to the throne. Whenever there was an  occasion for the expression of loyalty without fuss or ostentation,  I readily took part in it.

But it was  in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing brahmacharya even with respect to my wife. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. The importance of vows grew upon me  more clearly than ever before. I realized that a vow, far from  closing the door to real freedom, opened it. I  realized that in refusing to take a vow man was drawn into  temptation, and that to be bound by a vow was like a passage from  libertinism to a real monogamous marriage. 'But supposing my views  are changed in the future, how can I bind myself by a vow.After full discussion and mature deliberation I took the vow in 1906. I  had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only  consulted her at the time of taking the vow.  As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow, I am  filled with pleasure and wonderment. But the  freedom and joy that came to me after taking the vow had never been  experienced before 1906. Before the vow I had been open to being  overcome by temptation at any moment. Now the vow was a sure shield  against temptation. The great potentiality of brahmacharya  daily became more an more patent to me. The vow was taken when I was  in Phoenix. As though  unknown to me, the brahmacharya vow had been preparing me for it. I had cut down my heavy household expenses at  Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take, as it were, the  brahmacharya vow.  The knowledge that a perfect observance of brahmacharya  means realization of brahman,  I did not owe to a study of the Shastras. Every day of the vow has taken me nearer the knowledge that  in brahmacharya lies the protection of the body, the mind and the soul. For brahmacharya  was now no process of hard penance, it was a matter of consolation  and joy.  Control of the palate is the first essential in the observance of  the vow. As the result of these experiments I saw that the brahmachari's  food should be limited, simple, spiceless, and, if possible, uncooked.  Six years of experiment have showed me that the brahmachari's  ideal food is fresh fruit and nuts. Brahmacharya needed no effort on my part in South Africa when I lived on fruits  and nuts alone. It is enough to observe here  that I have not the least doubt that milk diet makes the  brahmacharya vow difficult to observe. Let no one deduce from this that all brahmacharis must give up milk. The effect on  brahmacharya of different kinds of food can be determined only after numerous  experiments.  As an external aid to brahmacharya,  fasting is as necessary as selection and restriction in diet. But it may be said that extinction of the sexual passion is  as a rule impossible without fasting, which may be said to be  indispensable for the observance of brahmacharya. Many  aspirants after brahmacharya fail because in the use of their  other senses they want to carry on like those who are not brahmacharis. There  should be a clear line between the life of a brahmachari and  of one who is not. Both  use their eyesight, but whereas the brahmachari uses it to see the  glories of God, the other uses it to see the frivolity around him. Brahmacharya means control of the senses in thought, word and  deed. There is no limit  to the possibilities of renunciation, even as there is none to those  of brahmacharya. Such brahmacharya is impossible of attainment by  limited effort. An  aspirant after brahmacharya will always be conscious of his  shortcomings, will seek out the passions lingering in the innermost  recesses of his heart and will incessantly strive to get rid of  them. So long as thought is not under complete control of the will, brahmacharya in its fullness is absent.  But it was after coming to India that I realized that such brahmacharya  was impossible to attain by mere human effort. Meanwhile let me make it clear that those  who desire to observe brahmacharya with a view to realizing God need not despair, provided their faith  in God is equal to their confidence in their own effort.\", 'brahmacharya': 'We now reach the stage in this story when I began seriously to think of  taking the brahmacharya vow. But it was  in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing brahmacharya even with respect to my wife. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. At a later  stage more changes were introduced for the sake of supporting brahmacharya. Books on vegetarianism strengthened the idea, but so long  as I had not taken the brahmacharya vow I could not make up my mind to forego milk.  I must here utter a warning for the aspirants of brahmacharya.  Though I have made out an intimate connection between diet and brahmacharya,  it is certain that mind is the principal thing.', 'vow': 'After full discussion and mature deliberation I took the vow in 1906.

When the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the  Boers, but I believed then that I had yet no right, in such cases,  to enforce my individual convictions. The Boer had shown more  pluck, determination and bravery than had been expected; and our  services were ultimately needed.

It was not easy for them to see that  Satyagraha could not be conducted simply by means of money.  At the same time the Satyagrahi volunteers had to learn the new  lesson of simplicity. We  had, therefore, to go about from village to village explaining the  principles of Satyagraha. Experience has taught me that civility  is the most difficult part of Satyagraha.

I had been  used to fasting now and again, but for purely health reasons. That  fasting was necessary for self-restraint I learnt from a friend.  At that time I did not understand, nor  did I believe in, the efficacy of fasting. As a rule Hindus allow themselves milk and fruit on a fasting  day, but such fast I had been keeping daily. So now I began complete  fasting, allowing myself only water.  I have purposely digressed in the midst of this chapter on fasting,  as I could not have given these pleasant reminiscences anywhere  else, and I have indirectly described a characteristic of mine,  namely that I have always loved to have my co-workers with me in  anything that has appealed to me as being good. They were quite new  to fasting, but thanks to the pradosha and ramzan  fasts, it was easy for me to interest them in fasting as a means of  self-restraint. But I know that it does not necessarily  follow that fasting and similar disciplines would have the same  effect for all.  Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it is undertaken  with a view to self-restraint. Some of my friends have actually  found their animal passion and palate stimulated as an after-effect  of fasts. That is to say, fasting is futile unless it is accompanied  by an incessant longing for self-restraint.', 'tolstoy farm': 'It was at Tolstoy Farm that Mr.', 'commanding officer': \"  I have already said that an officer was appointed in charge of our  training, as soon as our names were approved and enlisted.

I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I  should be able to render the greatest service to the country through  the Gujarati language. There was  also the hope that, the city being the capital of Gujarat, monetary  help from its wealthy citizens would be more available here than  elsewhere.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad. Jivanlal Desai, a  barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me.', 'satyagraha ashram': \" The Satyagraha Ashram was founded on the 25th of May, 1915. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad. So my companions and I selected the name 'Satyagraha  Ashram', as conveying both our goal and our method of service. For the conduct of the Ashram a code of rules and observances was  necessary.  This is how the Ashram started.\", 'amritlal thakkar': \" I received a letter from  Amritlal Thakkar to this effect: 'A humble and honest untouchable  family is desirous of joining your Ashram. I had never expected that an untouchable family  with an introduction from no less a man than Thakkar Bapa would so  soon be seeking admission to the Ashram.  I wrote to Amritlal Thakkar expressing our willingness to accept the  family, provided all the members were ready to abide by the rules of  the Ashram.\", 'ashram': \"The Ashram had been in existence only a few months when we were put to a  test such as I had scarcely expected. I received a letter from  Amritlal Thakkar to this effect: 'A humble and honest untouchable  family is desirous of joining your Ashram.  But their admission created a flutter amongst the friends who had  been helping the Ashram. 'I  want to give the Ashram some help. The gentleman had never before visited the Ashram.  Just as there was a storm outside so there was a storm in the Ashram  itself.  The admission of this family proved a valuable lesson to the Ashram.  In the very beginning we proclaimed to the world that the Ashram  would not countenance untouchability. Those who wanted to help the  Ashram were thus put on their guard, and the work of the Ashram in  this direction was considerably simplified. The fact that it is  mostly the real orthodox Hindus who have met the daily growing  expenses of the Ashram is perhaps a clear indication that  untouchability is shaken to its foundation.Before I proceed to describe the progress of the labour dispute it is  essential to have a peep into the Ashram. All the while I was in  Champaran the Ashram was never out of my mind, and occasionally I  paid it flying visits.  At that time the Ashram was in Kochrab, a small village near  Ahmedabad.  Our ideal was to have the Ashram at a safe distance both from town  and village, and yet at a manageable distance from either.  Punjabhai Hirachand, a merchant in Ahmedabad, had come in close  contact with the Ashram, and used to serve us in a number of matters  in a pure and selfless spirit.  The Ashram had been slowly growing.

I met some of the leaders,  wrote in the press, and saw that public opinion was solidly in favour of  immediate abolition. In the meantime the Viceroy had made no secret of the meaning of  'the eventual abolition', which, as he said, was abolition 'within  such reasonable time as will allow of alternative arrangements  introduced. There were three proposals, viz, for  abolition 'as soon as possible', abolition 'by the 31st July', and  'immediate abolition'. Lallubhai was for 'immediate' abolition.\", 'indigo': '  I must confess that I did not then know even the name, much less the  geographical position, of Champaran, and I had hardly any notion of  indigo plantations. I had seen packets of indigo, but little dreamed  that it was grown and manufactured in Champaran at great hardship to  thousands of agriculturists.', 'professor kripalani': '  Principal Kripalani was then in Muzaffarpur.

Castor oil, quinine and  sulphur ointment were the only drugs provided to the volunteers. If  the patient showed a furred tongue or complained of constipation,  castor oil was administered, in case of fever quinine was given  after an opening dose of castor oil, and the sulphur ointment was  applied in case of boils and itch after thoroughly washing the  affected parts.

Such compliance is not, however, the willing and spontaneous  obedience that is required of a Satyagrahi. A Satyagrahi obeys the  laws of society intelligently and of his own free will, because he  considers it to be his sacred duty to do so. As soon as I  entered the Kheda district, all the old recollections of the Kheda Satyagraha struggle came back to me, and I wondered how I could have  failed to perceive what was so obvious. That being so,  before restarting civil disobedience on a mass scale, it would be  necessary to create a band of well-tried, pure-hearted volunteers  who thoroughly understood the strict conditions of Satyagraha.  With these thoughts filling my mind I reached Bombay, raised a corps  of Satyagrahi volunteers through the Satyagraha Sabha there, and  with their help commenced the work of educating the people with  regard to the meaning and inner significance of Satyagraha.  But whilst this work was going on, I could see that it was a  difficult task to interest the people in the peaceful side of  Satyagraha.', 'jalianwala bagh tragedy': ' Before this  outrage the Jalianwala Bagh tragedy paled into insignificance in my  eyes, though it was this massacre principally that attracted the  attention of the people of India and of the world.', 'punjab situation': \"Thus, whilst this movement for the preservation of non-violence was making  steady though slow progress on the one hand, Government's policy of  lawless repression was in full career on the other, and was  manifesting itself in the Punjab in all its nakedness.  I was pressed to proceed to the Punjab immediately in disregard of  consequences. If I proceeded without the  necessary permission, I should not be allowed to cross the boundary  of the Punjab, but left to find what satisfaction I could from civil  disobedience. As things  stood, to break the order against my entry into the Punjab could, it  seemed to me, hardly be classed as civil disobedience, for I did not  see around me the kind of peaceful atmosphere that I wanted, and the  unbridled repression in the Punjab had further served to aggravate  and deepen the feelings of resentment. I therefore decided not to proceed  to the Punjab in spite of the suggestion of friends. Tales of rank injustice and oppression came  pouring in daily from the Punjab, but all I could do was to sit  helplessly by and gnash my teeth. He had not liked my  breaking the prohibitory order of the Punjab Government without the  permission of the Satyagraha Committee, and had fully endorsed the  decision to suspend civil disobedience. I was anxious to expound  the inner meaning of Satyagraha to the public, and also hoped that  through this effort I should at least be able to do justice to the  Punjab situation.\", 'punjab government': \"Sir Michael O'Dwyer held me responsible for all that had happened in the  Punjab, and some irate young Punjabis held me responsible for the  martial law.  Some of them even went the length of threatening me with  assassination if I went to the Punjab. I was impatient to go to the Punjab. Kitchlu and Pandit Rambhaj Dutt Chowdhari, who had  invited me to the Punjab, were at this time in jail. A large number of Punjabis used to  come and see me whenever I was in Bombay. But my going to the Punjab had to be postponed again and again. In the meantime the Hunter Committee was announced to hold an  inquiry in connection with the Punjab Government's doings under the  martial law. Andrews had now reached the Punjab. I once more telegraphed to the Viceroy asking whether I could  now go to the Punjab. Owing to the principal Punjab leaders being in jail, their place, I  found, had been properly taken up by Pandit Malaviyaji, Pandit  Motilalji and the late Swami Sharddhanandji.

Surely no mills supplied  slivers to the ancients. How did they make their slivers then.  With these thoughts in my mind I suggested to Gangabehn to find  carders who could supply slivers. She trained a few  youngsters to make slivers out of the carded cotton.  In Bombay, again, the same old problem of obtaining a supply of  hand-made slivers presented itself.

So we began to pilfer stumps of cigarettes thrown away by my uncle. In the meantime we heard that the stalks of a certain plant were porous and could be smoked like cigarettes. We got them and began this kind of smoking. The thought of suicide ultimately resulted in both of us bidding good-bye to the habit of smoking stumps of cigarettes and of stealing the servant's coppers for the purpose of smoking. Ever since I have been grown up, I have never desired to smoke and have always regarded the habit of smoking as barbarous, dirty and harmful. I have never understood why there is such a rage for smoking throughout the world. I cannot bear to travel in a compartment full of people smoking.\",\n",

But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in.  I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I  should be able to render the greatest service to the country through  the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre  of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field  for the revival of the cottage industry of hand-spinning.  The question of untouchability was naturally among the subjects  discussed with the Ahmedabad friends.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad. Jivanlal Desai, a  barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me.  At the same time there came a letter from Shrimati Anasuyabai about  the condition of labour in Ahmedabad. So I seized  the first opportunity to go to Ahmedabad.  Whilst the Kheda peasants' question was still being discussed, I had already  taken up the question of the mill-hands in Ahmedabad.\",\n",

To levy a yearly tax of Â£12 from a  family of four â€“ husband, wife and two children â€“ when the average  income of the husband was never more than 14s.  We organized a fierce campaign against this tax. It may be possible that the Indian Government had  disapproved of the Â£25 tax from the beginning and reduced it to Â£3,  irrespective of the opposition from the Congress.

I  realized that in refusing to take a vow man was drawn into  temptation, and that to be bound by a vow was like a passage from  libertinism to a real monogamous marriage. 'But supposing my views  are changed in the future, how can I bind myself by a vow.After full discussion and mature deliberation I took the vow in 1906. I  had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only  consulted her at the time of taking the vow.  As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow, I am  filled with pleasure and wonderment. But the  freedom and joy that came to me after taking the vow had never been  experienced before 1906. Before the vow I had been open to being  overcome by temptation at any moment. Now the vow was a sure shield  against temptation. The great potentiality of brahmacharya  daily became more an more patent to me. The vow was taken when I was  in Phoenix. As though  unknown to me, the brahmacharya vow had been preparing me for it. I had cut down my heavy household expenses at  Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take, as it were, the  brahmacharya vow.  The knowledge that a perfect observance of brahmacharya  means realization of brahman,  I did not owe to a study of the Shastras. Every day of the vow has taken me nearer the knowledge that  in brahmacharya lies the protection of the body, the mind and the soul. For brahmacharya  was now no process of hard penance, it was a matter of consolation  and joy.  Control of the palate is the first essential in the observance of  the vow. As the result of these experiments I saw that the brahmachari's  food should be limited, simple, spiceless, and, if possible, uncooked.  Six years of experiment have showed me that the brahmachari's  ideal food is fresh fruit and nuts. Brahmacharya needed no effort on my part in South Africa when I lived on fruits  and nuts alone. It is enough to observe here  that I have not the least doubt that milk diet makes the  brahmacharya vow difficult to observe. Let no one deduce from this that all brahmacharis must give up milk. The effect on  brahmacharya of different kinds of food can be determined only after numerous  experiments.  As an external aid to brahmacharya,  fasting is as necessary as selection and restriction in diet. But it may be said that extinction of the sexual passion is  as a rule impossible without fasting, which may be said to be  indispensable for the observance of brahmacharya. Many  aspirants after brahmacharya fail because in the use of their  other senses they want to carry on like those who are not brahmacharis. There  should be a clear line between the life of a brahmachari and  of one who is not. Both  use their eyesight, but whereas the brahmachari uses it to see the  glories of God, the other uses it to see the frivolity around him. Brahmacharya means control of the senses in thought, word and  deed. There is no limit  to the possibilities of renunciation, even as there is none to those  of brahmacharya. Such brahmacharya is impossible of attainment by  limited effort. An  aspirant after brahmacharya will always be conscious of his  shortcomings, will seek out the passions lingering in the innermost  recesses of his heart and will incessantly strive to get rid of  them. So long as thought is not under complete control of the will, brahmacharya in its fullness is absent.  But it was after coming to India that I realized that such brahmacharya  was impossible to attain by mere human effort. Meanwhile let me make it clear that those  who desire to observe brahmacharya with a view to realizing God need not despair, provided their faith  in God is equal to their confidence in their own effort.\",\n",

But it was  in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing brahmacharya even with respect to my wife. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. At a later  stage more changes were introduced for the sake of supporting brahmacharya. Books on vegetarianism strengthened the idea, but so long  as I had not taken the brahmacharya vow I could not make up my mind to forego milk.  I must here utter a warning for the aspirants of brahmacharya.  Though I have made out an intimate connection between diet and brahmacharya,  it is certain that mind is the principal thing.',\n",

So now I began complete  fasting, allowing myself only water.  I have purposely digressed in the midst of this chapter on fasting,  as I could not have given these pleasant reminiscences anywhere  else, and I have indirectly described a characteristic of mine,  namely that I have always loved to have my co-workers with me in  anything that has appealed to me as being good.

Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it is undertaken  with a view to self-restraint.

That being so,  before restarting civil disobedience on a mass scale, it would be  necessary to create a band of well-tried, pure-hearted volunteers  who thoroughly understood the strict conditions of Satyagraha.  With these thoughts filling my mind I reached Bombay, raised a corps  of Satyagrahi volunteers through the Satyagraha Sabha there, and  with their help commenced the work of educating the people with  regard to the meaning and inner significance of Satyagraha.

If I proceeded without the  necessary permission, I should not be allowed to cross the boundary  of the Punjab, but left to find what satisfaction I could from civil  disobedience. As things  stood, to break the order against my entry into the Punjab could, it  seemed to me, hardly be classed as civil disobedience, for I did not  see around me the kind of peaceful atmosphere that I wanted, and the  unbridled repression in the Punjab had further served to aggravate  and deepen the feelings of resentment. I therefore decided not to proceed  to the Punjab in spite of the suggestion of friends. Tales of rank injustice and oppression came  pouring in daily from the Punjab, but all I could do was to sit  helplessly by and gnash my teeth.
