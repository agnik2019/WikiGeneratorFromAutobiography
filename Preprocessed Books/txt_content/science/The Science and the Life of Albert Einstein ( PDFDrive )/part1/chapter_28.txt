Epilogui
I saw Einstein for the last time in December 1954.
As he had not been well, he had for some weeks been absent from the Institute,
where he normally spent a few hours each morning. Since I was about to take a
term's leave from Princeton, I called Helen Dukas and asked her to be kind
enough to give my best wishes to Professor Einstein. She suggested I come to the
house for a brief visit and a cup of tea. I was, of course, glad to accept. After I
arrived, I went upstairs and knocked at the door of Einstein's study. There was
his gentle 'Come.' As I entered, he was seated in his arm chair, a blanket over his
knees, a pad on the blanket. He was working. He put his pad aside at once and
greeted me. We spent a pleasant half hour or so; I do not recall what was dis-
cussed. Then I told him I should not stay any longer. We shook hands, and I said
goodbye. I walked to the door of the study, not more than four or five steps away.
I turned around as I opened the door. I saw him in his chair, his pad back on his
lap, a pencil in his hand, oblivious to his surroundings.
He was back at work.

Of Tensors and a Hearing Aid
and Many Other Things:
Einstein's Collaborators
All of Einstein's major papers are his alone. However, over the years he had a
remarkably large number, more than thirty, of co-workers. Einstein did not like
crowds, never cared for teaching classes, and did not create a school. But he loved
to talk physics, as was illustrated in such delightful ways during the session of the
Einstein symposium in Princeton devoted to 'working with Einstein' [Wl]. The
four men who reminisced on that occasion had all worked with him during the
1930s and 1940s. Their respective collaborative efforts all dealt with general rel-
ativity and unified field theory, Einstein's exclusive interests during that period.
All of them were men much younger than Einstein who had come to him in the
formative stages of their development.
It was not quite like that in earlier times. Along with the younger physicists
who came even in those days, Einstein also had collaborators who belonged to his
own generation, men like Laub, the Habicht brothers, Grossmann, Ehrenfest,
Bucky, Miihsam, and Tolman. Pauli, though twenty years younger than Einstein,
was already a mature physicist when he and Einstein wrote a joint paper. Fur-
thermore, in the early days, even though relativity was already a main topic of
concern, there was a greater variety of research subjects that interested Einstein.
For example, he is the co-author of experimental papers dealing with refrigera-
tors, a hearing aid, gyromagnetism, and the permeability of membranes for col-
loids. It would appear that in the early years Einstein had more fun.
To understand Einstein the physicist, it would be of some interest to organize
a reunion, albeit on paper only, of all his collaborators.* It is the purpose of this
appendix to do so. The format will be a series of thumb-nail sketches in which
the nature of the various collaborations are stated and in which it is indicated what
became of the people who worked with Einstein.**
*I believe but cannot certify that the list of collaborators given in what follows is complete. I do not
include men such as Besso, with whom Einstein had important scientific discussions not accompanied
or followed by a joint enterprise.

7. Jakob Johann Latib. b. 1872, Jagerndorf, Austria. PhD with W. Wien in
Wiirzburg, November, 1906. Laub published on special relativity as early as 1907
[LI]. At the beginning of 1908, he wrote to Einstein in Bern, asking if he could
work with him [L2]. The resulting collaboration led to two papers on the electro-
dynamics of ponderable media [El, E2].* In 1910, Laub wrote the first major
review article on the experimental basis of special relativity [L3]. He became pro-
fessor of physics in La Plata, Argentina. Later, he joined the Foreign Service of
Argentina and was the Argentinian ambassador to Poland at the time of the Ger-
man invasion in 1939. d. 1962, Fribourg, Switzerland.
2. Walter Ritz. b. 1878, Sion, Switzerland. PhD in Goettingen with Voigt,
1902. Privatdozent in Goettingen from 1908, the year in which he discovered the
combination principle for line spectra. Ritz did not accept special relativity, but
rather believed in the need to give up the notion of a field described by partial
differential equations (see [P2], Sec. 3). Ritz and Einstein published one very brief
joint paper, written in April 1909. I stretch the notion of collaboration by includ-
ing it, since it is a tersely phrased joint communique in which both men state what
they have agreed to differ on. The issue was whether advanced and retarded solu-
tions of the electromagnetic field equations are both admissible types of solutions.
'Ritz considers the restriction to the . .. retarded potentials as one of the roots of
the second law [of thermodynamics], whereas Einstein believes that the irrevers-
ibility rests exclusively on probability grounds' [Rl]. The life of Ritz, a gifted
man, was short and beset with much illness, d. 1909, Goettingen.
3. and 4. The Habicht Brothers. Johann Conrad, b. 1876, and Franz Paul,
b. 1884, both in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.** Conrad was one of the members of
the Akademie Olympia in Bern. He obtained a doctorate in mathematics in 1903,
then became a high school teacher, first in Schiers (Graubiinden), then in
Schaffhausen, where he died in 1958. Paul, an engineer, founded a small factory
for the production of electrical and acoustical equipment. He, too, died in
Schaffhausen, in 1948.
As the result of a note on voltage fluctations in a condenser, 'a phenomenon
similar to Brownian motion' [E3], that Einstein wrote in 1907, he became inter-
ested in the possibility of amplifying small voltage differences. He conceived the
idea of using for this purpose a condenser with variable capacity which is charged
at low voltage and maximum capacity, then discharged at a higher voltage and at
minimum capacity into another condenser. This process was to be repeated with
the help of a set of condensers coupled in series. It was his hope that this electro-
static device might be of use for research in radioactivity. In December 1907 Ein-
stein wrote to Conrad that Paul planned to build this 'Maschinchen,' (little
machine), as Einstein always affectionately called it, in his own laboratory. Ein-
*These papers are discussed in [P2], Sees. 33,35.

stein was quite excited about his invention, and at one time must have even con-
sidered patenting it. 'I am very curious how much can be achievedâ€”I have rather
high hopes. I have dropped the patent, mainly because of the lack of interest of
the manufacturer [?]' [E4]. A few months later, he published his proposal [E5]
and in 1908 tried to construct his own Maschinchen [E6]. In 1910 the Habicht
brothers published the results of experiments 'performed together with A. Einstein
at the laboratory of the University of Zurich,' in which Einstein's idea was real-
ized with the help of a set of six rotating condensers [H2]. Einstein still continued
to take a lively interest in the project after his own work had gone in other direc-
tions. In 1911 [E7] and again in 1912 [E8], he wrote from Prague to Besso about
the great success Paul had had in demonstrating the apparatus in Berlin.
Rapid advances in amplification technology overtook Einstein's design, how-
ever. After Paul's death in 1948, Einstein wrote to Conrad, 'The memory awakens
of old days in which I worked with your brother on the .. . little machine.... It
was wonderful [Schon war es], even though nothing useful came of it' [E9].
5. Ludwig Hopf. b. 1884, Niirnberg. PhD with Sommerfeld in 1909. Hopf
met Einstein in September 1909 at the Salzburg physics meeting and soon joined
him at the University of Zurich as his assistant. Together they wrote two papers
on classical statistical aspects of radiation, including the problem of the motion of
a resonator in a radiation field [E10, Ell]. Hopf arranged a meeting between
Einstein and Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst [SI]. In 1911 Hopf accompanied Ein-
stein to Prague. Later that year he accepted an assistantship at the Technische
Hochschule in Aachen, where he eventually became a professor in hydrodynamics
and aerodynamics. He did important work in these fields, contributed to the
Handbuch der Physik [H3], and was co-author of a highly esteemed textbook on
aerodynamics [Fl]. He lost his position at Aachen in 1934 because he was a non-
Aryan. Soon thereafter he moved to Dublin as professor of mathematics at Trinity
College, d. 1939, Dublin.
6. Emil Nohel. Assistant to Einstein in Prague. Nothing is recorded about
him in the literature except for a few brief comments in the biography by Philipp
Frank: 'Nohel . . . was the son of a small Jewish farmer, and as a boy he walked
behind the plow. He had the quiet poise of a peasant rather than the nervous
personality so often found among the Jews . ..' [F2]. I am grateful to Y. Nohel
from Haifa for providing me with more details about his father. With his per-
mission, I quote from his letter to me [Nl].
Emil Nohel was born in the small Czech village of Mcelly, the son of a farmer.*
He received a German education in Prague, where he entered the German Uni-
versity in 1904. Anton Lampa, the professor of experimental physics in Prague,
advised the young student not to take physics as a main subject 'since all the orig-
inal work had already been done, the laws had been established, and important
new developments were not be be expected.' Nohel therefore took mathematics as
*In the 1860s, it became legal for Jews to acquire land in that region.
486 APPENDICES
his major subject and physics as a secondary subject. After Einstein arrived in
Prague, he took Nohel as his assistant upon Lampa's recommendation. There is
no record of Nohel's subsequent research. 'The many hours Einstein and my
father spent together in Einstein's study, his world view and character left a lasting
impression on my father. .. . He was fond of Einstein's first wife and regretted
their separation.' Nohel got his PhD in 1912 or 1913. After Einstein's return to
Zurich, Nohel became a mathematics teacher at the Handelsakademie in Vienna,
a post he retained until the Anschluss of 1938. From 1938 to 1940 he was first a
teacher, then the principal of the Ghayes Gymnasium, the only remaining sec-
ondary school which Jewish children could attend in Vienna. In 1942 he was
interned in Theresienstadt (Teresin). He is mentioned in studies of life in the
camp as being active in educational work. After the rest of his family died in
Teresin, he voluntarily joined his sister upon deportation to the extermination
camps. Letters by Nohel to his son were deposited in the Yad va-Shem Memorial
Archives in Jerusalem. Einstein attempted to help Nohel but without success
[E12].
7. Otto Stern, b. 1888, Sohrau, upper Silesia, (now Zory in Poland). PhD in
1912 in physical chemistry with Otto Sackur in Breslau. Stern came to Prague
with his own independent means to join Einstein and accompanied him to Zurich
when Einstein took up his position at the ETH. Einstein and Stern wrote a joint
paper dealing with an attempt (unsuccessful) to interpret anomalies in the specific
heats of gases at low temperatures [E13]. Helped by Einstein's advocacy, Stern
became Privatdozent in Zurich in 1913. The next year he moved to Frankfurt,
where the Stern-Gerlach experiments were performed in 1920-2. His discovery
of the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton was made in Hamburg in 1933.
Stern left Germany after the Nazis came to power, to become research professor
of physics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity) in Pittsburgh. In 1944 he received the 1943 Nobel prize in physics 'for
his contributions to the molecular ray method and the discovery of the magnetic
moment of the proton.' After his retirement in 1946, he divided his time between
Berkeley and Zurich. When Jost and I visited him in Berkeley in the early 1960s,
he told us with tears in his eyes of the beautiful days with Einstein in Prague.*
d. 1969, Berkeley.
8. Marcel Grossmann. b. 1878, Budapest. Fellow student of Einstein at the
ETH, 1896-1900. PhD in 1902 with Fiedler in Zurich. Grossmann and his
father were instrumental in getting Einstein appointed to the patent office in Bern.
In 1905 Einstein dedicated his PhD thesis to the younger Grossmann. The Ein-
stein-Grossmann collaboration is discussed at length in Chapter 12. d. 1936,
Zurich. Einstein remembered Grossmann with gratitude in his last autobiograph-
ical sketch [E14].**

EINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 487
9. Adriaan Daniel Fokker. b. 1887, Buitenzorg, Dutch East Indies, (now
Bogor, Indonesia). PhD in 1913 with Lorentz in Leiden on the Brownian motion
of an electron in a radiation field [F3]. This work led to the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion for Gaussian Markov processes. Fokker worked with Einstein in Zurich dur-
ing the winter semester in 1913-14. Their joint paper on the Nordstrom theory
of gravitation [El5] was discussed in Section 13b. In later years, Fokker wrote
several papers on relativity as well as a Dutch textbook on that subject. He became
the curator of the Teyler Foundation in Haarlem and concurrently held a profes-
sorship at Leiden. He was a passionate advocate of 31-tone music and of the
purity of the Dutch language, d. 1972, Beekbergen, Holland.
70. Wander Johannes de Haas. b. 1878, Lisse, Holland. PhD in 1912 with
Kamerlingh Onnes in Leiden. Soon after obtaining this degree, de Haas and his
wife (nee Geertruida Luberta Lorentz, the oldest of the three children of H. A.
Lorentz) went to Berlin, where he worked first in the laboratory of Henri du Bois
and then with Einstein at the Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt. This led to
the discovery of the Einstein-de Haas effect, as described'in Section 14b. In 1925
de Haas succeeded Kamerlingh Onnes at Leiden. He was a leading and produc-
tive figure in experimental low-temperature physics. He retired from his Leiden
position in 1948. d. 1960, Bilthoven, Holland.
7 7. Jakob Grommer. b. Brest-Litovsk, a Russian town in the year (not known
to me) of Grommer's birth, a Polish town from 1921 to 1939 (Grommer held a
Polish passport at one time), now Brest in the U.S.S.R. As a young man, Grom-
mer devoted himself exclusively to the study of the Talmud.* A burning interest
in mathematics brought him to Goettingen. According to Helen Dukas, Grommer
spoke only Yiddish when he arrived in Germany. In Goettingen 'he aroused the
curiosity of the mathematicians soon after his arrival. In an incredibly short time,
he not only acquired a deep knowledge of mathematics but also managed to write
a doctoral thesis which is considered outstanding by insiders. ... If one considers
that he was disfigured as the result of a malignant disease** and that he was,
moreover, physically weak, then one can appreciate how uncommon the talents
were which this man brought along into this world' [E16].
Grommer worked with Einstein for ten years, the longest period any person
collaborated with him. The first mention of him is in Einstein's 1917 paper on
cosmology [E17]. Six years later, they published a joint paper in which it was
shown that the Kaluza theory does not admit centrally symmetric singularity-free
solutions [E18]. Shortly thereafter, Einstein mentioned Grommer's work again in
one of his own papers [E19]. In 1925 Einstein wrote that Grommer had 'faithfully
assisted me in recent years with all calculations in the area of general relativity
"This was stated by Einstein in a note written in 1953 [E16J at the request of an Israeli committee
that was preparing a book on the history of the Jews of Brest-Litovsk [Cl].
**Grommer suffered from acromegaly. Einstein mentioned that this affliction often made Grommer
irritable.

theory' [E20]. In 1927 they wrote a joint paper on the problem of motion in gen-
eral relativity (see Chapter 15) [E21]. Another acknowledgment [E22] indicates
that Grommer was in Berlin at least as late as 1928. Funds for his support came
in part from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut [K2]. While in Germany, Grommer
worked on the preparation of a mathematics and physics textbook in Hebrew for
use in high schools in Palestine. Weizmann had authorized financial support for
this project [R3]. In the late 1920s, Grommer accepted a university position in
Minsk. In 1929 he wrote to Einstein from Minsk that some of his lectures were
given in Russian, others in Yiddish [Gl]. He was later elected to the Bielorussian
Academy of Sciences in Minsk, d. 1933, Minsk.
12. Paul Ehrenfest. b. 1880, Vienna. PhD in Vienna in 1904 with Boltz-
mann. Ehrenfest first met Einstein in Prague in 1912. Their deep friendship
lasted until Ehrenfest's death. In 1922 they wrote a joint paper on the Stern -
Gerlach effect, in which the pre-quantum mechanical difficulties of understanding
this phenomenon are clearly demonstrated [E23]. Another joint paper, written the
next year, deals with an extension of Einstein's earlier work on spontaneous and
induced emission and absorption of radiation to two-photon states, with an appli-
cation to the Compton effect [E24]. From 1913 to 1933 Ehrenfest was professor
of theoretical physics in Leiden, d. 1933, Amsterdam, by his own hand. 'Paul
Ehrenfest, in memoriam,' one of Einstein's finest and most moving pieces of prose,
was written to honor a friend and 'the best teacher in our profession I have ever
known.'* In this note Einstein shows his great sensitivity to the fate of physics and
physicists.
13. Hans Muhsam ** b. 1876, Berlin. In 1900 Muhsam passed his final med-
ical examinations, started a private practice, and became a staff member at the
Jewish Hospital in Berlin. He first met Einstein in 1915. 'At that time, his name
was little known in lay circles' [Ml]. The meeting came about because of a chance
encounter between the Miihsams and Elsa Einstein. On that occasion Muhsam
told Elsa that he had heard of Albert Einstein and that she, Elsa, had a famous
name. When Einstein heard of this, he became curious and got in touch with the
Miihsams. A friendship developed. The men would go on Sunday hikes during
which they discussed physics and also medical and biological problems [S4].
In 1923 Einstein and Muhsam wrote a joint paper on the experimental deter-
mination of the permeability of filters [ E26]. The purpose of the experiment was
to find the maximum diameter of colloidal particles capable of permeating a given
rigid membrane. The membrane consists of the walls of a tube that is open at one
'Einstein's article on Ehrenfest was originally published in the Almanak van het Leidsche Studen-
tencorps in 1934. Its English version is found in one of his collections of essays [E25].
**I obtained most of the biographical information about Muhsam from letters by him and his wife,
Minna, to Carl Seelig. These letters are now in the Historisch-Wissenschaftliche Sammlung in the
main library of the ETH in Zurich.
EINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 489
end. The open end is connected to an air pump. The empty tube is hung in a bath
of aether (chosen for its low capillary constant a). The aether fills the membrane
pores. The air pump serves to increase the pressure inside the tube until, at a
pressure p, air bubbles begin to appear in the aether. Then p = 4a/d. Here d is
the diameter of the widest membrane pores and is therefore the optimal colloidal
diameter to be determined. The authors record the results of experiments in which
diameters of about 1 /jm were obtained.
The friendship between the two men grew and became very important in Ein-
stein's life. Tor a long period, Einstein visited us daily in Berlin' [M2]. Mrs
Miihsam wrote to Seelig after her husband's death, 'Do you know that Einstein
once said to me, "First comes your husband, then for a long while comes nothing,
and only then come all other people"?' [M3]. I have reasons to believe that
Miihsam became Einstein's closest confidant in the Berlin days. It was to
Miihsam that Einstein told the story of having, at age twelve, composed songs in
honor of God which he would sing to himself on his way to school [S5] (see Chap-
ter 3). When Miihsam once asked what would have become of Einstein if he had
been born the son of poor Russian Jews, Einstein replied that he would probably
have become a rabbi [S6]. Muhsam could have informed us better than anyone
else about personal events which may well have contributed to Einstein's becoming
a figure who went his lonely separate way in physics after 1926.
Einstein and Muhsam kept in touch after the Einsteins had settled in the
United States and the Miihsams had fled from Germany to Israel. A letter from
Einstein in 1942 still shows personal touches: 'I have become a lonely old chap
who is mainly known because he does not wear socks and who is exhibited as a
curiosum on special occasions' [E27]. In that same letter, he also writes about his
work: 'In regard to work, I am more fanatic than ever and really hope to have
solved my old problem of the unity of the physical field. However, it is like an
airship with which one can sail around in the clouds without seeing clearly how
to land in reality, that is, on earth.' Muhsam died in Haifa in 1957.
14. Leo Szilard. b. 1898, Budapest. He went to Berlin for his university
education. 'As soon as it became clear to Szilard that physics was his real interest,
he introduced himself, with characteristic directness, to Albert Einstein. I believe
it was largely Szilard's doing that Einstein gave a seminar on statistical mechan-
ics. . . . The seminar was a unique experience for most participants; it also
inspired, I believe, Szilard's doctoral dissertation' [W2]. PhD in Berlin in 1922
with von Laue. Until 1933 Szilard worked at one of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes
in Berlin. From 1928 to 1933 he was also Privatdozent at the University.
Einstein and Szilard made a considerable number of joint patent applications,
eight German (November 1927-December 1930), six British (December 1927-
December 1929), one U.S. (December 16, 1927), one to Einstein's old patent
office in Bern (December 21, 1928), and one Dutch (December 27, 1928). All
applications were granted except for two of the British ones. All the German pat-
490 APPENDICES
ents were awarded after Einstein had left that country. In 1927 Einstein autho-
rized Szilard to apply in his own name for patents abroad of some of their joint
ventures [E28].
A detailed discussion of these patents is found in Szilard's collected papers
[F4].* Briefly, the task Einstein and Szilard had set for themselves was to devise
a noiseless household refrigerator. Their principal novelty was the so-called Ein-
stein-Szilard pump, later described by Einstein in general terms. 'By means of an
alternating electric current, a magnetic guide field is generated which moves a
liquid mixture of sodium and potassium. This mixture moves in alternating direc-
tions inside a casing and acts as the piston of a pump; the refrigerant [inside the
casing] is thus mechanically liquified and cold is generated by its re-evaporation'
[E29]. It appears that the inventors received a modest amount of money for their
work [S7], but it did not make them rich. 'As it turned out, such refrigerators
were never commercially utilized because of the rapid advances made in mechan-
ical refrigerators which eliminated their objectionable noise, the dangers from
leakage of the poisonous refrigerant, and erratic operation' [F4]. However, there
were other applications. 'For many years there did not appear to be any other
practical use for such pumping systems, but with the advent of atomic energy their
need became evident (first to Szilard), and much effort has since been expended
in their further development' [F4].
In 1933 Szilard went to England. In 1938 he settled in the United States. His
first position was at Columbia University. He then moved to Chicago, where he
participated in the first nuclear reactor project. In 1946 he was appointed profes-
sor of biophysics at the Enrico Fermi Institute in Chicago. 'In his work in biology,
Szilard finally reached his full potential' [W2]. He had a strongly developed
political conscience. On August 2,1939, he and Eugene Wigner called on Einstein
to urge him to bring the need for action on the development of atomic weapons to
the attention of President Roosevelt. This visit led to the letter drafted and signed
by Einstein which was handed to Roosevelt on October 11, 1939. Later, Szilard
suggested that Einstein write a second letter to the president, urging him to speed
up these activities. A letter to this effect was sent on March 7, 1940. d. 1964,
Lajolla, California.
75. Rudolf Goldschmidt.** b. 1876, Neubukow (Mecklenburg-Schwerin),
Germany. Engineering diploma in 1898. From 1899 to 1909, Goldschmidt
worked in England with such electrotechnical firms as Westinghouse. Upon his
return to Germany, he became first Privatdozent, later professor, in Darmstadt.
One of his main achievements was the invention of the high-frequency apparatus
â€¢See also [K3], [M4], and [M5]. The Swiss patent is mentioned in [F5] and [M5], not in [F4].
**I am grateful to Professor Goldschmidt's daugther-in-law Rose Goldie from New Maiden, Surrey,
England, and to Horst Melcher from Potsdam for information which was of great help to me in the
preparation of this note on the Einstein-Goldschmidt patent. I first became aware of this patent

used in the first radiotelegraphic link between Germany and the United States,
opened on June 19, 1914, with an exchange of telegrams between Wilhelm II and
Woodrow Wilson.
In the 1920s, Goldschmidt was director of an industrial research laboratory in
Berlin-Moabit. He held many patents. One of these, German patent 590783, held
jointly with Einstein, has the following history. An acquaintance of Einstein, a
distinguished singer, had become hard of hearing. In 1928 Einstein asked Gold-
schmidt's assistance in developing a new type of hearing aid for her. At that time,
he sent his friend one of his poetic creations:
Ein biszchen Technik dann und wann
Auch Griibler amusieren kann.
Drum kiihnlich denk ich schon so weit:
Wir legen noch ein Ei zu zweit.*
The final patent is entitled 'Device, especially for sound-reproduction equipment,
in which changes of an electric current generate movements of a magnetized body
by means of magnetostriction.' It was issued on January 10, 1934. Einstein's
address is given as 'Earlier in Berlin, present residence unknown.'
Goldschmidt emigrated to England in 1934 and in later years kept up a cor-
respondence with Einstein, d. 1950, Bournemouth, England.
16. Cornelius Lanczos. (born Kornel Loewy, the name later Hungarianized).
b. 1892, Szekesfehervar, Hungary. PhD in 1921 with Rudolf Ortvay in Szeged.
Lanczos corresponded with Einstein from 1919 on and had already written over
a dozen papers on general relativity when he came to work with Einstein. In 1928,
Einstein wrote to Erwin Madelung in Frankfurt am Main, asking if it would be
possible for Lanczos to have a year's leave of absence from his position as an
assistant and Privatdozent at the University of Frankfurt in order to work with
Einstein on problems in unified field theory [E30]. A week later, Lanczos wrote
to Einstein, 'Young Bethe is being considered as my deputy' [L4]. Lanczos arrived
in Berlin in November 1928 for a one-year period. There are no joint papers.
Einstein refers to Lanczos' work in one of his articles on distant parallelism [E31],
a subject on which Lanczos wrote a review two years later [L5].
Lanczos returned to Frankfurt at the end of 1929. His distinguished career
included a professorship at Purdue (1931-46), a period of work in industry, and,
after 1954, a professorship at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin. He
wrote a number of books, three of which deal with Einstein, his oeuvre, and his
influence [L6, L7, L8]. d. 1974, Budapest.
17. Hermann Miintz. I have only a few biographical notes on Miintz. He
was born in Poland and later became a German citizen [M6]. He corresponded
"In prose translation: A bit of technique now and then/Can also amuse thinkers./Therefore, auda-
ciously I'm thinking far ahead: One day we'll produce something good together.

with Einstein at least as early as 1927. In 1928 Einstein wrote to him on distant
parallelism: 'This mathematically so natural theory is worthy of serious consid-
eration, especially in view of the current desperate state of theoretical physics'
[E32]. Miintz came to work with Einstein during the period Lanczos was there.
Both men were supported by stipends from the Notgemeinschaft Deutscher Wis-
senschaftler [K4].* Einstein acknowledged Miintz's work in two papers on distant
parallelism [E31, E33]. In 1929 Miintz became professor of mathematics at the
University of Leningrad, where he received an honorary doctorate in 1935. After
declining to become a Soviet citizen, Miintz had to leave the Soviet Union in 1937
[M7]. In 1938 he arrived in Sweden. Einstein contacted several Jewish agencies
in attempts to obtain financial support for him. I do not know what became of
him after 1938.
18. Walther Mayer, b. 1887, Graz, Austria. Studied at the ETH in Zurich
and at the universities of Vienna, Paris, and Goettingen. PhD in 1912 in Vienna,
where he became Privatdozent in 1926. In 1929 he completed a book on Rieman-
nian geometry, part of a textbook on differential geometry [Dl].
After the departure of Lanczos and Miintz, Einstein contacted Richard von
Mises in Vienna to ask if he knew of someone interested in working with him. In
December 1929, von Mises recommended Mayer [M8]. The Einstein-Mayer
collaboration started soon after and was at once a success. In January 1930 Ein-
stein requested a stipend for Mayer from the Preussische Akademie [K5]. In Feb-
ruary 1930 they published their first joint paper, on static solutions of the distant
parallelism theory [E34]. Einstein must rapidly have concluded that he wanted to
keep Mayer close to him, for in June he wrote to the mathematician Ludwig
Bieberbach in Berlin, asking if a job for Mayer could be found [E35]. In October
Einstein presented to the Prussian Academy a paper by him and Mayer in which
a new unified field theory was proposed, one based on a four-dimensional space-
time continuum with a five-dimensional tangent space attached at each point
[E36].** Mayer (as well as Helen Dukas) accompanied the Einsteins on their
first trip to California (December 1930-March 1931), since Einstein did not wish
to interrupt the collaboration. Right after their return, a sequel to the October
1930 paper was submitted [E37]. In December 1932 they completed their last
joint paper to be published in Germany. It deals with semi-vectors and spinors
[E38] and was the last paper published by Einstein in the Sitzungsberichte of the
Preussische Akademie.
Meanwhile, in October 1932, Einstein had been appointed professor at The
Institute for Advanced Study with the understanding that his first period in
Princeton would start in October 1933. Throughout the negotiations with Abra-
*This fund existed from 1920 to 1934 under the presidency of Friedrich Schmidt-Ott. Its purpose
was to give financial support to promising young PhD's and Privatdozente who could not manage
to start their academic career without outside aid.
**See Chapter 17.
EINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 493
ham Flexner, the first director of the Institute, Einstein insisted on an appoint-
ment for Mayer as an essential condition for his own acceptance of the new posi-
tion. After other conditions of his professorship had been settled to mutual
satisfaction, Einstein wrote to Flexner, 'Now my only wish is that Herr Dr W.
Mayer, my excellent co-worker, will receive an appointment that is formally inde-
pendent of my own. Until now, he has suffered very much from the fact that his
abilities and achievements have not found their deserved recognition. He must be
made to feel that he is being appointed because of his own achievements and not
for my sake' [E39].
The next two Einstein-Mayer papers again dealt with semi-vectors [E40,
E41]. They were produced during their stay at Le Coq sur Mer in Belgium (see
Section 25b). At that time, the spring of 1933, Mayer's Princeton appointment
had still not been settled, and Einstein wrote to Flexner urging him to exercise
care in the choice of people he might approach for opinions on Mayer [E42]. A
subsequent letter to Flexner shows that Einstein could put the pressure on if he
wanted to: 'You will by now have learned through the press that I have accepted
a chair at Madrid University. ... In view of my relations to the Spanish govern-
ment, I feel it is my duty to write to you about my assistant, Professor W. Mayer.
The Spanish government has conceded me the right to recommend to them a
mathematician to be appointed as full professor under my direction. Now, as I
have very great regard for Professor Mayer's abilities, not only as my collaborator
but also as an independent researcher in pure mathematics whose achievements
are notable and valuable, he would be the right man to take up such a professor-
ship. He would not have thought of asking me to recommend him for this post
had he not felt it as a set-back that he was appointed to your Institute not as a
full professor but only as an associate professor with a salary that hardly corre-
sponds to his merits and his needs. I therefore find myself in a difficult position:
either to recommend him for Spain or to ask you whether you could possibly
extend his appointment to a full professorship. This would be the only way of
retaining him for your Institute and for a collaboration with me. I would deplore
it very much indeed if I were deprived of his valuable collaboration; and his
absence from the Institute might even create some difficulties for my own work.
Besides, his resignation would be a great loss to your Institute' [E43].
The very high importance which Einstein still attached to the collaboration
with Mayer is also evident from his reply to a proposal by Flexner that Mayer
arrive in Princeton some weeks before Einstein would be there: '[This] would
severely impair our joint work . .. [since] we would be torn away from each other
[voneinander gerissen] for a whole month .. .' [E44].
Einstein prevailed, and Mayer was given a tenured position with the title of
associate, the only appointment of its kind ever made by the Institute. The entire
collaboration of Einstein and Mayer in the United States consists of one joint
paper, the last one on semi-vectors [E45]. After 1934 Mayer returned to his own
pursuits in pure mathematics. It is my understanding that he no longer wished to
494 APPENDICES
be associated with work on unified field theory and that he believed his career
would best be furthered by independent work. I knew him during the last years
of his life, a gentle and somewhat diffident figure with an office on the third floor
in Fuld Hall. d. 1948, Princeton.
19. Richard Chase Tolman. b. 1881, West Newton, Massachusetts. PhD in
physical chemistry in 1910 with Arthur Noyes. Professor at California Institute
of Technology 1922. Author of two books on relativity theory [Tl, T2]. During
Einstein's first visit to California, Tolman collaborated with Ehrenfest and Podol-
sky on a study of the gravitational field produced by light [E46] and with Einstein
and Podolsky on a less-than-successful study of the measurement problem in
quantum mechanics [E47]. d. 1948, Pasadena, California.
20. Willem de Sitter, b. 1872, Sneek, Holland. PhD in Groningen with Jaco-
bus Kapteyn. Proposed the 'de Sitter universe' in 1917. Director of the Leiden
astronomical observatory 1919-34. During Einstein's second visit to California,
he published a joint note with de Sitter [E48] in which a cosmologically flat uni-
verse is proposed (without cosmological term and with zero pressure), d. 1934,
Leiden.
21. Boris Podolsky. b. 1896, Taganrog, Russia. Emigrated to the United
States in 1913. PhD with Paul Epstein at CalTech 1928. Podolsky met Einstein
in Pasadena in 1931 and collaborated with him and Tolman. He was in Charkov
in the early 1930s where he worked with Fock and Dirac on quantum electro-
dynamics. He was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-35,
when the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen collaboration took place [E49] (Section 25c).
In this paper, the term wave function is used. I was sure that Einstein had not
done the actual writing, since he would invariably use the expression psi-function
instead. Nathan Rosen told me that the paper was written by Podolsky. Later
Podolsky became research professor at the Xavier University in Cincinnati [D2].
d. 1966, Cincinnati.
22. Nathan Rosen, b. 1909, Brooklyn, New York. ScD at MIT in 1932.
Rosen wrote his master's thesis on distant parallelism and then went to Princeton
to work on theoretical molecular physics.* While in Princeton, he solicited Ein-
stein's opinion on his master's thesis. This contact led to a period of collaboration.
Rosen was a member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1934-5. The first
joint paper was the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen article, the main idea of which
came from Rosen. This was followed two months later by a paper on singularity-
free solutions of the combined gravitational and electromagnetic field [E50]. In
1936 they published a note on the general relativistic two-body problem [E51] and
in 1937 a paper on cylindrical gravitational waves [E52].
In the course of working on this last problem, Einstein believed for some time
that he had shown that the rigorous relativistic field equations do not allow for the
existence of gravitational waves [II, S2]. After he found the mistake in the argu-
*I am indebted to Nathan Rosen for telling me of his experiences.
EINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 495
ment, the final manuscript was prepared and sent to the Physical Review. It was
returned to him accompanied by a lengthy referee report in which clarifications
were requested. Einstein was enraged and wrote to the editor that he objected to
his paper being shown to colleagues prior to publication [E53]. The editor cour-
teously replied that refereeing was a procedure generally applied to all papers
submitted to his journal, adding that he regretted that Einstein may not have been
aware of this custom [T3]. Einstein sent the paper to the Journal of the Franklin
Institute and, apart from one brief note of rebuttal [E54], never published in the
Physical Review again.
The final version of the gravitational wave paper was completed in 1937. At
that time Rosen was in the Soviet Union, where Einstein had helped him to obtain
a temporary position. He had written to Vyacheslev Molotov, at that time the
chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, asking him to facilitate Rosen's
projects [E55]. The little man with the pince-nez must have replied to the good
professor, for shortly afterward Einstein wrote again to Molotov to thank him for
his help [E56]. Since 1952 Rosen has been professor at the Technion in Haifa.
23. Gustav Bucky. b. 1880, Leipzig. Bucky, a physician specializing in radiol-
ogy, met the Einsteins in Berlin in the course of treating Use Kayser-Einstein.
The Buckys and the Einsteins became friends after the two families moved to the
United States. On October 27, 1936, the two men obtained joint patent No.
2,058,562 from the U.S. patent office for a photoelectric device. An open photo-
electric eye in the front of a camera takes in the object to be photographed as the
camera is pointed and automatically moves a screen of varying transparency in
front of the camera lens. d. 1963, New York.
24. Leopold Infeld. b. 1898, Cracow. PhD in 1921 with Ladislas Natanson
in Cracow. In his student days, Infeld once called on Einstein in Berlin [II] and
corresponded with him from 1927 on. In 1934 Einstein wrote an introduction to
a popular scientific book by Infeld [E57]. Infeld was a member of The Institute
for Advanced Study in 1936-7, and he and Einstein wrote three joint articles
[E58, E59, E60] on the problem of motion in general relativity, the first one being
the well-known Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann paper mentioned in Chapter 15. In
1938 Einstein and Infeld wrote The Evolution of Physics, a popular scientific book
written to help Infeld financially [E61]. In his autobiography, Quest, Infeld wrote
about his days with Einstein. Einstein was not enthusiastic about this book. 'One
should not undertake anything which endangers the tenuous bridge of confidence
between people' [E62]. Infeld was professor at the University of Toronto from
1938 to 1950 and at the University of Warsaw from 1950 until his death, d. 1968,
Warsaw.
25. Banesh Hoffmann, b. 1906, Richmond, England. In 1929 Hoffmann
started work on projective relativity with Veblen. PhD in 1932 with Veblen at
Princeton. A member of The Institute for Advanced Study in 1935-7. Hoffmann
co-authored the aforementioned paper with Einstein and Infeld [E58]. He has
been professor at Queens College in New York City since 1952 and is author of
496 APPENDICES
an excellent popular biography of Einstein [H4] and, together with Helen Dukas,
of a book on memorable pronouncements by Einstein [D3].*
26. Peter Gabriel Bergmann. b. 1915, Berlin. PhD in 1936 in Prague with
Philipp Frank, who recommended him to Einstein. Bergmann worked with Ein-
stein from 1936 to 1941. They published two joint papers on the five-dimensional
unification of electromagnetism and gravitation (Kaluza-Klein theory), the second
one in collaboration with Bargmann [E63, E64]. Einstein wrote an introduction
to Bergmann's textbook on relativity [E65]. Since 1950, Bergmann has held a
professorate at Syracuse University.
27. Valentin Bargmann. b. 1908, Berlin, of Russian parents. PhD in 1936
with Gregor Wentzel in Zurich. German citizen from 1925 until deprived of Ger-
man citizenship in 1934. Member of The Institute for Advanced Study 1937-46.
Bargmann and Einstein published two papers together, the one with Bergmann
just mentioned [E64] and a paper on bivectors [E66].** [Bivectors are quantities
Tlir(x^x2), depending on a pair of space-time points, transforming under general
coordinate transformations like the product All(xi)B,(x2), where Au(xt) and B,(x2)
are ordinary 4-vector fields.] Bargmann became professor at the University of
Pittsburg and, afterwards, professor of mathematical physics at Princeton Uni-
versity.
28. Wolfgang Fault, b. 1900, Vienna. PhD in 1921 with Sommerfeld in
Munich. Einstein wrote a laudatory review [E68] of Pauli's review article [P2]
on relativity theory. Pauli spent the years 1940-6 at The Institute for Advanced
Study in order to escape the menaces of war. In 1943 he wrote a joint paper with
Einstein [E69] in which it was proved that any everywhere regular and static
solution of the source-free gravitational equations which behaves at large distances
like a Schwarzschild solution must have a vanishing Schwarzschild mass. (A sim-
ilar theorem was shown to hold in the Kaluza-Klein theory.)!
It will be obvious that this brief comment is not in any way meant to do justice
to Pauli's contributions and influence in regard to relativity theory and relativistic
quantum theory. For a survey of Pauli's oeuvre, see [E71]. d. 1958, Zurich.
29. Ernst Gabor Straus, b. 1922, Munich. Assistant to Einstein 1944-8. At
the time Straus came to work with Einstein, the latter was much interested in the
problem of finding generalizations of general relativity that are not based on dif-
ferential geometry. He also discussed these matters with Pauli at that time. Two
examples of such generalizations (about which Einstein never published) are
found in Straus's reminiscences [Wl]. A joint paper on the influence of the expan-
sion of space on the gravitational fields surrounding individual stars was written
"The reader is urged to read the reminiscences of Hoffmann, Bargmann, Bergmann, and Straus in
[Wl].
"Einstein also wrote a sequel to this paper [E67].
fThis is an improved version of an earlier result obtained by Einstein alone [E70].
EINSTEIN'S COLLABORATORS 497
without awareness of numerous earlier contributions to this subject by others
[E72]. A second paper dealt with asymmetric connections (see Chapter 17) [E73].
In 1948 Straus received his PhD at Columbia University. He is now professor of
mathematics at UCLA.
30. John Kemeny. b. 1926, Budapest. Assistant to Einstein 1948-9. Kemeny
wrote to me, 'When Straus left for the West Coast [in 1948], Einstein was search-
ing for a new assistant. I was introduced to him by mutual friends. . . . He was at
that time in the final stages of publishing unified field theory. He had narrowed
down the search to about three alternative versions of the theory and was trying
to choose amongst them. The year's work resulted in choosing one of the versions,
which he did publish the following year. After he had settled on a particular the-
ory, the next problem clearly was to try to solve the partial differential equations.
That is about as far from my specialty in mathematics as you can get! Therefore
I strongly recommended to Einstein that he not reappoint me but that he get a
specialist' [K6].*
In 1949 Kemeny obtained his PhD in mathematics at Princeton University,
where he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy in 1951. Since 1970 he
has been president of Dartmouth College.
31. Robert Harry Kraichnan. b. 1928, Philadelphia. PhD in 1949 at MIT
with H. Feschbach. Assistant to Einstein in 1949-50. At present, an independent
consultant.
32. Bruria Kaufman, b. 1928, New York City. PhD in 1947 at Columbia
University. Assistant to J. von Neumann at The Institute for Advanced Study,
1947-8. Assistant to Einstein from 1950 until Einstein's death in April 1955. (In
March 1955, Einstein had recommended an extension of her assistantship to
June, 1956 [E74].)
Kaufman was Einstein's last collaborator. She and Einstein wrote two joint
papers, both dealing with asymmetric connections [E75, E76]. The last collabo-
rative effort in Einstein's life was completed in January 1955. After Einstein's
death, Kaufman and Kurt Go'del put in order the scientific papers in Einstein's
office, Room 115 in Fuld Hall. At the Bern conference, later in 1955, Kaufman
gave the final progress report on Einstein's unified field theory program [K8].
Bruria now lives in Kibbutz Mishmar ha'Emek.

How Einstein
got the Nobel Prize
The procedure of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for awarding the Nobel
prize in physics is in outline as follows. Invitations to nominate are sent out by a
five-member Nobel Committee (hereinafter called the Committee) elected from
the membership. This Committee studies the proposals and supporting material,
draws up a protocol of its deliberations, and decides by majority vote on a rec-
ommendation to the Academy. The recommendation is then transmitted in the
form of a report (hereinafter called the Report) that summarizes the merits of the
proposals handed to the Committee and gives the reasons for its decision. The
recommendation is voted on first by the Academy Klass (section) of physics. Then
follows the decisive vote by the Academy in plena (not just the physicists). These
votes need not agree with the Committee's recommendation. For example, in 1908
the Committee unanimously proposed Planck. The Klass vote was also in support
of Planck. But the Academy chose Lippmann.
The case of Planck sheds additional light on the controversial nature of the
quantum theory in its early days. 'This suggestion [ Planck] got a rough treatment
in the Academy. .. . After the defeat in 1908, the Committee had gotten "cold
feet" as far as Planck was concerned. Also, of course, the importance but also the
contradictions of quantum theory came more into focus from around 1910 on,
[and] so the award to Planck was postponed in the hope that the difficulties of the
quantum theory could be sorted out' [Nl].
It was my privilege to be given access to Committee Reports and letters of pro-
posal bearing on Einstein's Nobel prize. Once more, I thank all those in authority
for entrusting me with this material, especially Professor Bengt Nagel, who was
kind enough to answer additional questions.
The Academy's decisions have nearly always been well received by the com-
munity of physicists. To be sure, eyebrows (including my own) are raised on
occasion. That, however, is not only inevitable but also irrelevant to the account
about to be given. My sole focus will be upon matters of great historical interest:
the scientific judgments of leading physicists who made the proposals and the judg-

ment of a highly responsible, rather conservative body of great prestige, the Com-
mittee. The story has neither heroes nor culprits.
On November 10, 1922, a telegram was delivered to the Einstein residence in
Berlin. It read, 'Nobelpreis fur Physik ihnen zuerkannt naheres brieflich [signed]
Aurivillius.'* On that same day, a telegram with the identical text must have been
received by Bohr in Copenhagen. Also on that day, Professor Christopher Auri-
villius, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote to Einstein: 'As I have
already informed you by telegram, in its meeting held yesterday the Royal Acad-
emy of Sciences decided to award you last year's [1921] Nobel prize for physics,
in consideration of your work on theoretical physics and in particular for your
discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, but without taking into account the
value which will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these
are confirmed in the future' [Al]. Bohr had been awarded the physics prize for
1922.
Einstein was not home to receive the telegram or the letter. He and Elsa were
on their way to Japan. In September, von Laue had written to him, 'According
to information I received yesterday and which is certain, events may occur in
November which might make it desirable for you to be present in Europe in
December. Consider whether you will nevertheless go to Japan' [LI]. Einstein
left anyway and would not be back in Berlin until March 1923. Recall that the
previous three years had been a hectic period in his life.** In January 1919, he
and Mileva divorced. At that time, he promised that he would give her the money
he was to receive when his Nobel prize came. In 1923 the entire 121 572 Kroner
and 54j0re (about $32 000 or SF 180 000 in 1923 money) was indeed transmitted
to her.f In June 1919, he married Elsa; in November there was the excitement
about the bending of light. In 1920 his integrity and his work came under attack
from some German quarters. In 1921 he traveled to the United States and
England. Early in 1922 he visited France. Rathenau was murdered just a few
months before Einstein set out for Japan, glad to absent himself for a while from
a potentially dangerous situation. The news of the award must have reached him
while he was en route. I do not know, however, when and where he received word.
The travel diary he kept during that journey makes no mention of this event.
On December 10, 1922, Rudolf Nadolny, the German ambassador to Sweden,
accepted the Nobel prize in Einstein's name and, in a toast offered at the banquet
held in Stockholm that evening, expressed 'the joy of my people that once again
one of them has been able to achieve something for all mankind.' To this he added
*N.p. for physics awarded to you more by letter.
"See Chapter 16.

'the hope that also Switzerland, which during many years provided the scholar a
home and opportunities to work, will participate in this joy' [L2].
Nadolny's report to the Foreign Office in Berlin, sent two days later, shows that
he had conscientiously coped with a problem in international relations. In Novem-
ber he had been asked by the Swedish Academy to represent Einstein. Next the
Swiss ambassador had asked for clarification since, to his knowledge, Einstein was
a Swiss citizen. On December 1, Nadolny cabled the University of Berlin for
information. On December 4 he received a telegram from the Prussian Academy:
'Antwort: Einstein ist Reichsdeutscher.' On December 11 the Foreign Office
informed him that Einstein was Swiss. On January 13, 1923, the Prussian Acad-
emy informed the Kultusministerium in Berlin that on May 4,1920, Einstein had
taken the oath as a state official and was therefore German, since only Germans
can be state officials. The protocol of the Prussian Academy of January 18 quotes
the legal opinion that Einstein was a German citizen but that his Swiss citizenship
was not thereby invalidated. On February 15 the Prussian Academy informed
Einstein of this ruling. On March 24 Einstein wrote to the Prussian Academy
that he had made no change in citizenship status as a condition for his position in
Berlin. On June 19 Einstein called in person on Ministerialrat Rottenburg and
reiterated his position, noting that he traveled on a Swiss passport. A note on this
visit, prepared by Einstein on February 7, 1924, for inclusion in the Acta of the
Prussian Academy reads in part, '[R.] was of the decided opinion that my appoint-
ment to the Akademie implies that I have acquired Prussian citizenship, since the
opposite opinion cannot be maintained on the basis of the Acta. I have no objec-
tions to this view.'* Meanwhile, on April 6, 1923 Use Einstein had written to the
Nobel Foundation in Stockholm that Professsor Einstein would appreciate it if the
medal and diploma could be sent to him in Berlin, adding that if this were to be
done via diplomatic channels 'The Swiss Embassy should be considered, since Pro-
fessor Einstein is a Swiss citizen' [El]. The end of the affair came when Baron
Ramel, the Swedish ambassador to Germany, called on Einstein in Berlin and
handed him his insignia.
In March 1923 Svante Arrhenius, one of the Committee members, wrote to
Einstein suggesting that the latter not wait until December for his visit to Sweden
but that he come in July. He could then attend a meeting of the Scandinavian
Society of Science in Goteborg on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the
founding of that city. Arrhenius left to Einstein the choice of topic for a general
lecture, 'but it is certain that one would be most grateful for a lecture about your
relativity theory' [A2]. Einstein replied that he was agreeable to this suggestion,
though he would have preferred to speak on unified field theory [E2]. On a very
hot day in July, Einstein, dressed in black redingote, addressed an audience of
about two thousand in the Jubilee Hall in Goteborg on 'basic ideas and problems
of the theory of relativity' [E3]. King Gustav V, who was present, had a pleasant

chat with Einstein afterward [HI]. Einstein later gave a second, more technical
lecture at Chalmers Technical Institute for about fifty members of the Science
Society.
I turn next to the labors of the Committee.
The records of the Committee show that Einstein received nominations for the
physics prize for each of the years 1910 through 1922 except for 1911 and 1915.
In order to facilitate its task, the Committee often divides the nominees into more
specialized categories, the purpose being to identify the leading candidate for each
category and then to compare these leading candidates only. For each year in the
following synopsis, I give the name of the category that Einstein was included in,
the company joining him in that category, and, in parentheses, the winner of the
year.
1910. Investigations of a theoretical or mathematical-physical character.
Gullstrand, Planck, Poincare; (Van der Waals).
(Poincare had been nominated on several earlier occasions. The exceptionally
high number (thirty-four) of signatories to letters nominating Poincare in 1910
was the result of a campaign mounted by Mittag Leffler. Some physicists also
signed: M. Brillouin, M. Curie, Lorentz, Michelson, and Zeeman. In its Report,
the Committee noted that neither Poincare's brilliant mathematical contributions
nor his mathematical-philosophical essays (especially mentioned by many nomi-
nators) could be designated discoveries or inventions within physics 'unless one
gives these concepts an especially broad interpretation.')
7977. Einstein is not nominated; (Wien).
7972. Theoretical physics. Heaviside, Lorentz, Mach, Planck; (Dalen).
(Lorentz, who shared the 1902 prize with Zeeman, was nominated by Wien for
a prize to be shared with Einstein. Mach was nominated by Ferdinand Braun,
who shared the 1909 prize with Marconi for his practical contributions to wireless
telegraphy. Poincare, now in another category, was nominated only by Darboux.)
1913. Theoretical physics. Lorentz, Nernst, Planck; (Kamerlingh Onnes).
(Count Zeppelin and the Wright brothers were nominated in other categories.)
1914. Work of a more speculative nature, theoretical physics. Eotvos, Mach,
Planck; (von Laue).
(Mach was nominated by Ostwald.)
7975. Einstein is not nominated; (father and son Bragg share the prize).
7976. Molecular physics. Debye, Knudsen, Lehmann, Nernst. The 1916
physics prize was never awarded.
7977. Investigations connected with Planck's extremely fruitful researches
concerning the quantum hypothesis. Bohr, Debye, Nernst, Planck, Sommerfeld;
(prize deferred).
(Bohr appears for the first time, nominated by Chwolson from Petrograd for a
prize to be shared with Knudsen.)
506 APPENDICES
1918. Quantum physics. Bohr, Paschen, Planck, Sommerfeld; (prize deferred;
1917 prize goes to Barkla).
7979. Theoretical physics. Knudsen, Lehmann, Planck; (Stark; also, 1918
prize goes to Planck).
7920. Mathematical physics. Bohr, Sommerfeld; (Guillaume).
7927. Same as 1920; (prize deferred).
7922. Einstein is not categorized. On November 9 Einstein is awarded the
1921 prize, Bohr the 1922 prize.
Who nominated Einstein? On what grounds? How did the Committee
respond ?
The first to propose Einstein was the physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, to
whom Einstein had unsuccessfully applied for an assistantship in the spring of
1901 (see Chapter 3). Ostwald, winner of the chemistry prize for 1909, the only
one to propose Einstein for 1910, repeated his nominations for the 1912 and 1913
awards. In all three instances, his sole motivation was relativity (until further
notice, relativity shall refer to the special theory). In 1910 he wrote that relativity
was the most far-reaching new concept since the discovery of the energy principle
[Ol]. In his second nomination, he stressed that relativity frees man from bonds
many thousands of years old [O2]. On the third occasion, he emphasized that the
issues were of physical rather than of philosophical principle (as others had sug-
gested) and likened Einstein's contributions to the work of Copernicus and Dar-
win [O3]. For the 1912 Einstein nomination, Ostwald was joined by E. Prings-
heim, C. Schaefer, and W. Wien; for 1913 again by Wien and by Bernhard Nau-
nyn, a German professor of medicine. All these nominations were for relativity
only, though Naunyn added a remark on the quantum theory. Pringsheim wrote,
'I believe that the Nobel Committee will rarely have the opportunity of awarding
a prize for works of similar significance' [PI].
Wien's two nominations were actually for a prize to be shared by Einstein and
Lorentz (and Schaefer proposed either Einstein or else a sharing between Einstein
and Lorentz). It is important to quote again* from Wien's second letter of nomi-
nation. 'Concerning the new experiments on cathode rays and beta rays, I would
not consider them to have decisive power of proof. The experiments are very sub-
tle, and one cannot be sure whether all sources of error have been excluded' [Wl].
At issue was the verification of Einstein's relation between the rest mass, the
energy, and the velocity of a free electron. As was discussed in Chapter 7, by 1908
some experimentalists were already claiming confirmation of the Einstein relation.
Doubts remained, however, as Wien's letter shows; these were not dispelled until
about 1915. Thus, one important confirmation of relativity became noncontro-
versial only after the 1912 nominations had been made. Sommerfeld's theory of
the fine structure of spectral lines, in which essentially the same Einstein relation
is used, also came later, in 1916. By then, the momentous new development of
general relativity had drastically changed the situation.
*I mentioned these same phrases in Section 7e.
HOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 507
Before turning in more detail to the later nominations, I first note the reactions
of the Committee to the earlier ones. In the Report for 1910, it was suggested that
one should wait for further experimental verification 'before one can accept the
[relativity] principle and in particular award it a Nobel prize. This [need for fur-
ther confirmation] is presumably the reason why only now [my italics] Einstein
was proposed, though the principle in question was put forward in 1905 and
caused the liveliest stir.' The Committee also noted that Einstein's work on
Brownian motion had gained him great recognition. The comments on relativity
in the Report for 1912 are similar to those in the Report for 1910. 'Lorentz was
undoubtedly more cautious with his hypotheses than Einstein,' it is noted. In the
Report for 1913 is found a remark that relativity is on its way to becoming a
serious candidate for the award even though (the Committee notes) there may be
considerable doubt about likening Einstein to Copernicus or Darwin. I leave my
own comments on this period until later except for registering my lack of surprise
at not finding Lorentz among those who nominated Einstein for special relativity.
During the next few years, there was an inevitable lull. Einstein was deeply
immersed in the struggle with general relativity and was confusing everybody,
including himself, with his hybrid theory in which everything was covariant
except the gravitational field equations. In 1914 he was nominated by Naunyn
(relativity, diffusion, gravitation) and by Chwolson (contributions to several
domains in theoretical physics). The Report for 1914 notes vaguely that it may
take a long time before the last word is said about Einstein's theory of relativity
and his other work. He was not nominated for the 1915 prize. For 1916 there
was only one letter. Ehrenhaft proposed him for Brownian motion and for special
and general relativity. It is observed in the Report that this last work is not yet
complete.
The upswing started, slowly, with the nominations for 1917. A. Haas proposed
Einstein for the new theory of gravitation, quoting the explanation of the peri-
helion precession of Mercury. E. Warburg nominated him for his work in quan-
tum theory, relativity theory, and gravitation. The third and last letter that year,
by Pierre Weiss from Zurich, is the finest nomination for Einstein ever written
[W2]. For the first time we find an appreciation of the whole Einstein, whose
work represents 'un effort vers la conquete de 1'inconnu.' The letter first describes
Einstein's work in statistical mechanics centering on Boltzmann's principle, then
the two axioms of special relativity, next the light-quantum postulate and the pho-
toelectric effect, then the work on specific heats. It concludes by noting Einstein's
experimental efforts. The Report for 1917 refers to 'the famous theoretical phys-
icist Einstein,' speaks highly of his work, but concludes with a new experimental
snag: The measurements of C. E. St John at Mount Wilson had not found the
red shift predicted by general relativity. 'It appears that Einstein's relativity the-
ory, whatever its merits in other respects may be, does not deserve a Nobel prize.'
1918. Warburg and Ehrenhaft repeat their earlier nomination; Wien and von
Laue independently propose a shared prize for Lorentz and Einstein for relativity;
Edgar Meyer from Zurich cites Brownian motion, specific heats, and gravitation;
508 APPENDICES
Stefan Meyer from Vienna cites relativity (from now on, relativity refers to the
special and the general theory). The Report is in essence identical with that of the
year before.
1919. Warburg, von Laue, and E. Meyer repeat their earlier nomination.
Planck nominates Einstein for general relativity since '[he] made the first step
beyond Newton' [P2]. Arrhenius nominates Einstein for Brownian motion. Per-
rin, Svedberg, and Gouy, all of them major contributors to experiments on Brown-
ian motion, are also put in nomination. The Report goes in detail into statistical
problems, including Einstein's PhD thesis and its correction as well as his work
on critical opalescence. However, it is noted, Einstein's statistical papers are not
of as high a caliber as his work on relativity and quantum physics. 'It would
undoubtedly appear peculiar to the learned world if Einstein were to receive the
prize for [statistical physics] . .. and not for his other major papers.' It is suggested
that one should wait for clarification of the red shift problemâ€”and for the solar
eclipse of May 29!
1920. Warburg repeats his earlier nomination; Waldeyer-Hartz from Berlin
and L. S. Ornstein from Utrecht cite general relativity. A letter dated January 24,
1920, signed by Lorentz, Julius, Zeeman, and Kamerlingh Onnes stresses the
theory of gravitation. The successes of the perihelion motion and the bending of
light are emphasized. It is suggested that the red shift experiments are so delicate
that no firm conclusions should be drawn yet. Einstein 'has placed himself in the
first rank of physicists of all time.' Lorentz was deeply impressed by the results
of the 1919 eclipse expeditions. A few months earlier, he had described these to
Ehrenfest as 'one of the most brilliant confirmations of a theory ever achieved'
[L3].
Bohr adds his voice, too, citing Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and
the theory of specific heats, but 'first and foremost' relativity. 'One faces here an
advance of decisive significance for the development of physical research' [Bl].
Appended to the Report for 1920 is a statement by Arrhenius, prepared at the
request of the Committee, on the consequences of general relativity. Arrhenius
noted that the red shift experiments still disagreed with the theory and that criti-
cism had been leveled from various sides against the bending of light results of the
1919 eclipse expeditions. Some of these objections were indeed sensible (for details
and references, see [W3]). Less fortunate was Arrhenius's reference to an alleged
explanation of the perihelion effect based on an alternative theory.* The Com-
mittee concluded that for the time being relativity could not be the basis for the
award.
7927. In a brief, forceful note Planck repeats his nomination of Einstein.
"This was in reference to work by E. Gehrcke, one of the leaders of the 'Arbeitsgemeinschaft
Deutscher Naturforscher' (Chapter 16). As early as 1917 Einstein had pointed out that Gehrcke's
theory is based on contradictory assumptions [E4]. In 1921 Lenard proposed Gehrcke for the Nobel
prize.
HOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 509
Haas and Warburg are also back. General relativity is cited in letters by W. Dal-
lenbach (Baden), Eddington (Cambridge), G. Jaffe and E. Marx (Leipzig), G.
Nordstrom (Helsingfors), W. Walcott (Washington), and O. Wiener (Leipzig).
J. Hadamard (Paris) proposes either Einstein or Perrin. T. Lyman (Harvard)
cites Einstein's contributions to mathematical physics. Eddington writes, 'Einstein
stands above his contemporaries even as Newton did' [E5].
Professor Carl Wilhelm Oseen from the University of Uppsala proposes Ein-
stein for the photoelectric effect.
At this point, the Committee requests that its member Allvar Gullstrand pre-
pare an account of the theory of relativity and that its member Arrhenius do the
same for the photoeffect.
Gullstrand, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Uppsala since
1894, was a scientist of very high distinction. He obtained his medical doctor's
degree in 1890 and became the world's leading figure in the study of the eye as
an optical instrument. In 1960 it was written of him: 'The ophthalmologists con-
sider him to be the man who, next to Helmholtz, contributed more than anyone
else to a mathematical understanding of the human eye as an optical system... .
While making these investigations, he discovered a number of widespread miscon-
ceptions about optical image formation, and, being a fighter, he devoted many of
his later papers to an attempt to destroy these misconceptions' [H2]. In 1910 and
again in 1911, he was proposed for the Nobel prize in physics. 'In 1911 the orig-
inal suggestion from the Committee was that the prize should be given to Professor
A. Gullstrand, Uppsala, "for his work in geometrical optics." Gullstrand had
become a member of the Committee the same year. .. . However, it turned out
that the Committee for Physiology and Medicine had had the same good idea,
giving Gullstrand their prize "for his work on the dioptrics of the eye." So Gull-
strand declined the prize in physics, and the Committee wrote an extra report
(now including Gullstrand among the signers) suggesting Wien for the prize'
[Nl]. Gullstrand was a member of the Committee for physics from 1911 to 1929,
its chairman from 1923"to 1929.
Gullstrand's report, highly critical of relativity, was not a good piece of work.
I quote from its summary, found in the Report for 1921. Concerning the special
theory: 'The effects that are measurable with physical means are, however, so
small that in general they lie below the limits of experimental error.' Also beside
the mark is his finding about the general theory: 'As Gullstrand has shown, the
situation is that it remains unknown until further notice whether the Einstein
theory can at all be brought into agreement with the perihelion experiment [!] of
Le Verrier.' Gullstrand had fallen into the trap (he was not the only one) of
believing that he had shown that the answer for the perihelion effect is coordinate-
dependent. He also expressed the opinion (more reasonable though not very
weighty) that other, long-known deviations from the pure two-body Newtonian
law should be re-evaluated with general relativistic methods before there could be
even an attempt to identify the residual effect to be explained. On May 25, 1921,
51O APPENDICES
he had presented a paper on these considerations, a reprint of which was appended
to his report [Gl].*
The main points of Arrhenius's report were first, that a prize for quantum
theory had just been given (Planck, 1918) and second, that it would be preferable
to give an award to experimentalists if the photoeffect were to be honored.
No prize for physics was given that year.
7922. The list of signatories keeps growing. Ehrenhaft, Hadamard, von Laue,
E. and S. Meyer, Naunyn, Nordstrom, and Warburg are back. There is a beau-
tiful letter from Sommerfeld. M. Brillouin writes, 'Imagine for a moment what
the general opinion will be fifty years from now if the name Einstein does not
appear on the list of Nobel laureates' [B2]. There are also letters from T. de
Donder (Brussels), R. Emden and E. Wagner (Munich), P. Langevin (Paris),
and E. Poulton (Oxford).
Planck proposes to give the prizes for 1921 and 1922 to Einstein and Bohr,
respectively.
Oseen repeats his nomination for the photoeffect.
The Committee asks Gullstrand for an additional report on relativity and
Oseen for a report on the photoeffect.
Gullstrand sticks to his guns. His paper of the previous year [Gl] having been
criticized by Erich Kretschmann, Privatdozent in Konigsberg [K2], Gullstrand
published a rebuttal, a reprint of which he appended to his new statement [G2].
Oseen, the theoretical physicist, gives an excellent analysis of Einstein's paper
of 1905 on the light-quantum as well as of his work in 1909 on energy fluctuations
in blackbody radiation.
The Committee proposes Einstein for the 1921 prize. The Academy votes
accordingly.
That is how Einstein got the Nobel prize 'for his services to theoretical physics
and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.' That is also
why Aurivillius wrote Einstein on November 10, 1922, that his award was not
based on relativity.
In his presentation speech on December 10, 1922, Arrhenius said, 'Most dis-
cussion [of Einstein's oeuvre] centers on his theory of relativity. This pertains to
epistemology and has therefore been the subject of lively debate in philosophical
circles. It will be no secret that the famous philosopher Bergson in Paris has chal-
lenged this theory, while other philosophers have acclaimed it wholeheartedly.'
Bergson's collected works appeared in 1970 [B3]. The editors did not include
his book Duree et Simultaneite: A Propos de lo Theorie d'Einstein. Einstein came
to know, like, and respect Bergson. Of Bergson's philosophy he used to say, 'Gott
verzeih ihm,' God forgive him.
'Gullstrand had never published on relativity before that time. It is not more than my guess that he
might have become intrigued with general relativity because of one feature that he had contributed
to in a quite different context: the bending of light.
HOW EINSTEIN GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE 511
A further exchange between Gullstrand and Kretschmann settled their differ-
ences to mutual satisfaction [K3].
Why did Einstein not get the Nobel prize for relativity? Largely, I believe,
because the Academy was under so much pressure to award him. The many letters
sent in his behalf were never the result of any campaign. Leading physicists had
recognized him for what he was. It is understandable that the Academy was in no
hurry to award relativity before experimental issues were clarified, first in special
relativity, later in general relativity. It was the Academy's bad fortune not to have
anyone among its members who could competently evaluate the content of relativ-
ity theory in those early years. Oseen's proposal to give the award for the pho-
toeffect must have come as a relief of conflicting pressures.
Was the photoeffect worth a Nobel prize? Without a doubt. Einstein's paper
on that subject was the first application of quantum theory to systems other than
pure radiation. That paper showed true genius. The order of awards for quantum
physics was perfect: first Planck, then Einstein, then Bohr. It is a touching twist
of history that the Committee, conservative by inclination, would honor Einstein
for the most revolutionary contribution he ever made to physics.

Einstein's Proposals
for the Nobel Prize
Einstein's Nobel prize proposals enable us to catch glimpses of what, in his judg-
ment, were and were not important issues in his time. In what follows, the reader
will find neither a dissertation on the virtues, follies, and harm of prizes and
awards, nor a gossip column about personalities.
Nine of the following entries refer to physics proposals. Unless noted otherwise,
they are all addressed to the Nobel Committee in Stockholm in the form of letters.
There are also seven proposals for the peace prize directed to the Storting in Oslo.
One entry deals with correspondence about a Nobel prize in medicine for Sigmund
Freud, another concerns a literature prize for Hermann Broch.
7. Fall 1918. In September 1918 Einstein received a request from Stockholm
for a nomination in physics for the year 1919. In his response,* he proposes
Planck for his achievements on the subject of heat radiation and especially for the
two papers "On the law of the energy distribution in the normal spectrum" and
"On the elementary quanta of matter and electricity." 'Because of this work, the
author has not only given a first exact determination of the absolute size of atoms
but especially [he has] also laid the foundations for the quantum theory, the fer-
tility of which for all of physics has become manifest in recent years.'** Einstein
stresses that Bohr's theory of spectra is also based on Planck's work.
On November 13, 1919, Planck is awarded the physics prize for 1918.
2. January 19, 1921. Einstein endorses the proposal of the Czech parliament
to give the peace prize to Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, the first president (from 1918
to 1935) of the young nation of Czechoslovakia. In his letter, Einstein lauds
Masaryk for his role in protecting oppressed minorities, especially the Czechs and
the Jews, and adds, 'I am convinced that awarding him the Nobel prize would
represent a beautiful victory for international reconciliation.. . .'f
3. October 26, 1923. In response to another request for a nomination in phys-
ics, Einstein writes that he finds it difficult to make one definite proposal. 'In order
'Undated but no doubt written in the fall of 1918.

to ease my conscience,' he notes the following 'approximately equivalent
possibilities:
[J.] Franck and [G.] Hertz, for their investigations of light excitation by colli-
sions with electrons
[P.] Langevin and [P.] Weiss, for the statistical theory of magnetism
[O.] Stern and [W.] Gerlach, for the experimental proof of orientation of atoms
in a magnetic field required by the quantum theory
[A.] Sommerfeld, for his contributions to quantum mechanics
A. H. Compton, for the discovery of the quantum scattering of Roentgen
radiation
C. T. R. Wilson, for the Nebelmethode as [a method of] proof of the ionization
generated by corpuscular rays
P. Debye, for his contributions to our knowledge of molecular forces.'
In 1925 the physics prize is awarded to Franck and Hertz.
4. May 22, 1925. Einstein proposes the famous Brazilian explorer Marshal
Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon for the peace prize. 'I take the liberty to draw
your attention to the activities of General Rondon from Rio de Janeiro, since,
during my visit to Brazil, I have gained the impression that this man is highly
worthy of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. His work consists of adjusting Indian
tribes to the civilized world without the use of weapons or coercion.'
5. September 28, 1927. In a brief note, Einstein again proposes Compton 'for
the discovery of the Compton effect, named after him, which is a milestone in our
knowledge about the nature of radiation.'
In 1927 the physics prize is awarded to Compton and Wilson. Compton's cita-
tion reads, 'For his discovery of the effect named after him.'
6. February 15, 1928. Dr Heinrich Meng from Stuttgart, editor of Zeit-
schrift fur Psychoanalytische Pddagogik, and author Stefan Zweig (then in Salz-
burg) have written to a number of prominent figures urging them to support the
nomination of Freud for the Nobel prize. On February 15, 1928, Einstein replies
to Meng, 'With all [my] admiration for the genius of Freud's achievement, I can-
not decide to intervene in the present case. About the extent of truth [Wahrheits-
gehalt] of Freud's teachings, I cannot come to a conviction for myself, much less
[can I] make a judgment that would also be authoritative to others. I would further
suggest to you that it is questionable whether the achievement of a psychologist
like Freud falls within the domain of the Nobel prize for medicine, which is pre-
sumably the only one that should be considered.'
Upon receiving a reply from Meng, Einstein reiterates the same views in a
letter of October 26, 1928, adding that 'the unique difficulty of the material def-
initely requires that this judgment be left to experienced professionals.'
Far more fascinating than this award issue are the relations between two men
who each in his own way transformed his own and later times. Their jointly
authored booklet Why War? gives only minor indications of the personal senti-
ments of one in regard to the other [El]. Much more revealing information is
EINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 515
found in the excellent Freud biography by Ernest Jones [Jl]. I mention here one
additional comment by Einstein on Freud, contained in a letter written in 1949:
'The old one had ... a sharp vision; no illusion lulled him asleep except for an
often exaggerated faith in his own ideas'* [E2]. I leave, of course, to myself and
to my readers all attempts to analyse what this statement reveals about Freud and
about Einstein.
7. September 25, 1928. This is the first of three letters in which Einstein
focuses attention on the founding of quantum mechanics. 'In my opinion, the most
important and not yet rewarded achievement in physics is the insight into the wave
nature of mechanical processes.' He makes several suggestions. First, that one half
of an award should go to de Broglie, the other half to be shared by 'Davison [sic]
und ein Mitarbeiter' (C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer). He finds it 'a difficult
case since de Broglie is the decisive initiator without having exhausted the issue
[because he] has not thought of the possibility of an experimental proof of the
existence of matter waves. (This is not quite correct. De Boglie did mention the
possibility of matter diffraction in his PhD thesis.) Einstein continues: 'Equiva-
lently, the theoreticians Heisenberg and Schroedinger (one shared Nobel prize)
should be considered (for 1930?). With respect to achievement, each one of these
investigators deserves a full Nobel prize although their theories in the main coin-
cide in regard to reality content. However, in my opinion, de Broglie should take
precedence, especially because [his] idea is certainly correct, while it still seems
problematic how much will ultimately survive of the grandiosely conceived theo-
ries of the two last-named investigators.'
As further alternatives, Einstein mentions one prize to be shared by de Broglie
and Schroedinger, another by Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan. He does not con-
sider this quite ideal since Heisenberg is relatively the strongest case of the three.
Nor does he feel comfortable giving the award for quantum mechanics to theo-
reticians only.
The Dirac equation was published early in 1928. It is significant that neither
in 1928 nor at any subsequent time does Einstein ever propose Dirac.
In 1929 the physics prize is awarded to de Broglie 'for his discovery of the wave
nature of the electron.' In 1937,' Davisson shares the prize with G. P. Thomson
'for their experimental discoveries of the diffraction of electrons by crystals.'
8. September 20, 1931. Einstein is now convinced that quantum mechanics
will survive.** He proposes 'the founders of the wave, or quantum, mechanics,
Professor E. Schroedinger from Berlin and Professor W. Heisenberg from
Leipzig. In my opinion, this theory contains without doubt a piece of the ultimate
truth. The achievements of both men are independent of each other and so signif-
icant that it would not be appropriate to divide a Nobel prize between them.
* Der Alte hat aber scharf gesehen; er hat sich durch keine Illusion einlullen lassen ausser manchmal
durch ein iibertriebenes Vertrauen in die eigenen Einfalle.
**See Section 25a.
516 APPENDICES
'The question of who should get the prize first is hard to answer. Personally,
I assess Schroedinger's achievement as the greater one, since I have the impression
that the concepts created by him will carry further than those of Heisenberg.
[Here Einstein adds a footnote: This, however, is only my own opinion, which
may be wrong.] On the other hand, the first important publication by Heisenberg
precedes the one by Schroedinger. If I had to decide, I would give the prize first
to Schroedinger.'
Einstein's judgment of the relative scientific merits of Schroedinger's and Hei-
senberg's work was indeed wrong. This may not have helped the deliberations in
Stockholm. No physics prize is awarded in 1931.
9. January 1932. Einstein writes in support of the peace prize for the
Englishman Herbert Runham Brown.* (At about the same time, a similar pro-
posal is also made by twenty-five members of the British parliament.) Of Brown,
honorary secretary of War Resisters' International, Einstein writes, 'Mr Runham
Brown is, in my opinion, the most meritorious active fighter in the service of
pacificism, who has indefatigably served this important cause with great
courage....'
10. September 29, 1932. 'Again this year I propose Professor E. Schroedinger
from Berlin. I am of the opinion that our understanding of the quantum phenom-
ena has been furthered most by his work in connection with the work of de Brog-
lie.' The distinction between Schroedinger and Heisenberg is still present.
The Nobel committee for physics decides to drop the 1931 prize altogether and
to postpone the 1932 award until 1933. In 1933 they award the 1932 prize to
Heisenberg and the 1933 prize jointly to Schroedinger and Dirac.
77. October 27, 1935. Einstein has written twice before in support of others'
peace prize proposals. This time he makes his own suggestion. 'Formally speak-
ing, I have no right to propose a candidate for the Nobel peace prize,' but, he
adds, his conscience demands that he write anyway. He then proposes Carl von
Ossietzky, 'a man who, by his actions and his suffering, is more deserving of it
than any other living person.' Such an award, Einstein continues, would be 'a
historic act that would suit to a high degree the solution of the peace problem.'**
Von Ossietzky was chief editor of Die Weltbilhne, a pacifist political weekly in
Berlin, when on March 12, 1929, an article appeared in its columns in which it
was revealed that much of the research and development for German civil aviation
was secretly directed toward military purposes. Both the author of the article and
von Ossietzky were accused of treason and sentenced to eighteen months in jail.
He received amnesty in December 1932. In February 1933, very soon after the
Nazis came to power, he was sent to a concentration camp. Efforts to nominate
*For the circumstances surrounding this action, see [N2]
**See [N3] for an account of the delicate problems arising from this proposal by Einstein and by
others. See [Gl] for a detailed biography of Ossietzky.
EINSTEIN S PROPOSALS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 517
him for the peace prize, initiated in 1934, grew into an international campaign.
In January 1936, more than 500 members of the parliaments of Czechoslovakia,
England, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland signed petitions
nominating him for the peace prize. He stayed in the concentration camp until
May 1936, when he was moved to a prison hospital with a severe case of tuber-
culosis. In the fall of 1936, Goering offered him freedom in exchange for a dec-
laration that he would refuse the peace prize if it were awarded to him. Von
Ossietzky refused. In November 1936 he was awarded the peace prize for 1935.
On January 30, 1937, Hitler decreed that no German was henceforth permitted
to receive Nobel prizes of any kind. The Nobel committee nevertheless awarded
to Germans the chemistry prize in 1938 and the medicine prize in 1939. Both
awards were declined. Von Ossietzky stayed in a prison hospital until, in May
1938, he died of tuberculosis.
12. January 17, 1940. Einstein writes to Mrs de Haas-Lorentz: 'Together
with some local colleagues, I have proposed Otto Stern and [I. I.] Rabi for the
invention of new methods for the measurement of molecular magnetic moments.'
In 1944 the prize for 1943 is awarded to Stern, the one for 1944 to Rabi.
13. January 1945. Einstein sends the following telegram: 'Nominate Wolf-
gang Pauli for physics prize stop his contributions to modern quantum theory
consisting in so-called Pauli or exclusion principle became fundamental part of
modern quantum physics being independent from the other basic axioms of that
theory stop Albert Einstein.'
In 1945 Pauli receives the physics prize 'for the discovery of the exclusion prin-
ciple, also called the Pauli principle.'
14. November 18, 1947. Einstein writes to Guy von Dardel, 'I would find it
quite justified that Raoul Wallenberg should receive the Nobel prize [for peace]
and I am gladly permitting you to mention this expression of my opinion to any
person.'* On December 10, 1947, three members of the Swedish Riksdag formally
propose Wallenberg to the Storting.
In 1944 Wallenberg, born in 1912 in Stockholm, was appointed third secretary
to the Swedish legation in Budapest, with the task of organizing a large-scale
action of relief from Nazi terror. He and his staff managed to bring about 20 000
people under the direct protection of the Swedish legation. His name soon became
legendary. Several times the Nazis unsuccessfully tried to entrap and kill him.
Early in 1945 Wallenberg fell into the hands of the Soviet army, which was occu-
pying Budapest. He vanished. It is certain that at the turn of 1946-7 he was in
cell No. 151 of the Lubianka prison in Moscow. It is believed by some that he
may still be alive today. In 1947 Einstein wrote to Stalin, 'As an old Jew, I appeal
to you to find and send back to his country Raoul Wallenberg . . .[who], risking
*I learned much about this case from Wallenberg's half-brother, my friend Guy von Dardel, and
from a paper on Wallenberg by G. B. Freed, from which I have quoted liberally [Fl].
518 APPENDICES
his own life, worked to rescue thousands of my unhappy Jewish people' [E3]. In
reply, an underling stated that he had been authorized by Stalin to say that a
search for Wallenberg had been unsuccessful [Tl].
15. March 5, 1951. Einstein writes to Dr Alvin Johnson, president emeritus
of The New School for Social Research in New York City. The letter appears to
be in response to an earlier letter by Johnson concerning the possibility of a Nobel
prize for literature for Hermann Broch. Einstein writes that he has no insight and
understanding concerning modern literature. However, from having read parts of
Broch's oeuvre, 'I believe that it would probably be quite justified' to propose
Broch.
(Broch was born in Vienna in 1886. He emigrated to the United States in 1938.
He and Einstein became friends soon thereafter. Einstein had read his main book,
The Death of Virgil, and admired it [Bl]. Broch died in New Haven in 1951.)
16. Sometime in 1951. Einstein proposes Friedrich Wilhelm Forster for the
peace prize: 'It might be difficult to find people who have actually been successful
in their efforts to secure peace.' Nevertheless, he adds, Forster belongs to the group
of leading personalities who have worked solidly with great dedication for this
cause, especially by exposing the dangers of 'Prussian-German militarism' by his
writings, first in Germany, then in Switzerland, and finally in the United States.
Forster, a major figure in pedagogy, was a lifelong opponent of German mili-
tarism, which he attacked in numerous books, thereby incurring the hostility of
Germany's ruling groups from the Second and Third Reichs. In 1895 he was
imprisoned for three months on charges of libel against the Kaiser and in 1926
was called a traitor when he published accounts of secret rearmament efforts in
Germany. He came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen. He died
in 1966 in a sanitarium near Zurich. For more on Forster, see [F2] and [N4].
77. January 12, 1954. Einstein writes in support of a proposal by von Laue
to award the physics prize to Bothe. In his letter, Einstein refers to the Bothe -
Geiger experiment as Bothe's principal contribution.
In 1954 Bothe and Born share the physics prize.
18. March 3, 1954. By telegram, Einstein sends his last proposal: 'I have the
honor of recommending for your consideration for the forthcoming award of the
Nobel peace prize the international organization known as Youth Alijah, through
which children from 72 countries have been rescued and rehabilitated in Israel.'
The peace prize for 1954 is awarded to the office of the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees.
It has recently come to my notice that on 19 December 1925 Einstein wrote to
Stockholm proposing A. H. Compton.
