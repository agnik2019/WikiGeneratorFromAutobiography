 Chapter 7  OPRAH’S YELLOW BRICK ROAD  Years ago — at the end of ﬁ  lming  The Color Purple  — Quincy Jones told Oprah, “Your future is so bright that it’s going to burn your eyes.” For a long time, Oprah would repeat the statement, but it is now so obviously true, neither she nor others have to say it. The future has arrived with all its promise intact. One can tick off the work Oprah has done since those early days: Several decades in radio and television, from her be-ginnings in Tennessee as a young student, going on to Baltimore tele-vision in her 20s, and then on to stardom in Chicago with a television show that continued to draw millions of viewers until Oprah decided it was time to move on. Her new venture, the purchase of the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), in partnership with what formerly was Dis-covery Channel, suggests it is all Oprah, all the time.  For many people, this has been a fortunate time in which to be living, surely more than the years when Oprah started out. She was illegitimate, born into poverty, in a small town, in a poor rural Southern state; parts of the United States still had its own style of apartheid life, and civil rights was yet to become a reality. How, in growing up, could she have envi-sioned even a small part of what lay ahead? Schools were segregated, and most women had returned to their homes to raise families after World 192 OPRAH WINFREYWar II, while men went back to their jobs, went to universities, and re-claimed their roles as heads of family. Television was in its infancy. Blacks were called Negroes—not a demeaning word then, but it soon carried heavy freight—and few people of color could enter the white world of professions. Little more than a career in entertainment provided a door as an opening, but even then there were barriers and limitations. With all things stacked against her, Oprah found the way out of poverty and all its heavy baggage to stardom. On one of her many visits to Africa, she proclaimed her thanks to God for what she had lived to “see . . . touch, hear, and feel.”  Despite the difﬁ  culties she faced, it is certain that Oprah’s tempera-ment and will would have made her a leader at any time, because, from her earliest days, she has believed in taking charge of herself and her own life. But as she followed her chosen “yellow brick road,” she decided it was also necessary to help others along the way. For years she has blithely moved on as if there has never been any doubt about her direc-tion. When writing about the good fortune of U.S. women in contrast to the millions, even billions, of women around the world, she has stressed their right to follow the path of choice and admonished them to “use it.” Referring to a line from a favorite poet, Emily Dickinson, she speaks of her own way now and in the future; it is to “dwell in possibility.”  Believing in possibility has brought her joy and conﬁ  dence. Her op-timism is reminiscent of the words of entertainer Al Jolson—a white, Jewish singer and actor in the early part of the 20th century—who also climbed from poverty and hardship. Jolson’s signature role generally was that of a black man who would tell his audience, “You ain’t seen noth-ing yet.” (The lines became a popular song in the 1970s.)  In middle age, a grateful, happy Oprah is suggesting just that. She has embarked on still another adventure. Although she isn’t blinded any more today than at other periods of her life from the reality of problems that often appear insurmountable, she tells viewers of her shows, read-ers of her magazines, and her many audiences in the United States and around the world that she constantly attempts to ﬁ  nd some way to deal with problems. For her there has always been a path through religion and spirituality, a part through determination, and a part that appears to be almost infallible judgment. Even though she has been harshly at-tacked in pulpits, books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs by numerous  OPRAH’S YELLOW BRICK ROAD 193members of traditional religions, she has always moved on. She has been satirized frequently in friendly skits and cruelly in cartoons and also un-dermined by some who have beneﬁ  ted from her largesse. Nevertheless, like Dorothy of  The Wizard of Oz,  who danced along the yellow brick road in her red jeweled shoes, Oprah keeps moving on and has left the old shoes behind. On December 30, 2010, Mary Altaffer of the Associ-ated Press suggested that Oprah probably regards her move to cable television “as one more [step] on the yellow brick road of blessings.”  Not everyone agrees with or approves of her decisions. But as a lover of gospel music, Oprah has a favorite song that seems to sum up her life-time view: “Stand.”  What do you do when you’ve done all you can, and it seems like it’s never enough?  What do you give when you’ve given your all, and it seems you can’t make it through?  (Refrain) You just stand.  With the song serving metaphorically for the determination needed to overcome all kinds of adversity, like the Ancient Mariner of Cole-ridge’s poem, she repeats her message again and again. There are those who feel she preaches rather than entertains, but if the criticism hurts, she ignores it and continues with what she considers her mission. She builds schools and supports those that need money to move ahead and even to survive. She gives scholarships to the worthy and needy. She can be counted on when dire emergencies arise, such as the 9/11 events, or Hurricane Katrina, or the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Through all her venues, she brings to the attention of the country—perhaps not always altruistically—the hidden horrors of the human conditions in the United States and elsewhere. And much like the Ancient Mariner—who tells his tale when it is necessary, passing “from land to land” with a “strange power of speech,” knowing that when he encounters certain people he must teach them with his tale — Oprah often seems to sense such needs.  From her teenage years on, she has found the strength to overcome whatever obstacles are in her path, each time ﬁ  nding the “one true thing” she knows and exhorting everyone to do the same. Several years 194 OPRAH WINFREYago, in attempting to explain her passion and dedication to making a difference, she wrote in a column the words of a song sent to her from Maya Angelou: “When you have the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance.” And even though she didn’t set out to create what has turned into more than what she labels “this big life,” she intends to meet all its challenges. In one forum or another—in speeches, writings, and programs—Oprah expresses her belief that it is the journey that mat-ters. Despite the fact that her big life has provided almost everything anyone could want, her optimism suggests that the best is yet to come. The spiritual side of her nature informs her belief that she has a mis-sion, a responsibility to the world, and even the planet, to use her life to do good. It is little wonder that entertainer Zach Braff was led to say in 2007, “In television, there’s  Oprah,  and then there’s everyone else.”   BIBLIOGRAPHY  Achebe, Chinua.  Things Fall Apart.
