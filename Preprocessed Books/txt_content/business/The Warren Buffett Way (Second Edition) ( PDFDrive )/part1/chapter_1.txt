11The World’sGreatest InvestorEvery year, Forbes magazine publishes a list of the 400 richest Amer-icans, the elite Forbes 400. Individuals on the list come and gofrom year to year, as their personal circumstances change and theirindustries rise and fall, but some names are constant. Among those lead-ing the list year in and year out are certain megabillionaires who tracetheir wealth to a product (comp uter software or hardware), a service(retailing), or lucky parentage (inheritance). Of those perennially in thetop five, only one made his fortune through investment savvy. Thatone person is Warren Buffett.In the early 1990s, he was number one. Then for a few years, he see-sawed between number one and number two with a youngster namedBill Gates. Even for the dot-com-crazed year 2000, when so much ofthe wealth represented by the Forbes 400 came from the phenomenalgrowth in technology, Buffett, who smilingly eschews high-tech any-thing, was firmly in fourth position. He was still the only person in thetop five for whom the “source of wealth” column read “stock market.”In 2004, he was solidly back in the number two position.In 1956, Buffett started his investment partnership with $100; afterthirteen years, he cashed out with $25 million. At the time of this writ-ing (mid-2004), his personal net worth has increased to $42.9 billion,the stock in his company is selling at $92,900 a share, and millions ofinvestors around the world hang on his every word.2 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYTo fully appreciate Warren Buffett, however, we have to go be yondthe dollars, the performance accolades, and the reputation.INVESTMENT BEGINNINGSWarren Edward Buffett was born August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska.His grandfather owned a grocery store (and once employed a youngCharlie Munger); his father was a local stockbroker. As a boy, WarrenBuffett was always fascinated with numbers and could easily do complexmathematical calculations in his head. At age eight, he began reading hisfather’s books on the stock market; at age eleven, he marked the board atthe brokerage house where his father worked. His early years were en-livened with entrepreneurial ventures, and he was so successful that hetold his father he wanted to skip college and go directly into business. Hewas overruled.Buffett attended the business school at the University of Nebraska,and while there, he read a new book on investing by a Columbia profes-sor named Benjamin Graham. It was, of course, The Intelligent Investor.Buffett was so taken with Graham’s ideas that he applied to ColumbiaBusiness School so that he could study directly with Graham. Bill Ruane,now chairman of the Sequoia Fund, was in the same class. He recalls thatthere was an instantaneous mental chemistry between Graham and Buf-fett, and that the rest of the class was primarily an audience.1Not long after Buffett graduated from Columbia with a master’s de-gree in economics, Graham invited his former student to join his com-pany, the Graham-Newman Corporation. During his two-year tenurethere, Buffett became fully immersed in his mentor’s investment approach(see Chapter 2 for a full discussion of Graham’s philosophy).In 1956, Graham-Newman disbanded. Graham, then 61, decided toretire, and Buffett returned to Omaha. Armed with the knowledge hehad acquired from Graham, the financial backing of family and friends,and $100 of his own money, Buffett began a limited investment part-nership. He was twenty-five years old.THE BUFFETT PARTNERSHIP , LTD.The partnership began with seven limited partners who together con-tributed $105,000. The limited partners received 6 percent annually onThe World’s Greatest Investor 3their investment and 75 percent of the profits above this bogey; the re-maining 25 percent went to Buffett, who as general partner had essen-tially free rein to invest the partnership’s funds.Over the next thirteen years, Buffett compounded money at an an-nual rate of 29.5 percent.2It was no easy task. Although the Dow JonesIndustrial Average declined in price five different years during thatthirteen-year period, Buffett’s partnership never had a down year. Buf-fett, in fact, had begun the partnership with the ambitious goal of out-performing the Dow by ten points every year. And he did it—not byten—but by twenty-two points!As Buffett’s reputation grew, more people asked him to managetheir money. For the partnership, Buffett bought controlling interestsin several public and private companies, and in 1962 he began buyingshares in an ailing textile company called Berkshire Hathaway.That same year, 1962, Buffett moved the partnership office fromhis home to Kiewit Plaza in Omaha, where his office remains today.The next year, he made a stunning purchase.Tainted by a scandal involving one of its clients, American Expresssaw its shares drop from $65 to $35 almost overnight. Buffett hadlearned Ben Graham’s lesson well: When stocks of a strong company areselling below their intrinsic value, act decisively. Buffett made the bolddecision to put 40 percent of the partnership’s total assets, $13 million,into American Express stock. Over the next two years, the shares tripledin price, and the partners netted a cool $20 million in profit. It was pureGraham—and pure Buffett.By 1965, the partnership’s assets had grown to $26 million. Fouryears later, explaining that he found the market highly speculative andworthwhile values increasingly scarce, Buffett decided to end the invest-ment partnership.When the partnership disbanded, investors received their propor-tional interests. Some of them, at Buffett’s recommendation, sought outmoney manager Bill Ruane, his old classmate at Columbia. Ruaneagreed to manage their money, and thus was born the Sequoia Fund.Others, including Buffett, invested their partnership revenues in Berk-shire Hathaway. By that point, Buffett’s share of the partnership hadgrown to $25 million, which was enough to give him control of Berk-shire Hathaway.What he did with it is well known in the investment world. Eventhose with only a passing interest in the stock market recognize Buf fett’s4 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYname and know something of his st unning success. In the followingchapters, we trace the upward trajectory of Berkshire Hathaway in theforty years that Buffett has been in control. Perhaps more important,we also look beneath the surface to uncover the commonsense philoso-phy on which he founded his success.THE MAN AND HIS COMPANYWarren Buffett is not easy to describe. Physically, he is unremarkable,with looks often described as grandfatherly. Intellectually, he is con-sidered a genius; yet his down-to-earth relationship with people istruly uncomplicated. He is simple, straightforward, forthright, andhonest. He displays an engaging combination of sophisticated dry witand cornball humor. He has a profound reverence for all things logicaland a foul distaste for imbecility. He embraces the simple and avoidsthe complicated.When reading Berkshire’s annual reports, one is struck by how com-fortable Buffett is quoting the Bible, John Maynard Keynes, or MaeW est. The operable word here is reading. Each report is sixty to seventypages of dense information: no pictures, no color graphics, no charts.Those who are disciplined enough to start on page one and continue un-interrupted are rewarded with a healthy dose of financial acumen, folksyhumor, and unabashed honesty. Buffett is candid in his reporting. Heemphasizes both the pluses and the minuses of Berkshire’s businesses. Hebelieves that people who own stock in Berkshire Hathaway are ownersof the company, and he tells them as much as he would like to be told ifhe were in their shoes.When Buffett took control of Berkshire, the corporate net worth was$22 million. Forty years later, it has grown to $69 billion. It has longbeen Buffett’s goal to increase the book value of Berkshire Hathaway ata 15 percent annual rate—well above the return achieved by the averageAmerican company. Since he took control of Berkshire in 1964, the gainhas been much greater: Book value per share has grown from $19 to$50,498, a rate of 22.2 percent compounded annually. This relative per-formance is all the more impressive when you consider that Berkshire ispenalized by both income and capital gains taxes and the Standard &Poor’s 500 returns are pretax.5Table 1.1 Berkshire’s Corporate Performance versus the S&P 500Annual Percentage ChangeIn Per-Share In S&P 500Book Value of with Dividends RelativeBerkshire Included ResultsYear (1) (2) (1)–(2)1965 23.8 10.0 13.81966 20.3 (11.7) 32.01967 11.0 30.9 (19.9)1968 19.0 11.0 8.01969 16.2 (8.4) 24.61970 12.0 3.9 8.11971 16.4 14.6 1.81972 21.7 18.9 2.81973 4.7 (14.8) 19.51974 5.5 (26.4) 31.91975 21.9 37.2 (15.3)1976 59.3 23.6 35.71977 31.9 (7.4) 39.31978 24.0 6.4 17.61979 35.7 18.2 17.51980 19.3 32.3 (13.0)1981 31.4 (5.0) 36.4Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2003 Annual Report.Notes: Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 monthsended 12/31.Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they holdat market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previusly the requirement. In this table, Berk-shire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the re-sults are calculated using the numbers originally reported.The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such asBerkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would havelagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P inyears when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggre-gate lag to be substantial.(continued)6Table 1.1 ContinuedAnnual Percentage ChangeIn Per-Share In S&P 500Book Value of with Dividends RelativeBerkshire Included ResultsYear (1) (2) (1)–(2)1982 40.0 21.4 18.61983 32.3 22.4 9.91984 13.6 6.1 7.51985 48.2 31.6 16.61986 26.1 18.6 7.51987 19.5 5.1 14.41988 20.1 16.6 3.51989 44.4 31.7 12.71990 7.4 (3.1) 10.51991 39.6 30.5 9.11992 20.3 7.6 12.71993 14.3 10.1 4.21994 13.9 1.3 12.61995 43.1 37.6 5.51996 31.8 23.0 8.81997 34.1 33.4 .71998 48.3 28.6 19.71999 .5 21.0 (20.5)2000 6.5 (9.1) 15.62001 (6.2) (11.9) 5.72002 10.0 (22.1) 32.12003 21.0 28.7 (7.7)Average Annual Gain—1965–2003 22.2 10.4 11.8Overall Gain—1964–2003 259,485 4,743The World’s Greatest Investor 7On a year-by-year basis, Berkshire’s returns have at times beenvolatile; changes in the stock market and thus the underlying stocks thatBerkshire owns create wide swings in per share value (see Table 1.1).To appreciate the volatility, compare the results for 1998 with 1999.In 1998, Berkshire’s value increased more than 48 percent. Then, in1999, Berkshire’s increase dropped to a paltry 0.5 percent, yet the S&P500 increased 21 percent. Two factors were involved: Berkshire’s resultscan be traced to poor return on consumer nondurables (Coca-Cola andGillette), while the S&P increase was fu eled by the outstanding perfor-mance of technology stocks, which Berkshire does not own.Speaking with the candor for which he is famous, Buffett admittedin the 1999 annual report that “truly large superiorities over the [S&P]index are a thing of the past.”3He predicted, however, that over timeBerkshire’s performance would be “modestly” better than the S&P. Andfor the next three years, this turned out to be the case. Then in 2003,even though Berkshire had a terrific year—book value up 21 percent—the S&P did even better.BUFFETT TODAYOver the most recent years, starting in the late 1990s, Buffett has beenless active in the stock market than he was in the 1980s and early 1990s.Many people have noticed this lack of activity and have wonderedwhether it signaled that the market had hit its top. Others have theo-rized that the lack of new major purchases of common stocks simplymeans that the type of stocks Buffett likes to purchase are no longerselling at attractive prices.W e know it is Buffett’s preference to “buy certainties at a dis-count.” “Certainties” are defined by the predictability of a company’seconomics. The more predicable a company’s economics, the more cer-tainty we might have about its valuation. When we look down the listof stocks that Buffett owns as well as the wholly owned companies in-side Berkshire, we are struck by the high degree of predictability re-flected there. The “discount” part of the statement obviously refers tothe stock price.Knowing that Buffett likes to buy highly predictable economics atprices below the intrinsic value of the business, we can conclude that his8 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYbuyer’s strike reflects the lack of choices in this arena. I am pretty surethat if Coca-Cola, Gillette, or other similar businesses were today sellingat fifty cents on the dollar, Buffett would add more shares to Berkshire’sportfolio.W e also know Buffett’s discipline of operating only within his “cir-cle of competence.” Think of this circle of competence as the cumulativehistory of your experience. If someone had successfully operated a certainbusiness within a certain industry for a decade or more, we would saythat person had achieved a high level of competence for the task at hand.However, if someone else had only a few years’ experience operating anew business, we could reasonably question that person’s level of compe-tence. Perhaps in Buffett’s rational mind, the sum total of his businessexperience in studying and operating the businesses in Berkshire’s port-folio sets the bar of competence so high that it would be difficult toachieve a similar level of insight into a new industry.So perhaps Buffett faces a dilemma. Within his circle of compe-tence, the types of stocks he likes to purchase are not currently selling atdiscounted prices. At the same time, outside his circle of competence,faster-growing businesses are being born in new industries that have yetto achieve the high level of economic certainty Buffett requires. If thisanalysis is correct, it explains why there have been no new large buys ofcommon stocks in the past few years.W e would be foolish indeed to assume that because the menu ofstocks available for purchase has been reduced, Warren Buffett is leftwithout investment options. Certainly he has been active in the fixed-income market, including taking a significant position in high-yieldbonds in 2002. He is alert for the periodic arbitrage opportunity as well,but considering the amount of capital Buffett needs to deploy to makemeaningful returns, the arbitrage markets are perhaps not as fruitful asthey once were.But Berkshire Hathaway shar eholders should not feel they are beingdeprived of opportunities. Too often, shar eholders forget one of themost important owner-related business principles Buffett outlines eachyear in the annual report. The fourth principle states, “Our preferencewould be able to reach our goal [of maximizing Berkshire’s average an-nual rate of gain in intrinsic value] by directly owning a diversifiedgroup of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similarThe World’s Greatest Investor 9businesses attained primarily through the purchases of marketable com-mon stocks.”In Berkshire’s early years, owning common stocks made the mostsense economically. Now, as common stock prices have risen dramati-cally and the purchasing power of Berkshire’s retained earnings hasmushroomed, the strategy of buying whole businesses, which is Buffett’sstated preference, has come to the forefront.There is a personal factor as well. W e know that Buffett greatly en-joys his relationships with his operating managers and takes a great dealof pride in Berkshire’s collection of operating businesses. Conversely,the angst he has endured by being a shareholder of publi cly traded com-panies, with the issues of executive compensation and questionablecapital reinvestment strategies that accompany ownership, may makebeing a shareholder l ess appealing for Buffett today than it used to be.If the economics are not compelling, why would Buffett choose to en-dure the corporate governance fiascos associated with being a majorshareholder?The only activity Buffett involves himself in with Berkshire’s operat-ing businesses is setting executive compensation and allocating the prof-its. Inside Berkshire’s world, these decisions are highly rational. Outsidein the stock market, management decisions on executive compensationand capital reallocation do not always reflect rationality.What does this mean for individual investors? Because Buffett is notactively involved in the stock market, should they automatically pullback as well? Buffett’s alternative strategy is to buy businesses outright,an option that is out of reach for most investors. So how should theyproceed?There appear to be two obvious choices. One is to make an invest-ment in Berkshire Hathaway and so participate in the economics ofthese outstanding businesses. The second choice is to take the Buffettapproach to investing, expand your circle of competence by studyingintently the business models of the companies participating in the NewEconomy landscape, and march ahead.I believe that the fundamental principles that have so long guidedBuffett’s decisions are uncompromised, and they still carry opportuni-ties for careful investors to outperform the S&P 500. The purpose ofthis book is to present those principles in a way that thoughtful in-vestors can understand and use.
