18912The Unreasonable ManGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote, “ The reasonable man adapts himselfto the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt theworld to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unrea-sonable man.”1Shall we conclude that Buffett is “the unreasonable man”? To do so,we must presume that his investment approach represents progress in thefinancial world, an assumption I freely make. For when we look at therecent achievements of the “reasonable” men, we see at best unevenness,at worst disaster.The 1980s are likely to be remembered as the Future Shock decadeof financial management. Program trading, leveraged buyouts, junkbonds, derivative securities, and index futures frightened many in-vestors. The distinctions between money managers faded. The grind offundamental research was replaced by the whirl of computers. Blackboxes replaced management interviews and investigation. Automationreplaced intuition.The late 1990s were, if an ything, worse. That frenzied, overvaluedmarketplace phenomenon generally known as the dot-com boom wentdisastrously bust. Warren Buffett called it “The Great Bubble.” And weall know what happens to bubbles when they get too big—they burst,dripping sticky residue on everyone within range.Many investors have become disenchanted and estranged from thefinancial marketplace. The residue of the three-year bear market of2000 through 2002 left many with a particularly bitter taste in their190 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmouths. Even now, with so many money managers unable to add valueto client portfolios, it is easy to understand why passive investing hasgained popularity.Throughout the past few decades, investors have flirted with manydifferent investment approaches. Periodically, small capi talization, largecapitalization, growth, value, moment um, thematic, and sector rotationhave proven financially rewarding. At other times, these approaches havestranded their followers in periods of mediocrity. Buffett, the exception,has not suffered periods of mediocrity. His investment performance,widely documented, has been consistently superior. As investors andspeculators alike have been distracted by esoteric approaches to investing,Buffett has quietly amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune. Throughout,businesses have been his tools, common sense his philosophy.How did he do it?Given the documented success of Buffett’s performance coupledwith the simplicity of his methodology, the more appropriate questionis, why don’t other investors apply his approach? The answer may lie inhow people think about investing.When Buffett invests, he sees a business. Most investors see only astock price. They spend far too much time and effort watching, predict-ing, and anticipating price changes and far too little time understandingthe business they are part owner of. Elementary as this may be, it is theroot that distinguishes Buffett.While other professional investors are busy studying capital assetpricing models, beta, and modern portfolio theory, Buffett studiesincome statements, capital reinvestment requirements, and the cash-generating capabilities of his companies. His hands-on experience withStocks are simple. All you do is buy shares in a great businessfor less than the business is intrinsically worth, with manage-ment of the highest integrity and ability. Then you own thoseshares forever.2WARREN BUFFETT , 1990The Unreasonable Man 191a wide variety of businesses in many industries separates Buffett fromall other professional investors. “Can you really explain to a fish whatit’s like to walk on land?” Buffett asks. “One day on land is worth athousand years of talking about it and one day running a business hasexactly the same kind of value.”3According to Buffett, the investor and the businessperson shouldlook at the company in the same way, because they both want essentiallythe same thing. The businessperson wants to buy the entire companyand the investor wants to buy portions of the company. Theoretically,the businessperson and the investor, to earn a profit, should be looking atthe same variables.If adapting Buffett’s investment strategy required o nly changingperspective, then probably more investors would become pro ponents.However, applying Buffett’s approach requires changing not only per-spective but also how performance is evaluated and communicated. Thetraditional yardstick for measuring performance is price change: thedifference between what you originally paid for a stock and its marketprice today.In the long run, the market price of a stock should approximate thechange in value of the business. However, in the short run, prices canswoop widely above and below a company’s value for any number of il-logical reasons. The problem remains that most investors use theseshort-term price changes to gauge the success or failure of their invest-ment approach, even though the changes often have little to do withthe changing economic value of the business and much to do with an-ticipating the behavior of other investors.To make matters worse, clients require professional money to reportperformance in quarterly periods. Knowing that they must improveshort-term performance or risk losing clients, professional investors be-come obsessed with chasing stock prices.The market is there only as a reference point to see if anybodyis offering to do anything foolish.4WARREN BUFFETT , 1988192 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett believes it is foolish to use short-term prices to judge a com-pany’s success. Instead, he lets his companies report their value to himby their economic progress. Once a year, he checks several variables:• Return on beginning shar eholder’s equity• Change in operating margins, debt levels, and capital expendi-ture needs• The company’s cash-generating abilityIf these economic measurements are improving, he knows the shareprice, over the long term, should reflect this. What happens to the stockprice in the short run is inconsequential.INVESTING THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYThe major goal of this book is to help investors understand and employthe investment strategies that have made Buffett successful. It is myhope that, having learned from his past experiences, you will be able togo forward and apply his methods. Perhaps in the future you may seeexamples of “Buffett-like” purchases and will be in a position to profitfrom his teachings.For instance . . .• When the stock market forces the price of a good businessdownward, as it did to the Washington Post, or• When a specific risk temporarily punishes a business, as it didW ells Fargo, or• When investor indifference allows a superior business such asCoca-Cola to be priced at half of its intrinsic value. . . investors who know how to think and act like Buffett will berewarded.The Warren Buffett Way is deceptively simple. There are no com-puter programs to learn, no cumbersome investment banking manualsto decipher. There is nothing scientific about valuing a busin ess andthen paying a price that is below this busin ess value. “What we do is notbeyond anybody els e’s competence,” says Buffett. “It is just not neces-sary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.”5The Unreasonable Man 193The irony is that Buffett’s success lies partly in the failure of others.“It has been helpful to me,” he explains, “to have tens of thousands (stu-dents) turned out of business schools taught that it didn’t do any good tothink.”6I do not mean to imply that Buffett is average, far from it. Heis unquestionably brilliant. But the gap between Buffett and other pro-fessional investors is widened by their own willingness to play a loser’sgame that Buffett chooses not to play. Readers of this book have thesame choice.Whether you are financially able to purchase 10 percent of a com-pany or merely one hundred shares, the Warren Buffett Way can help youachieve profitable investment returns. But this approach will help onlythose investors who are willing to help themselves. To be successful, youmust be willing to do some thinking on your own. If you need constantaffirmation, particularly from the stock market, that your investment de-cisions are correct, you will diminish your benefits. But if you can thinkfor yourself, apply relatively simple methods, and have the courage ofyour convictions, you will greatly increase your chances for profit.Whenever people try something new, there is initial apprehension.Adopting a new and different investment strategy will naturally evokesome uneasiness. In the Warren Buffett Way, the first step is the mostchallenging. If you can master this first step, the rest of the way is easy.Step One: Turn off the Stock MarketRemember that the stock market is manic-depressive. Sometimes it iswildly excited about future prospects, and at other times it is unreason-ably depressed. Of course, this behavior creates opportunities, particu-larly when shares of outstanding businesses are available at irrationallylow prices. But just as you would not take direction from an advisor whoexhibited manic-depressive tendencies, neither should you allow themarket to dictate your actions.The stock market is not a preceptor; it exists merely to assist youwith the mechanics of buying or selling shares of stock. If you believethat the stock market is smarter than you are, give it your money by in-vesting in index funds. But if you have done your homework and un-derstand your business and are confident that you know more aboutyour business than the stock market does, turn off the market.Buffett does not have a stock quote machine in his office and heseems to get by just fine without it. If you plan on owning shares in an194 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYoutstanding business for a number of years, what happens in the marketon a day-to-day basis is inconsequential. Y ou doneed to check in regu-larly, to see if something has happened that presents you with a niftyopportunity, but you will find that your portfolio weathers nicely evenif you do not look constantly at the market.“After we buy a stock, we would not be disturbed if markets closedfor a year or two,” says Buffett. “W e don’t need a daily quote on our100 percent position in See’s or H.H. Brown to validate our well being.Why, then, should we need a quote on our 7 percent interest [today,more than 8 percent] in Coke?”7Buffett is telling us that he does not need the market’s prices to vali-date Berkshire’s common stock investments. The same holds true for in-dividual investors. Y ou know you have approached Buffett’s level whenyour attention turns to the stock market and the only question on yourmind is: “Has anybody done an ything foolish lately that will give me anopportunity to buy a good business at a great price?”Step Two: Don’t Worry about the EconomyJust as people spend fruitless hours worrying about the stock marketso, too, do they worry needlessly about the economy. If you findyourself discussing and debating whether the economy is poised forgrowth or tilting toward a recession, whether interest rates are mov-ing up or down, or whether there is inflation or disinflation, STOP!Give yourself a break.Often investors begin with an economic assumption and then goabout selecting stocks that fit neatly within this grand design. Buffettconsiders this thinking to be foolish. First, no one has economic predic-tive powers any more than they have stock market predictive powers.Second, if you s elect stocks that will benefit by a particular economic en-vironment, you inevitably invite turnover and speculation, as you contin-uously adjust your portfolio to benefit in the next economic scenario.Buffett prefers to buy a business that has the opportunity to profitin any economy. Macroeconomic forces may affect returns on the mar-gin, but overall, Buffett’s businesses are able to profit nicely despite va-garies in the economy. Time is more wisely spent locating and owninga business that can profit in alleconomic environments than by rentinga group of stocks that do well only if a guess about the economy hap-pens to be correct.The Unreasonable Man 195Step Three: Buy a Business, Not a StockLet’s pretend that you have to make a very important decision. Tomor-row you will have an opportunity to pick one business to invest in. Tomake it interesting, let’s also pretend that once you have made your deci-sion, you can’t change it and, furthermore, you have to hold the invest-ment for ten years. Ultimately, the wealth generated from this businessownership will support you in your retirement. Now, what are you goingto think about?Probably many questions will run through your mind, bringing agreat deal of confusion. But if Buffett were given the same test, hewould begin by methodically measuring the business against his basictenets, one by one:• Is the business simple and understandable, with a consistent oper-ating history and favorable long-term prospects?•Is it run by honest and competent managers, who allocate capitalrationally, communicate candidly with shar eholders, and resist theinstitutional imperative?• Are the company’s economics in good shape—with highprofit margins, owners’ earnings, and increased market value thatmatches retained earnings?•Finally, is it available at a discount to its intrinsic value? Take note:Only at this final step does Buffett look at the stock market price.Calculating the value of a business is not mathematically complex.However, problems arise when we wrongly estimate a company’s fu-ture cash flow. Buffett deals with this problem in two ways. First, heincreases his chances of correctly predicting future cash flows by stick-ing with businesses that are simple and stable in character. Second, heinsists on a margin of safety between the company’s purchase price andits determined value. This margin of safety helps create a cushion thatwill protect him—and you—from companies whose future cash flowsare changing.Step Four: Manage a Portfolio of BusinessesNow that you are a business owner as opposed to a renter of stocks, thecomposition of your portfolio will change. Because you are no longer196 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYmeasuring your success solely by price change or comparing annual pricechange to a common stock benchmark, you have the liberty to s elect thebest businesses available. There is no law that says you must include everymajor industry within your portfolio, nor do you have to include 30, 40,or 50 stocks in your portfolio to achieve adequate diversification.Buffett believes that wide diversification is required only when in-vestors do not understand what they are doing. If these “know-nothing”investors want to own common stocks, they should simply put theirmoney in an index fund. But for the “know-something” investors, con-ventional diversification into dozens of stocks makes little sense. Buffettasks you to consider: If the best business you own presents the least fi-nancial risk and has the most favorable long-term prospects, why wouldyou put money into your twentieth favorite business instead of addingmoney to the top choice?Now that you are managing a portfolio of businesses, many thingsbegin to change. First, you are less likely to sell your best businesses justbecause they are returning a profit. Second, you will pick new businessesfor purchase with much greater care. Y ou will resist the temptation topurchase a marginal company just because you have cash reserves. If thecompany does not pass your tenet screen, don’t purchase it. Be patientand wait for the right business. It is wrong to assume that if you’re notbuying and selling, you’re not making progress. In Buffett’s mind, it istoo difficult to make hundreds of smart decisions in a lifetime. He wouldrather position his portfolio so he only has to make a few smart decisions.The Essence of Warren BuffettThe driving force of Warren Buffett’s investment strategy is the rationalallocation of capital. Determining how to allocate a company’s earningsis the most important decision a manager will make. Rationality—dis-playing rational thinking when making that choice—is the quality Buf-fett most admires. Despite underlying vagaries, a line of reason permeatesthe financial markets. Buffett’s success is the result of locating that line ofreason and never deviating from its path.Buffett has had his share of failures and no doubt will have a fewmore in the years ahead. But investment success is not synonymous withinfallibility, but it comes about by doing more things right than wrong.The Warren Buffett Way is no different. Its success depends as much onThe Unreasonable Man 197eliminating those things you can get wrong, which are many and per-plexing (predicting markets, economies, and stock prices), as on gettingthings right, which are few and simple (valuing a business).When Buffett purchases stocks, he focuses on two simple variables:the price of the business and its value. The price of a business can befound by looking up its quote. Determining value requires some calcula-tion, but it is not beyond the comprehension of those willing to do somehomework.Because you no longer worry about the stock market, the economy,or predicting stock prices, you are now free to spend more time under-standing your businesses. Y ou can spend more productive time readingannual reports and business and industry articles that will improve yourknowledge as an owner. In fact, the more willing you are to investigateyour own business, the less dependent you will be on others who makea living advising people to take irrational action.Ultimately, the best investment ideas will come from doing yourown homework. However, you should not feel intimidated. The WarrenBuffett Way is not beyond the comprehension of most serious investors.Y ou do not have to become an MBA-level authority on business valua-tion to use it successfully. Still, if you are uncomfortable applying thesetenets yourself, nothing prevents you from asking your financial advisorthese same questions. In fact, the more you enter into a dialogue onprice and value, the more you will begin to understand and appreciatethe Warren Buffett Way.Investing is not that complicated. Y ou need to know account-ing, the language of business. Y ou should read The IntelligentInvestor. Y ou need the right mind-set, the right temperament.Y ou should be interested in the process and be in your circle ofcompetence. Read Ben Graham and Phil Fisher, read annualreports and trade reports, but don’t do equations with Greekletters in them.8WARREN BUFFETT , 1993198 THE WARREN BUFFETT WAYBuffett, over his lifetime, has tried different investment gambits. At ayoung age he even tried his hand at stock charting. He has studied withthe brightest financial mind of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham,and managed and owned a host of businesses with his partner, CharlieMunger. Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digitinterest rates, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes. Through all thedistractions, he found his niche, that point where all things make sense:where investment strategy cohabits with personality. “Our (investment)attitude,” said Buffett, “fits our personalities and the way we want to liveour lives.”6Buffett’s attitude easily reflects this harmony. He is always upbeatand supportive. He is genuinely excited about coming to work every day.“I have in life all I want right here,” he says. “I love every day. I mean, Itap dance in here and work with nothing but people I like.”7“There isno job in the world,” he says, “that is more fun than running Berkshireand I count myself lucky to be where I am.”8199AfterwordManaging Money theWarren Buffett WayIbegan my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of1984. It was a typical hot and humid day in Baltimore. Fourteen newlyminted investment brokers, including myself, walked into an open-windowed conference room to begin our training. Sitting down at ourdesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by BenjaminGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983Berkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )written by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ).The first day of class included introductions and wel comes from topmanagement, including some of the firm’s most successful brokers. Oneafter another, they proudly explained that Legg Mason’s investmentphilosophy was 100 percent value-based. Clutching The Intelligent In-vestor, each took a turn at reciting chapter and verse from this holytext. Buy stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), low price-to-book value, and high dividends, they said. Don’t pay attention to thestock market’s daily gyrations, they said; its siren song would almostcertainly pull you in the wrong direction. Seek to become a contrarian,they said. Buy stocks that are down in price and unpopular so you canlater sell them at higher prices when they again become popular.200 AFTERWORDThe message we received throughout the first day was both consis-tent and logical. W e spent the afternoon analyzing Value Line researchreports and learning to distinguish between stocks that were down inprice and appeared to be cheap and stocks that were up in price and ap-peared to be expensive. By the end of our first training session, we all be-lieved we were in possession of the Holy Grail of investing. As we packedup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the BerkshireHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow’s class.“Warren Buffett,” she cheerily reminded us, “was Benjamin Graham’smost famous student, you know.”Back in my hotel room that night, I was wrung out with exhaus-tion. My eyes were blurry and tired, and my head was swimming withbalance sheets, income statements, and accounting ratios. Quite hon-estly, the last thing I wanted to do was to spend another hour or so read-ing an annual report. I was sure if one more investing factoid reached myinner skull, it would certainly explode. Reluctantly and very tiredly, Ipicked up the B erkshire Hathaway report.It began with a salutation To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath-away Inc. Here Buffett outlined the company’s major business princi-ples: “Our long-term economic goal is to maximize the average annualrate of gain in intrinsic value on a per share basis,” he wrote. “Our pref-erence would be to reach this goal by directly owning a diversified groupof businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average re-turns on capital.” He promised, “W e will be candid in our reporting toyou, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising businessvalue. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would wantto know if our positions were reversed.”The next fourteen pages outlined Berkshire’s major business holdingsincluding Nebraska Furniture Mart, Buffalo Evening News, See’s CandyShops, and the Government Employees Insurance Company. And true tohis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to knowabout the economics of these businesses, and more. He listed the commonstocks held in Berkshire’s insurance portfolio, including Affiliated Publi-cations, General Foods, Ogilvy & Mather, R.J. Reynolds Industries, andthe Washington Post. I was immediately struck by how seamlesslyBuffett moved back and forth between describing the stocks in the port-folio and the business attributes of Berkshire’s major holdings. It was as ifthe analyses of stocks and of businesses were one and the same.Afterword 201Granted, I had spent the entire day in class analyzing stocks, whichI knew were partial ownership interests in businesses, but I had notmade this most important analytical connection. When I studied ValueLine reports I saw accounting numbers and financial ratios. When Iread the Berkshire Hathaway report I saw businesses, with products andcustomers. I saw economics and cash earnings. I saw competitors andcapital expenditures. Perhaps I should have seen all that when I analyzedthe Value Line reports, but for whatever reason, it did not resonate inthe same way. As I continued to read the Berkshire report, the entireworld of investing, which was still somewhat mysterious to me, beganto open. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealedthe inner nature of investing.The next morning, I was bursting with a newly discovered passionfor investing, and when the training class was completed, I quickly re-turned to Philadelphia with a single-minded purpose: I was going to in-vest my clients’ money in the same fashion as did Warren Buffett.I knew I needed to know more, so I started building a file ofbackground information. First I obtained all the back copies of B erk-shire Hathaway annual reports. Then I ordered the annual reports ofall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then Icollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett Icould find.When the file was as complete as I could get it, I dove in. My goalwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share thoseinsights with my clients.Over the ensuing years, I built a respectable investment business. Byfollowing Buffett’s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clientsmore investment success than failure. Most of my clients intellectuallybought into the approach of thinking about stocks as businesses and try-ing to buy the best businesses at a discount. The few clients who did notstick around left not because the Buffett approach was unsound, but be-cause being contrarian was too much of an emotional challenge. Anda few left simply because they did not have enough patience to see theprocess succeed. They were impatient for activity, and the constant itchto do something—anything—drove them off the track. Looking back,I don’t believe I dealt with anyone who ope nly disagreed with the logicof Buffett’s investment approach, yet there were several who could notget the psychology right.202 AFTERWORDAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,magazine articles, interviews—an ything having to do with WarrenBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. I was like akid following a ballplayer. He was my hero, and each day I tried toswing the bat like Warren.As the years passed, I had a growing and powerful urge to become afull-time portfolio manager. At the time, investment brokers were com-pensated on their purchases and sales; it was largely a commission-basedsystem. As a broker, I was getting the “buy” part of the equation right,but Buffett’s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the“sell” part of the equation more difficult. Today, most financial servicebusinesses allow investment brokers and financial advisors to managemoney for their clients for a fee instead of a commission—if they choose.Eventually I met several portfolio managers who were compensated forperformance regardless of whether they did a lot of buying or selling.This arrangement appeared to me to be the perfect environment inwhich to apply Buffett’s teachings.Initially, I gained some portfolio management experience at a localbank trust department in Philadelphia, and along the way obtained theobligatory Chartered Financial Analyst designation. Later, I joined asmall investment counseling firm where I managed client portfolios for afee. Our objective was to help our clients achieve a reasonable rate of re-turn within an acceptable level of risk. Most had already achieved theirfinancial goals, and now they wanted to preserve their we alth. Because ofthis, many of the portfolios in our firm were balanced between stocksand bonds.It was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett downon paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment ap-proach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, hadbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it cer-tainly couldn’t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became thebasis for The Warren Buffett Way.The decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principlesdescribed in The Warren Buffett Way came from two directions.First, our investment counseling firm needed an instrument to managethose accounts that were not large enough to warrant a separately man-aged portfolio. Second, I wanted to establish a discretionary perfor-mance record that was based on the teachings of the book. I wanted toAfterword 203demonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, iffollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns.The proof would be in the performance.The new fund was established on April 17, 1995. Armed with theknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,coupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of thoseyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieveabove-average results. Instead, what we got was two very mediocreyears of investment performance.What happened?As I analyzed the portfolio and the stock market during this pe-riod, I discovered two important but separate explanations. First, whenI started the fund, I populated the portfolio mostly with BerkshireHathaway-type stocks: newspapers, beverage companies, other con-sumer nondurable businesses, and selected financial service companies.I even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway.Because my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett’s teachings,perhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfoliowere stocks Buffett himself had purchased. But the difference betweenBuffett’s stocks in the 1980s and those same stocks in 1997 wasstriking. Many of the companies that had consistently grown ownerearnings at a double-digit rate in the 1980s were slowing to a high single-digit rate in the late 1990s. In addition, the stock prices of these com-panies had steadily risen over the decade and so the discount to intrinsicvalue was smaller compared with the earlier period. When the econom-ics of your business slow and the discount to intrinsic value narrows, thefuture opportunity for outsized investment returns diminishes.If the first factor was lack of high growth level inside the portfolio,the second factor was what happening outside the portfolio. At thesame time that the economics of the businesses in the fund wereslowing, the economics of certain technology companies—telecommu-nications, software, and Internet service providers—were sharply ac-celerating. Because these new industries were taking a larger share ofthe market capitalization of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the stockmarket itself was rising at a faster clip. What I soon discovered was thatthe economics of what I owned in the fund were no match for thenewer, more powerful technology-based companies then revving up inthe stock market.204 AFTERWORDIn 1997, my fund was at the crossroads. If I continued to invest inthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to gen-erate just average results. Even Buffett was telling Berkshire Hathawayshareholders they could no lon ger expect to earn the above-average in-vestment gains the company had achieved in the past. I knew if I contin-ued to own the same stocks Buffett owned in his portfolio at theseelevated pric es, coupled with moderating economics, I was unlikely togenerate above-average investment results for my shar eholders. And inthat case, what was the purpose? If a mutual fund cannot generate, overtime, investment results better than the broad market index, then itsshareholders would be bet ter off in an index mutual fund.Standing at the investment crossroads during this period was dra-matic. There were questions about whether the fund should continue.There were questions about whether Buffett could compete against thenewer industries and still provide above-average results. And there wasthe meta-question of whether the whole philosophy of thinking aboutstocks as businesses was a relevant approach when analyzing the newertechnology-oriented industries.I knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was stillvalid. I knew without question that this business-analytical approachwould still provide the opportunity for investors to spot mispricing andthus profit from the market’s narrower view. I knew all these thingsand more, yet I momentarily hesitated at the shoreline, unable to crossinto the new economic landscape.I was fortunate to become friends with Bill Miller when I firstbegan my career at Legg Mason. At the time, Bill was comanaging avalue fund with Ernie Kiehne. Bill periodically spent time with thenewer investment brokers sharing his thoughts about the stock market,about companies, and ideas from the countless books he had read. AfterI left Legg Mason to become a portfolio manager, Bill and I remainedfriends. After The Warren Buffett Way was published, we circled backfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navi-gating the economic landscape.In the book, I pointed out that Buffett did not rely solely on lowP/E ratios to s elect stocks. The driving force in value creation wasowner earnings and a company’s ability to generate above-average returns on capital. Sometimes a stock with a low P/E ratio did generatecash and achieve high returns on capital and subsequently became a greatinvestment. Other times, a stock with a low P/E ratio consumed cashAfterword 205and generated below-average returns on capital and so became a poorinvestment. Stocks with low P/E ratios might be a nice pond to fish infor ideas, Buffett said, but what makes them go up is the cash and highreturns on invested capital.Bill had figured this out a few years earlier, and he was alreadysteering his value fund in this direction. He had already chalked up fourconsecutive years of outperformance and was turning heads in the in-vestment community.With my fund struggling to gain a footing, I met with Bill to dis-cuss strategies and opportunities. I told him Buffett’s investment ap-proach was solid. He agreed. I told him the only way to outwit the stockmarket was to analyze stocks as businesses in order to discover the deep-rooted fundamental changes that occur in a businesses before the mar-ket’s pricing mechanism picks it up. He agreed. I told him I was certainBuffett’s approach could be applied to the new industries but I was un-sure how to proceed. He said, “Come work with us at Legg Mason andI’ll show you how it works.”Bill, using a valuation approach that focused not on P/E ratios buton cash earnings and return on capital, had already been pur suing thenewer companies in the technology space. He purchased Dell Computerin 1996 at six times earnings with a 40 percent return on capital. Othervalue managers also bought Dell but then they sold at twelve timesearnings because the conventional wisdom dictated you always boughtPC manufacturers at six times earnings and sold them at twelve timesearnings. Bill instead studied the business model and soon discoveredthat Dell’s return on capital was quickly rising to an astonishing triple-digit rate of return. So while other value managers sold their DellComputer at twelve times earnings, Bill held on at twenty times, thirtytimes, and forty times earnings, believing that the company was stilldeeply undervalued relative to its rapidly growing intrinsic value. Andhe was right. His investment in Dell Computer produced a 3,000 per-cent return for his fund’s shar eholders.Bill has not shied away from making additional investments in theNew Economy landscape. He hit a home run with AOL. He inv ested intelecommunications, generating outsized returns in Nokia and NextelCommunications. Legg Mason Capital Management is the secondlargest shar eholder in Amazon.com—second o nly to CEO Jeff Bezos.Most recently, Bill added eBay to his fund’s portfolio, reasoning that itis at an economic starting gate very similar to Microsoft’s in 1993.206 AFTERWORDBack then Microsoft was a $22 billion business that most value in-vestors thought was significantly overvalued. By the end of 2003, Micro-soft had grown to a $295 billion business. The company went up in priceover 1,000 percent, while the S&P 500 Index advanced 138 percent dur-ing the same time period.Was Microsoft a value stock in 1993? It certainly looks like it was,yet no value investor would touch it. Is eBay a value stock today? W eobviously believe it is, but we will not know for certain for some yearsto come. But one thing is clear to us: Y ou cannot determine whethereBay is a value stock by looking at its P/E any more than you could de-termine Microsoft’s valuation by looking at its P/E.At the heart of all Bill’s investment decisions is the requirement ofunderstanding a company’s business model. What are the value creators?How does the company generate cash? What level of cash can a companyproduce and what rate of growth can it expect to achieve? What is thecompany’s return on capital? If it achieves a return above the cost of cap-ital, the company is creating value. If it achieves a rate of return belowthe cost of capital, the company is destroying value.In the end, Bill’s analysis gives him a sense of what the business isworth, based largely on the discounted present value of the company’sfuture cash earnings. Although Bill’s fund owns companies that are dif-ferent from those in Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, no one candeny that they are approaching the investment process in the same way.The only difference is that Bill has decided to take the investment phi-losophy and apply it to the New Economy franchises that are rapidlydominating the global economic landscape.When Bill asked me to join Legg Mason Capital Management andbring my fund along, it was clear to me our philosophical approach wasidentical. The more important advantage of joining Bill’s team was thatnow I was part of an organization that was dedicated to applying abusiness-valuation approach to investing wherever value-creation op-portunities appeared. I was no longer limited to looking at just thestocks Buffett had purchased. The entire stock market was now openfor analysis. I guess you could say it forced me to expand my circle ofcompetence.One of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was themistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech com-panies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,Afterword 207these newly created businesses possessed more economic risk thanmany of the companies Buffett owned. The economics of soda pop,razor blades, carpets, paint, candy, and furniture are much easier topredict than the economics of computer software, telecommunica-tions, and the Internet.But “difficult to predict” is not the same as “impossible to ana-lyze.” Certainly the economics of a technology company are morevariant than those of consumer nondurable businesses. But a thought-ful study of how any business operates should still allow us to deter-mine a range of valuation possibilities. And keeping with the Buffettphilosophy, it is not critical that we determine precisely what thevalue of the company is, only that we are buying the company at a sig-nificant price discount (margin of safety) from the range of valuationpossibilities.What some Buffettologists miss in their thinking is that the payoffof being right in the analysis of technology companies more thancompensates for the risk. All we must do is analyze each stock as abusiness, determine the value of the business and, to protect againsthigher economic risk, demand a greater margin of safety in the pur-chase price.W e should not forget that over the years many devotees of WarrenBuffett’s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it todifferent parts of the stock market. Several prominent investors havebought stocks not found anywhere in Berkshire’s portfolio. Others havebought smaller-capitalization stocks. A few have taken Buffett’s approachinto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The im-portant takeaway is this: Buffett’s investment approach is applicable to alltypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitaliza-tion, regardless of where the business is domiciled.Since becoming part of Legg Mason Capital Management in 1998,my growth fund has enjoyed a remarkable period of superior invest-ment performance. The reason for this much better performance is notthat the philosophy or process changed, but that the philosophy andprocess were applied to a larger universe of stocks. When portfoliomanagers and analysts are willing to study all types of business models,regardless of industry classification, the opportunity to exploit the mar-ket’s periodic mispricing greatly expands, and this translates into betterreturns for our shareholders.208 AFTERWORDThis does not mean we do not have an occasional bad year, badquarter, or bad month. It simply means when you add up all the timeswe lost money relative to the market, using any time period, the amountof money we lost was smaller than the amount of money we made whenwe outperformed the market.In this respect, the record of this fund is not far different from otherfocused portfolios. Think back to the performance of Charlie Munger,Bill Ruane, and Lou Simpson. Each one achieved outstanding long-term performance but endured periods of short-term underperfor-mance. Each one employed a business valuation process to determinewhether stocks were mispriced. Each one ran concentrated, low-turnover portfolios. The process they used enabled them to achieve su-perior long-term results at the expense of a higher standard deviation.Michael Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Legg MasonCapital Management, conducted a study of the b est-performing mutualfunds between 1992 and 2002.1He screened for funds that had onemanager during the period, had assets of at least $1 billion, and beat theStandard & Poor’s 500 Index over the ten-year period. Thirty-one mu-tual funds made the cut.Then he looked at the process each manager used to beat the mar-ket, and isolated four attributes that set this group apart from the ma-jority of fund managers.1.Portfolio turnover. As a whole, the market-beating mutual fundshad an average turnover ratio of about 30 percent. This stands instark contrast to the turnover for all equity funds—110 percent.2.Portfolio concentration. The long-term outperformers tend tohave higher portfolio concentration than the index or other gen-eral equity funds. On average, the outperforming mutual fundsplaced 37 percent of their assets in their top ten names.3.Investment style. The vast majority of the above-market per-formers espoused an intrinsic-value approach to selecting stocks.4.Geographic location. Only a small fraction of the outperformershail from the East Coast financial centers, New Y ork orBoston. Most of the high-alpha generators set up shop in citieslike Chicago, Salt Lake City, Memphis, Omaha, and Baltimore.Michael suggests that perhaps being away from the frenetic paceof New Y ork and Boston lessens the hyperactivity that perme-ates so many mutual fund portfolios.Afterword 209A common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Super-investors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,or those who lead the funds that Michael’s research identified, is a port-folio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and astock-selection proc ess that emphasizes the discovery of a stock’s intrin-sic value.Still, with all the evidence on how to generate above-average longresults, a vast majority of money managers continue to underperformthe stock market. Some believe this is evidence of market efficiency.Perhaps with the intense competition among money managers, stocksare more accurately priced. This may be partly true. W e believe themarket has become more efficient, and there are fewer opportunities toextract profits from the stock market using simple-minded techniquesto determine value. Surely no one still believes the market is going toallow you to pick its pocket simply by calculating a P/E ratio.Analysts who understand the deep-rooted changes unfolding in abusiness model will likely discover valuation anomalies that appear in themarket. Those analysts will have a different view of the duration andmagnitude of the company’s cash-generating ability compared with themarket’s view. “That the S&P 500 has also beaten other active moneymanagers is not an argument against active money management,” saidBill Miller; “it is an argument against the methods employed by mostactive money managers.”2/tile3It has been twenty years since I read my first B erkshire Hathaway an-nual report. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his phi-losophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world ofinvesting. There is no doubt in my mind that the process is sound and,if consistently applied, will generate above-average long-term results.W e have only to observe today’s best-in-class money managers to seethat they are all using varied forms of Buffett’s investment approach.Although companies, industries, markets, and economies will al-ways evolve over time, the value of Buffett’s investment philosophy liesin its timelessness. No matter what the condition, investors can applyBuffett’s approach to selecting stocks and managing portfol ios.When Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused210 AFTERWORDportfolios. When he added the new economic franchises to Berkshire’sportfolio in the 1970s and 1980s, he was still thinking about stocks asbusinesses and managing a focused portfolio. When Bill Miller boughttechnology and Internet companies for his value fund in the 1990s andinto the first half of this decade, he was thinking about stocks as busi-nesses and managing a focused portfolio.W ere the companies purchased in the 1950s different from the com-panies in the 1980s? Yes. W ere the companies purchased in the 1960s dif-ferent from those purchased in 1990s? Of course they were. Businesseschange, industries unfold, and the competitiveness of markets allows neweconomic franchises to be born while others slowly wither. Throughoutthe constant evolution of markets and companies, it should be comfortingfor investors to realize there is an investment process that remains robusteven against the inevitable forces of change.At Berskhire’s 2004 annual meeting, a shar eholder asked Warrenwhether, looking back, he would change anything about his approach.“If we were to do it over again, we’d do it pretty much the same way,”he answered. “W e’d read ever ything in sight about businesses and indus-tries. Working with far less capital, our investment universe would be farbroader than it is currently. I would continually learn the basic principlesof sound investing which are Ben Graham’s, affected in a significant wayby Charlie and Phil Fisher in terms of looking at better businesses.” Hepaused for a moment, then added, “Ther e’s nothing different, in myview, about analyzing securities today versus fifty years ago.”Nor will there be anything different five, ten, or twenty years fromnow. Markets change, prices change, economic environments change,industries come and go. And smart investors change their day-to-daybehavior to adapt to the changing context. What does not change, how-ever, are the fundamentals.Those who follow Buffett’s way will still analyze stocks (and com-panies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;and will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that theprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett’s investment decisions forsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solidinvestment wisdom on which all of us may build.211AppendixTable A.1 Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,300 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 33,4011,969,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 33,033592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 17,187220,000 Capital Cities Communications, Inc. 10,909 13,2281,294,308 GEICO Common Stock 4,116 10,516324,580 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. 11,218 9,981226,900 Knight-Ridder Newspapers 7,534 8,736170,800 Ogilvy & Mather International 2,762 6,9601,305,800 Kaiser Industries, Inc. 778 6,039Total $ 71,893 $139,081All other common stocks 34,996 41,992Total common stocks $106,889 $181,073Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1977 Annual Report.Note: Dollar amounts are in thousands.212Table A.2 Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value934,000 The Washington Post Company $ 10,628 $ 43,4451,986,953 GEICO Convertible Preferred 19,417 28,314953,750 SAFECO Corporation 23,867 26,467592,650 Interpublic Group of Companies 4,531 19,0391,066,934 Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. 18,085 18,671453,800 Knight-Ridder Newspapers 7,534 10,2671,294,308 GEICO Common Stock 4,116 9,060246,450 American Broadcasting Companies 6,082 8,626Total $ 94,260 $163,889All other common stocks 39,506 57,040Total common stocks $133,766 $220,929Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Annual Report.Note: Dollar amounts are in thousands.Table A.3 Berkshire Hathaway 1979 Common Stock PortfolioNumber Marketof Shares Company Cost Value5,730,114 GEICO Corp.

The purchase price is often quoted as $22 billion, and in a sense that is true.The two companies announced in June 1998 that Berkshire would acquireall General Re shares at a 29 percent prem ium over the closing share price,by trading an equivalent value in B erkshire stock. But six months passed be-fore the deal finally closed, and by that time both share prices had declined.General Re shareholders received $204.40 for each share they owned, ratherthan the $276.50 value the shares had back in June. The actual purchaseNotes 227price was thus approximately $16 billion in Berkshire stock, instead of $22billion. Kilpatrick, Of Permanent Value (2000), 18.5.

In year one, 1988, owner earnings were $828 million; by year ten,they will be $4.349 billion. Starting with year eleven, growth will slow to 5percent per year, the second stage. In year eleven, owner earnings will equal$3.516 billion ($3.349 billion ×5 percent +$3.349 billion). Now, we cansubtract this 5 percent growth rate from the risk-free rate of return (9 per-cent) and reach a capitalization r ate of 4 percent. The discounted value of acompany with $3.516 billion in owner earnings capi talized at 4 percent is$87.9 billion. Since this value, $87.9 billion, is the discounted value of Coca-Cola’s owner earnings in year eleven, we next have to discount this futurevalue by the discount factor at the end of year ten [1/(1 +.09)10] =.4224. Thepresent value of the residual value of Coca-Cola in year ten is $37.129 bil-lion. The value of Coca-Cola then equals its residual value ($37.129 billion)plus the sum of the pre sent value of cash flows during this period ($11.248billion), for a total of $48.377 billion.Notes 2316.

Legg Mason quarterly market commentary, January 25, 1999.235AcknowledgmentsTo begin, I want to express my deep gratitude to Warren Buffett forhis teachings and for allowing me to use his copyrighted material.It is next to impossible to improve on what Warren has alreadysaid. This book is the better for being able to use his own words insteadof subjecting you to a second-best paraphrase.Thanks also to Charlie Munger for his contributions to the study ofinvesting. His ideas on the “psychology of misjudgment” and the “lat-ticework of mental models” are extremely important and should be ex-amined by all. My appreciation to Charlie also includes thanks for histhoughtful conversations and his earliest word of encouragement andsupport.In the development of my investment skills, no one has been moreimportant in moving me from the theoretical to the practical than BillMiller. Bill has been my friend and intellectual coach for over twentyyears. His generosity is unmatched. As CEO of Legg Mason CapitalManagement, Bill has taken me by the hand and showed me how toapply Warren Buffett’s approach to all types of companies, includingthose participating in the landscapes of the New Economy. What is par-ticularly exciting for me is that Bill is not only a friend and teacher, butalso a colleague.I am also fortunate to work in an environment that supports andpromotes rational investing. And so I would like to thank all my col-leagues at Legg Mason including Nancy Dennin, Mary Chris Gay, ErnieKiehne, Kyle Legg, Ira Malis, Michael Mauboussin, Jennifer Murphy,236 ACKNOWLEDGMENTSDavid Nelson, Randy Befumo, Scot Labin, Jay Leopold, SamanthaMcLemore, Mitchell Penn, Dale W ettflaufer, and Jean Yu.Over the years, I have benefited greatly from sharing numerousconversations about Warren Buffett with many thoughtful people. Thelist includes Bob Coleman, Tom Russo, Chris Davis, David Winters,Jamie Clark, Bill Ruane, Bob Goldfarb, Lou Simpson, Ajit Jain, LisaRapuano, Alice Schroeder, Chuck Akre, Al Barr, David Braverman,Wally W eitz, Mason Hawkins, Larry Pidgeon, and Ed Thorp.Several people assisted me in the research for sections of the book.Thank you, Justin Green, Joan Lamm-Tennant, Pat Shunk, Michael Lev-itan, Stewart Davis, Mary Mcl augh, John Fitzgerald, and Linda Penfold.Several prominent investors supported the book in its earliest pe-riod. My great thanks to Peter Lynch, John Rothchild, Jack Bogle, PhilFisher, Ken Fisher, and Ed Haldeman.Over the years, I have had the pleasure of interacting with severalwriters who in their own way are also Buffett experts. A specialthanks to Andy Kilpatrick, who in my judgment is the official histo-rian of Berkshire Hathaway. Thanks also to Roger Lowenstein, HenryEmerson, Janet Lowe, Carol Loomis, and Larry Cunni ngham.Three talented and supersmart young women have been extraordi-narily helpful in the creation in the book, each doing a specialized pieceof research and manuscript development. Warm thanks to Ericka Peter-son, Cathy Coladonato, and Victoria Larson.With all the appreciation I have previously given, none could matchthe gratitude I owe my writing partner, Maggie Stuckey. Although wework at opposite ends of the continent, Maggie has an uncanny knackof getting inside my head and knowing exactly what I wish to commu-nicate, often before I do. She is a dedicated professional who workedtirelessly to improve this book; I am fortunate to have her on my side.My relationship with John Wiley & Sons has been always pleasur-able. Myles Thompson, my friend and editor, championed The WarrenBuffett Way when nobody had heard about it and not one copy hadbeen sold. Thanks, Myles. I also thank Joan O’Neil, Pamela van Giessen,Mary Daniello, and the other publishing professionals at John Wiley fortheir care and attention to my writings on Warren Buffett.I am greatly indebted to my agent, Laurie Harper at Sebastian Liter-ary Agency. Laurie is, in a word, special. She does her job with honesty,loyalty, integrity, intelligence, and warm humor. I could not be in bet terAcknowledgments 237hands. A word of appreciation, too, to the late Michael Cohn for takinga chance on a first-time writer ten years ago.Anyone who has sat down to write a book knows that meanscountless hours spent alone that otherwise could be spent with family.My wife Maggie is a constant source of love and support. On the firstday I told her I was going to write this book, she smiled and convincedme that it could be done. Over the following months, she cared for ourfamily, giving me the luxury of time to write. Love without end to mychildren, Kim, Robert, and John, and to my wife, who makes all thingspossible for me. Even though they come l ast in this list, they are foreverfirst in my heart.For all that is good and right about this book, you may thankthe people I have mentioned. For any errors or omissions, I alone amresponsible.R. G.
