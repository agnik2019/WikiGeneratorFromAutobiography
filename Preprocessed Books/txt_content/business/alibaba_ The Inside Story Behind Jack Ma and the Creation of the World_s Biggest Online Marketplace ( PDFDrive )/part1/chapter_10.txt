chapter 10Keep It Up! Reorganization  and IPOIn 2007 Alibaba underwent a major reorganization prepara-tory to raising money by listing part of the company on the Hong Kong stock exchange. An um-brella parent called the Alibaba Group became the repository for several of the afﬁliated Alibaba companies, including 75 percent of the B2B online marketplace called Alibaba.com. On November 6, 17 percent of Alibaba.com was sold to public shareholders, with 75 percent retained by the parent company, the Alibaba Group, and 8 percent by employees, management, and consultants.192The parent A libaba Grou p is in turn owne d 39 percent by Ya-hoo!, 29 percent by Softbank, and 32 percent by management and employees. Alibaba.com is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a location o f choice for man y Asian com panies. Han gzhou Alibaba Advertising Co., Lt d., is incorporate d in the Peop le’s Repu blic of China and holds the Internet content provider (ICP) license that allows A libaba to do its Internet business in C hina. Wit h 80 percent o f shares, Jac k Ma is in contro l of Hangz hou Alibaba, and Simon Xie, one of the early founders of Alibaba, holds the other 20 percent. Wit hout licenses from t his China-based entit y, Ali-baba, as an o ffshore-based entity, cou ld not operate as an Internet company within China .To  prepare for this reor ganization, a new mana gement team was insta lled at A libaba in Novem ber 2006. T he new CEO of Alibaba.com, in charge of all Alibaba’s B2B business, is David Wei. Wei comes from outsi de the Alibaba fold: he previous ly headed China’s largest home improvement retai ler, so he understan ds the buying and selling side of the business from the customer per -spective. A new CFO, Ma ggie Wu, was a lso hired from outsi de to handle Alibaba.com’s ﬁnances. Wu previous ly was an au dit part-ner at KPMG’s Beijing ofﬁce .The Alibaba.com IPO re presente d the secon d largest Inter -net IPO in history, despite being a pu blic offering for less than one-ﬁfth of only one part of the Alibaba Group. The largest was that of Goo gle, which raised $1.67 billion. A fter listing, Alibaba.com’s stoc k soon tra ded at HKD 39.50, up from t he offer price of HKD 13.50 ($1.74 ). As of mid-2008, Alibaba.com was trad -ing in the neighborhood of HKD 10. In dustry evaluations o f the company overa ll are positive. A libaba.com’s paying customer base is increasing very quickly, it enjoys over 80 percent gross margins, its business mo del is wor king, and its cas h ﬂow is exce llent.These high marks can be attri buted to the way in w hich Alibaba was reorganized prior to the listing. Lesser-margin busi -Keep It Up! Reorganization and IPO 193nesses were kept outside the ﬁnancials of the listed company. At the same time, the sister entities continue to contribute to the overall critical mass of Alibaba’s business. Jack Ma is intent on allowing lower-margin businesses to look to a strategic future, rather than force them into the straitjacket of quarterly earnings reports. In general, the reorganization and the listing have been well received.Three major investment banks shepherded the process of taking Alibaba into a new era: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank. Jack Ma’s martial arts moves may have pro-vided the framework of the deal—the “bones,” as it were—but the basic concept was helped considerably by the professional attention of these three. Alibaba.com was incorporated in Sep-tember 2006 as a holding company for the B2B businesses of the Alibaba Group. Taobao, Alibaba, and Alipay were split off as sepa-rate entities, though still under the overarching structure of the Alibaba Group. Unlike the acquisition of Yahoo! China, which was accomplished privately and quickly and without the com-plexities of public scrutiny, the listing process was carefully guided by highly technical expertise.Reorganizing the company to separate high-margin busi-nesses from low-margin ones had the immediate effect of gaining a tremendous cushion of capital. The Alibaba Group has made no public decision regarding whether to inject other group assets into the Alibaba.com listed company. Separating the businesses may help the Alibaba Group pursue its strategic goal of dominating e-commerce-related activities, including marketplaces, payments, search, and advertising—in China and elsewhere—by allowing its unlisted units to focus on market growth rather than proﬁtability. This is very much in line with Jack Ma’s general philosophy.Alibaba.com has entered a ﬁeld that few but industry profes-sionals understand very well. The activities of Internet companies include several key money-making components, including paid 194search, online mar ketplace, tra de media, an d socia l networ king. Alibaba.com is involved in all of these. Its primary competitors in the search market in China are Baidu and Google. In the consumer online mar ketplace, the parent com pany is going head-to-head, most important ly, wit h eBay. Bai du and Alibaba.com both act as listing tools for small and medium-sized enterprises, but Baidu offers these com panies ex posure on ly in China, w hereas A libaba.com o ffers them global exposure. Bai du serves both wholesalers and retailers, whereas Alibaba.com serves only wholesalers. In the B2B online mar ketplace arena, A libaba.com now holds 60 per-cent o f its mar ket share in China.In industry jargon, Alibaba operates online networks that de -rive va lue from t heir mem bers’ interactions. A libaba is sai d to be the clear mar ket leader wor ldwide with a critica l mass in w hat is known as a “network effects” business. The magical thing about networ k effects is t hat they grow t hemselves. Li ke a cr ystal or any ot her self-organizing structure, t hey self-accrete wit hout hav-ing to be created laboriously, bit by bit. As a result, the idea of a networ k effects business ﬁts perfectly with Jack Ma’s renowne d appreciation for the idea of being lazy.The reality, however, is that there is nothing lazy about Ali -baba. The networ k that Alibaba offers re lates primari ly to com -merce, an d selling that idea to customers requires tremen dous sales force participation. In point of fact, Alibaba’s is a labor-intensive mo del. The sales force at t he com pany now tota ls more than twenty- ﬁve hundred peop le. Sales ofﬁces were opene d insixteen cities in China prior to 2007 and in another fourteen cit -ies in 2007. As o f June 30, 2007, t he tota l number of full-time A li-baba emp loyees came to forty-four hundred. Jack Ma an d those employees run very hard to keep the coffers full.Keep It Up! Reorganization and IPO 195The Business ModelAlibaba makes money by charging customers for membership services. Alibaba.com operates international (English-language) and domestic (Chinese-language) online marketplaces, which charge companies, primarily small companies, to list products on-line. Buyers can go online and browse these products for free: suppliers therefore have twenty-four-hour access to a global au-dience. As of June 2007, Alibaba.com hosted 2.4 million supplier storefronts, with, on average, 2.9 million new product listings per month. Buyers click on product listings and are taken to suppliers’ storefronts. Buyers are allowed onsite for free, but Alibaba charges fees for services to sellers. Because of the free access, Alibaba states that “together our marketplaces form a community of more than 24 million registered users from over 200 countries and regions.”Some three-quarters of Alibaba.com’s income derives from its international, English-language-based marketplace. One-quarter comes from the domestic, Chinese-language-based marketplace. The basic price of services in the English-language marketplace is, in 2008, around $6,500. Around twenty-two thousand China Suppliers are currently registered as members and pay this price. Alibaba started charging for its English-language marketplace ser-vices in the year 2000. The basic price of services in the China-language domestic marketplace is a little less than $400. Alibaba started charging for domestic services in 2002; now nearly 222,000 suppliers are currently registered and pay this price.In addition to basic membership services, those companies that select additional value-added services are charged extra. For example, International TrustPass members pay $589 per year for TrustPass services. Some 13 percent of these are customers from the United States, 16 percent are from Hong Kong, 11 percent from Taiwan, 8 percent from India, and 6 percent from Korea. All contracts for value-added services for suppliers are for one to two 196years, an d all must be paid in advance. T his is highly beneﬁcial to Alibaba’s cash ﬂow; revenues are amortized over the period for which they are contracted.Alibaba’s business mo del takes advantage of the fact that China has been an d continues to be the primary pro duct sup -plier to the world. As mentioned previously, some four-ﬁfths of the com panies su pplying products to t he wor ld from C hina are small- and medium-size d enterprises, an d there are a bout 32 mi l-lion such enterprises in China. Of these, a small percentage, per -haps 2 to 3 mi llion, actua lly export. A libaba therefore focuses on the top o f this enormous pyrami d of small companies—in ot her words, those savvy and nimble enough to get their products to global markets. The rest o f the 32 mi llion com panies, however, are also part o f the process, for they supp ly to the top-o f-the-pyrami d global suppliers. These companies may also list on Alibaba, but for free. A libaba provides a venue not just for paying suppliers but for any supp lier who wants to post very basic in formation, gratis, on the site. It therefore is able to provide buyers with information on over 10 mi llion su ppliers.Domestic tra de within China among sma ll and medium-size d enterprises, quite apart from exported goods, totaled some $530 billion in 2 007. The mar ket researc h ﬁrm iResearc h estimates t hat this ﬁgure wi ll continue to grow at 15 percent per year. T he same organization estimates that the import and export trade volume of small enter prises in C hina was $1.7 tri llion in 2007 an d that it will continue to grow at 20 percent per year. T hese num bers are the base upon which Alibaba builds its business. Alibaba has already developed a critica l mass o f buyers an d suppliers on its marketplace, w hich is the largest in t he wor ld.Financials of the listed company are therefore excellent. Y ear-on-year growth in net income is forecast at over 200 percent in 2008, building on a simi lar increase in 2007, t hough declining to mere double digits in 2009 and 2010. Revenues increased 85 per -Keep It Up! Reorganization and IPO 197cent year-on-year in 2006 and 61 percent in the ﬁrst half of 2007. Margins remain high, approaching 50 percent prior to stock-based compensation. Since members are ﬁckle and the turnover rate remains high, the key to this ferocious growth is continued sales of memberships and value-added services to new members.One might wonder why suppliers would pay to be listed on Alibaba if they could post their products for free. The rea-son relates to Alibaba’s services. These include authentication and veriﬁcation of buyers’ credentials, cheaper access to the payment platform Alipay, help in creation of Web sites or storefronts, and ability to get to the front of the line in terms of response to cus-tomers’ inquiries. One of the new services, which points to trends to come, is the ability to take out loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on the basis of one’s trade volume on Alibaba. Overall, Alibaba’s strategy is to convert nonpaying sup-pliers to paying ones by offering irresistible value-added beneﬁts.Large buyers such as Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart typically replace around 20 percent of the suppliers that sell to them every year. This degree of uncertainty is highly destabilizing to small suppliers. Alibaba has therefore served a use-ful function for all who need the stability of an ongoing market. At the same time, Alibaba is increasingly used by larger buyers as well, who do initial screening of offerings on the Internet. T ypical buyers on Alibaba.com include importers, trading companies, the procurement departments of manufacturing companies, and the sourcing departments of retailers.Alipay is a critical part of the Alibaba scheme. The company is not part of the listed Alibaba.com, but Alibaba.com receives fees if transactions are paid for via Alipay. As noted above, Alibaba.com receives 60 percent to 85 percent of the consequent fees. Monetizing transactions has been how eBay and other Internet companies make money. Alibaba has resisted a model that charges for every transaction, but by channeling payments through Ali-198pay, Alibaba success fully earns a percenta ge of transactions as we ll. Whether or not Alibaba will start charging direct transaction fees remains to be seen. The relationship between Alibaba and Alipay makes it c lear that as t he digital conver gence procee ds, the wor ld will also witness a convergence o f the ﬁnancia l and IT sectors. China’s banking and ﬁnancial industry is highly regulated. It is also in t he midst of regulatory ﬂux as Western banks enter t he market and Chinese banks gear up for more c hallenging compe-tition. As a Chinese company, Jack Ma’s Alibaba is in a favorable position to beneﬁt from t he open environment o f global ﬁnance as we ll as the protecte d environment o f a Chinese home base.Looking Forwar dCreating Alibaba has required two key talents: an ability to rec -ognize the direction of technolo gy and a determination to force its pace. It re quired an ability to rea d future moves on t he weiqiboard: to understand how technology is linked to human social organization and how to levera ge small moves into lar ge conse -quences. As A libaba moves farther into t he global arena ( possibly through a future afﬁliation with Microsoft), it will be interesting to see how Jack Ma plays his next moves. All e yes will be on the wuxia master. W hatever happens, t he scra ppy little boy turne d master performer is not likely to disappoint his audience.Jack Ma’s Personal Chronology (with Key Events in China’s Recent History)1911   End of imperial China’s Qing dynasty1937   Invasion of China by Japan and start of Anti-Japanese War1945   End of World War II, including defeat of Japan in China1945–49   Civil War in China between Communist Party and Kuomintang1949   Founding of  People’s Republic of China on October 1 (start of Communist rule in China)2001958 Great Lea p Forward (radical economicpolicies pursued by Mao Zedong)1959–61 Three Y ears o f Natura l Disaster (famine in China )Sept. 10, 1964 Jack Ma is born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, C hina1966 –76 Cultural Revolution in China (intense socialturmoil)1972 Nixon goes to C hina1976 Death of Chairman Mao Zedon g;
