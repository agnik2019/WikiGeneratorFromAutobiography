On coming to govern in October 1917, \nthey had expected to squeeze power in the party's fist. The party was ceasing to operate as a distinct \norganisation. His \nnotion was that party life should be revived and that the committees of \nthe party at each level of government should regularly and closely \nsupervise the several governmental agencies. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917. Their report called unambiguously for the party to \nreinforce its institutional control. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov.21 But the usefulness of inner subcommittees was not \ndenied, and a further experiment was undertaken in early October 1918 \nwhen a 'Bureau of the Central Committee' began to meet.22 On 16 \nJanuary 1919 the Central Committee met and established an \nOrganisational Bureau (or Orgburo) to take charge of internal party \nbusiness.23 The Orgburo quickly \nbecame a fixture in the central party apparatus.44 \nAnd yet he did not want the central party apparatus, despite their \nrivalry, to fall apart.49 \nSverdlov's death gave impetus for a re-organisation of the central \nparty apparatus. Even the \nfact that the German Social-Democratic Party won more seats - 163 \nout of a possible 421 51 -\nthan any other party in the Constituent \nAssembly elections of January 1919 and formed a coalition with non-\nsocialist parties had the advantage that, in time, social-democrats could \nbe exposed as having connived in capitalism's survival. 52 \nThis attempt to sow dissent in the leadership of a rival party lay \nunpublished.

Lenin stoutly \ndefended this tradition.1 \nLenin reinforced his emphasis upon organisational control and \nideological 'purity'; he discerned no other antidote to the dissolute and \ndissolving conditions he diagnosed. Lenin's campaign against them in the \nCentral Committee was relentless. \n175 \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe involuntary emigration of leaders like himself called for some \ninstitutional re-organisation. Four Bolsheviks were \nparticularly active: Dubrovinski, Goldenberg, Nogin and Rozhkov.3 Bolsheviks exploited their advantage.4 By contrast Social-Democrat, which was intended \nto serve the party as a whole, was reduced by the Bolshevik-Menshevik \nstrife to only fitful publication both then and in the following year. The Bolsheviks' influence was diminished. \nThis was not to Lenin's liking. But it should not be assumed that \nBolshevik opinion in general took his attitude. There was much, in any \nevent, for the Bolsheviks to be pleased about.8 \nBut such committees often had little contact with rank-and-file \nmembers; Dan and Martov challenged the Bolsheviks to put their \nposition to the test of a Party Congress.9 \nYet the Russian social-democrats incurring Lenin's fiercest wrath \nwere found among his own Bolsheviks. l2 Maksim Gorki strove to effect a reconcilia-\ntion between Lenin and Bogdanov.13 Unlike \nBogdanov, Lenin for some time refused. Lenin and Bogdanov, with Dubrov-\ninski, were Proletari's editors. Ignoring Gorki's peace-making \ngestures, Lenin made clear that he would shortly engage in an attack \nupon Bogdanov's philosophical writings. The intra-Bolshevik truce \nabout philosophy was to be terminated. Coaxed out to Capri in April \n1908, Lenin rejected any compromise with his former partner; he was \nalso worried lest all Bolsheviks should become branded by Plekhanov \nas renegades from Marxist philosphical 'orthodoxy' by virtue of being \nin the same faction as Bogdanov. Lenin's political views might be seen \nas 'heretical' by the guilt of association with Bogdanov.14 \nLenin spent several weeks in the British Museum beginning the \npreparation of his onslaught. When Lenin rallied to \nDubrovinski's side, Bogdanov resigned from Proletari (though not \nfrom the Bolshevik Centre) rather than submit to further editorial \nhumiliation.16 First blood to Lenin. \nYet the Bolshevik Centre declined to appoint any of Lenin's \nconfederates in Bogdanov's stead.19 This was too strong for Lenin's taste, but \nnot to the extent that he could not work with Shantser. He resolved to quit the Bolshevik faction altogether \nshould Recallism win a majority in the Centre.20 Meanwhile he plotted \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrategy for the Fifth Party Conference, due to meet in Paris on 21 \nDecember 1908.21 But Lenin was by no means contented. 22 \nLenin would move heaven and earth to get Bogdanov removed from \nthe Bolshevik Centre. \n'MATERIALISM AND EMPIRIOCRITICISM' \nThe product of Lenin's philosophical studies was Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. \nLenin's assault took a year to prepare. It appeared in April 1909. \nLenin's sister Anna, who handled the book's legal publication in \nRussia (under his old nom de plume ofV. \nPlekhanov and Lenin regarded this as anti-Marxist.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders). Marxism, according to \n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPlekhanov and Lenin, held that the universe exists independently of \nhuman perception. Plekhanov, with Lenin's approval, obliged. Nor, for that matter, did Bogdanov address himself to Lenin's \nquotation of Engels on the subject of materialists. There is justice in Bogdanov's claim to be closer than \nLenin and Plekhanov to Marxian epistemological theory. Views on the question of \nthe independent existence of the external world still differ; but Lenin's \nattitude undoubtedly has strong current backing.42 \n Doubts and Certainties \n181 \nLenin's epistemological optimism was extreme.44 Lenin thought \nPlekhanov to have introduced an unnecessarily indeterminate factor.45 Lenin's more \ndefiant opposition to Bogdanov was buttressed by points that were not \nstrictly epistemological. Lenin, following Engels, asserted that there \nwere essentially only two possible positions in epistemology: \nmaterialism and idealism. But rather than positions Lenin spoke of \n'parties' . Lenin proceeded to a third point.49 \nFor his part, Lenin stated that Kapital was eternally true.51 In his \ngeneral offensive against Plekhanovite epistemology, he included \nparticular attacks on Lenin. He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes.52 He also tackled Lenin's points on the beliefs \nof scientists, on 'party-mindedness', on religion.53 Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence.54 Lenin hoped to intimidate. The essence of Lenin's position was that Marx's \nwritings were un assail ably true. Furthermore, Lenin's description of the attain-\nment of absolute truth was not only un-Marxist: it was also absurd.57 \nEvidently these mutual criticisms by Lenin and Bogdanov were not \nmerely about cognitive psychology. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. The veracity of an idea, asserted \nLenin, was not increased in proportion to the rise in the number of \npersons believing it. Through the doctrines of Marx and \nEngels, according to Lenin, the party could explain reality to the \nmasses and win them over to the revolutionary cause.62 It was up to \nthe workers themselves to start to develop a 'proletarian' ideology, \nusing Marxism as a broad guide, to carry the revolutionary process \nonward.6a \nLenin saw Bogdanov's case as an unwarranted attack upon the \nintelligentsia (even though he himself had had harsh words about it in \nthe past); he also had a higher regard for the scientific and cultural \nachievements of capitalism than Bogdanov.64 Yet Lenin refused to be \ndrawn further, limiting himself to the implicit argumentation of \nMaterialism. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done.65 \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. Here Lenin was pushing his luck. Materialism \ncontained several acidic statements about Plekhanov's works, and \nPlekhanov's friends unsurprisingly replied to Lenin in kind in their \nreviews.66 In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after 1909, Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions.67 Lenin and Plekhanov had no intention of abandoning illegal \nparty activity.68 The niceties of this policy did \nnot interest Lenin and Plekhanov. \nNeither Lenin nor Plekhanov ceased to object to each other's \n Doubts and Certainties \n185 \nprogrammatic intentions in other areas.71 \nLenin, however, shifted his ground.72 He reportedly \neven toyed with the suggestion to accord voting rights to affiliated \nunions at Party Congresses on a parity with the normal underground \ncommittees;73 But he had second thoughts, perhaps recoiling from a \nplan which would infringe the principle of the party's hegemony of the \nlabour movement (or perhaps simply because he foresaw insuperable \nopposition from his own section of the Bolshevik faction). Lenin's objective \nwas clear. The Bolsheviks V. Taratuta handed over his fortune, or a goodly \nportion of it, to Lenin.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On 8 February \n1909 Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n1904. The scene was set \nfor a final confrontation at a meeting of the editorial board of the \nBolshevik newspaper Proletari; all members of the Bolshevik Centre \nwere to be invited.76 \nThe board meeting, lasting from 8 to 17 June, was basically a \nconference of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin proposed a resolution \ncondemning Recallism and Ultimatumism. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin declared: 'There is nothing worse than an absence of open \nstruggle'.77 Recallism and Ultimatum ism were denounced as being \nun-Bolshevik; it was urged that a 'decisive fight' be begun with all such \n'deviations from the path of revolutionary Marxism'. Still moving \nwith Lenin, the meeting approved Dubrovinski's motion seeking an \nalliance with Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin approved. \nWith the departure of Bogdanov on 12 June, Lenin had won his \nvictory. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. Delegates from Russia felt that \nLenin's editorial policy had given too much space to theoretical \ndisquisitions; they urged the creation of a popular workers' daily.83 This was bad enough for Lenin. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks.84 Lenin's reservations were ignored. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. The Bolshevik leadership chose A. Lyubimov had taken a \nconstant stand against Lenin's divisive tactics.88 He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Lenin could have been forgiven for feeling \nnostalgic about his earlier years in Switzerland. Apparently the \nBolshevik Centre was finding it difficult to secure parity of editorial \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority over the Viennese Pravda; Lenin urged Lyubimov to stand \nfirm.92 It was Lenin's hope that Trotski would be discouraged from \nfurther co-operation with the Bolsheviks.94 \nLenin then exercised the little power left to him in Paris.95 Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June 1909. It occurred, moreover, at a moment \nwhen Lenin's own financial management was coming under scrutiny. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary.97 Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. 10o Lenin was furious. Nobody has been able to show that Recallism \nhad more than very slight support in Russia in late 1909; and the \nUltimatumists had in any case never stood very distant from Lenin's \nown attitude to Duma deputies: he had always urged that the \nsocial-democratic fraction comply with Central Committee policies.l04 \nThe Bolshevik Centre set itself the task of pulling the entire \nsocial-democratic movement together under its leadership. Lenin had \nsustained an organisational set-back. Unlike Lenin, \nhe wished to see representatives of all Bolsheviks and all Mensheviks \nworking together in the Central Committee; his other priority was to \nre-establish the Central Committee's organisational presence in \nRussia. Bolshevik leaders in Russia supported him.l07 A meeting of the \nBolshevik Centre was held in Paris on 1 November. Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. Lenin's tactics were \nakin to those of a general who, receiving reconnaissance information \nthat conditions are unfavourable for an offensive, nevertheless goes \nthrough with it on the grounds that inactivity is bad for the morale of \nthe troops. Lenin had few \ntroops. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' . The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself.113 The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation.114 His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune 1909 was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. \nREPUTATION AND STATURE \nAs we leave Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-Lenin in his fortieth year, after the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, we note that his impact on \nthe party had never been smaller, his prestige never lower. If he had died in 1910, \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. It was tacitly understood that figures like \nPlekhanov, Martov, Maslov, Bogdanov, Trotski and Lenin had earned \nthemselves a position above the rest of the leadership. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n191 \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n1905-6. And it was largely because \nLenin in 1909 continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths.ll7 Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory. Lenin, it had been \nsaid, was quintessentially a 'voluntarist' who would not recognise \nenvironmental constraints.ll9 By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n1908-9 accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism.122 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThus what was left of Lenin's positive reputation abroad had come to \nrest upon his ideas and his writings. And, when police files were seized in 1917, the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late 1909 \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). Even Stalin, who was operating in the oil-town of \nBaku and who was not unknown for a penchant for vehement \npolemics, thought that Lenin had overdone his assault on Bogdanov.126 \nThis fall-off in the appreciation of his qualities irritated Lenin, but \ndid not crush him. \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted.129 Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after 1905. Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir I1ich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early 1910 was not uniformly sombre. He had to win back his Bolsheviks. He had never, not even \nin late 1903, held a monopoly of power in the Bolshevik faction,132 and \nseveral of his strategic aims had persistently been rejected by his \nco-factionalists.133 It is true, too, that several portions of his writing \nmerely summarised general opinion amongst Bolsheviks and were \nbereft of originality.

The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in 1910, none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:1d in store for him. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility. 1 In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. Liquidators \nand Ultimatumists were detested equally by Lenin, who wanted both \na strengthening of the illegal committees and the flexible use of the \nDuma as a forum for party propaganda. 2 \nOther Bolsheviks at the plenum had not demurred at the plenum's \ndecisions. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party.3 \n All or Nothing \n3 \nImmediately after the plenum, Lenin started to pick the locks. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. He announced \nthat the Bolsheviks would re-establish a factional organ, which he \nwanted to call The Workers' Newspaper. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. \nMany fellow Bolsheviks among the Marxist emigres distrusted his \nintense anti-Menshevism, and these still desired party unity. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned.9 Only a few close supporters, such as Grigori Zinoviev \nwanted an organisational split, and even he was far from approving \nthe whole gamut of Lenin's proposals to deal with non-Bolshevik \ngroups in the party. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. The Central Committee \nhad created an inner subcommittee, the Russian Bureau, to direct its \naffairs from inside the empire; and two further Bolsheviks belonging \nto it were arrested at the end of the same year. 14 Bolsheviks remained \non the Central Committee, but none of these were enthusiasts for \nLenin's factionalism. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. 17 \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. \nLenin punched back. Again Lenin aimed his blows low.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all. Trotski's emigre journalism, with \narticles excoriating the 'Leninists' for their intransigence and \nsectarianism, increased his influence.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. This was not Lenin's conscious intention. 27 Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance. 29 Trotski's ideas were distorted \nby his Bolshevik critics: he continued to assert that both violent and \npeaceful political methods ought to be undertaken by the party. 30 \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept.31 \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. Lyubimov, and the Pole Leo Jogiches, had held the \nring at the meeting, and Lenin went on complaining of their \nprominence. The resistance to Lenin's \nonslaughts in the following months was bound to be weaker; and the \ncomposition of the forthcoming Party Conference was ever likelier to \nproduce a triumph for him. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom.43 \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication.44 \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May 1911 meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices.45 He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted.48 \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin.49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. Lenin \nwas an inveterate pedagogue and spoke in the characteristic pose of a \nschoolmaster, with thumbs pressed hard into the armholes of his \nwaistcoat. He delivered fifty-six lectures at Longjumeau, his topics \nincluding general disquisitions on political economy as well as more \ndetailed offerings on his favourite theme: the agrarian question in the \nRussian empire. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. 55 Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. The fact \nthat in I91 0 there were only about I 0,000 organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions, 56 did not depress him.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'. 60 \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless;61 and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness.62 Trots-\nki's explanation was that the Marxist movement was dominated by \nintellectuals. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). Lenin's refusal to reply \ndirectly to Trotski's argument convinced his enemies that his \npersistent schismatism had no intellectually respectable rationale; \nthey increasingly regarded him as a would-be Nietzschean 'super-\nman'. \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition.68 But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug. The legally-published St \nPetersburg Marxist newspaper Luch ('Ray') railed against 'the \ndictatorship in the party of supermen with a cynical attitude to the \nmasses'.69 This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n11 \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.'70 Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. Instead he \ntalked about the destiny of 'the proletariat', not about his own; and \nhe tried to submerge his identity in the cause of the Marxist \nrevolutionary movement, proclaiming that 'we, the workers' were \nmarching towards a world socialist order. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole.73 In vain Lenin put the following proposition to \nhim: 'One cannot sit between two stools; it's a matter of being either \nfor or against the Liquidators'.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'. 77 Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption. Lenin had written fly-sheets for workers in the \n1890s; and his pamphlet 'To the Village Poor' in 1900 was a model of \nits kind.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them. There is no trace in \nLenin's writings of the gossip about the empress Aleksandra, and he \nsaid little even about the self-styled 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted.85 It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence.87 Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A.88 Lenin had made no such retraction; on the contrary, he \nhad asserted that the new figures bolstered his original case. The \nepisode is yet another sign that Lenin's ideas could be understood in \nways diametrically opposite to those which he really held (and that \nthis was not a phenomenon peculiar to the years after his death); it \nalso shows that the Bolsheviks were not devoid of theorists such as \nFinn-Enotaevski who already perceived that rural life was more \ncomplex than as portrayed by the Lenin of the 1890s. \nSuch realism among Bolsheviks came to the fore only after 1921, \nwhen an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt pushed Lenin into introducing \na New Economic Policy granting large economic and social \nconcessions to the peasantry. \nIn the years immediately before 1917, Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique. Karl Kautsky's works were read assiduous-\nly; and Lenin admired his attacks on Eduard David, who argued \nagainst Marx's assumption that large-scale capitalist agricultural \nestates might not turn out to be as competitive on the world market \nas small, owner-occupied farms.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. 93 Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.97 Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry.98 The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. It seems a significant lapse for a writer with the special \nbias towards the 'proletariat' that being a Marxist involves. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state. This, in Lenin's \n All or Nothing \n17 \npresentation, was a form of 'Bonapartism'.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. 107 Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. 111 At its core were Lenin's speculations on the reasons why \nthe Kadets, as the leading liberal party, acquired so few seats. The newly ultra-right political complexion of the \nparliamentary chamber, according to Lenin, was the product of the \ncalculations and manipulations of the authorities. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. 114 \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n1911, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad. 117 \n All or Nothing \n19 \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. Ordzhonikidze blatantly \naspired to the arrangement of a Bolshevik-dominated Conference; he \ninvited a few Party Mensheviks (who were close to Plekhanov and \nopposed Martov's gentleness with the so-called Liquidators), but \nonly with the purpose of giving the impression that the Conference \nwas more open to the party as a whole than it really would be. He and his friends \ndiscerned that Lenin aimed to reconstruct a Central Committee \nunder his personal control and, by means of the Conference, claim \nthat it presided over the entire party. 120 \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. Two \nrepresentatives from Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks turned up and \nstayed, and Ordzhonikidze was used by Lenin as his 'expert' in \nhandling them at the Conference. No other faction except the \nBolsheviks and the Party Mensheviks was present. 121 For most \npurposes, the Prague Conference, which the Bolsheviks dubbed the \nSixth Party Conference, was a Bolshevik Factional Conference. 122 \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. Worse \nstill, from Lenin's viewpoint, was the fact that six delegates had come \nunder the assumption that other factions were being invited. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists. 123 Ordzhoni-\nkidze informed fellow delegates that Lenin might walk out if the \nrecipients of these late invitations turned up. 124 Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 128 \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n21 \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. 132 Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 133 Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable. 142 Ordzhonikidze took offence, especially at Lenin's \ninsinuation that the anti-emigre noises were merely tearful laments. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. 146 Lenin \nstressed that such organisations need not be tightly-structured. 147 Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. 148 \nGoloshchekin concurred with the Menshevik speaker, adding that \nLenin had painted an 'idealistic picture'. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. \nLenin advised the replacement of a clause which embodied outright \nopposition to the elective principle in party work; his grounds were \nnot philosophical but those of political tact. 154 Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 155 In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. 156 Lenin also successfully urged \nthe Conference to insist that the party's deputies in the State Duma \nshould denounce the Kadets more vigorously and should accentuate \nthe slogans of a democratic republic, the eight-hour day, and \nconfiscation of gentry-owned land. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. 160 \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. 162 The seven elected members of the Central \nCommittee, moreover, were not as solidly pro-Lenin as is usually \nthought. 163 Secondly, many of the \n'Leninists' had criticised the emigres at the Conference; and they \nincluded newly-elected members of the Central Committee Ordzho-\nnikidze, Spandaryan and Goloshchekin. 164 \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech. 167 Seven months had passed since the Bolshevik \nventure in Prague. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. 172 Disagreements \nbetween Lenin and Leo Jogiches, the Polish social-democratic leader, \nwere of long standing. At the Second Party Congress, in 1903, Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg, instructing their \nrepresentatives at the Congress by letter, argued that Polish \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindependence was an irrelevance in a capitalist world which was \nmaking economic nonsense of all frontiers. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. Subsequently, in a \nCentral Committee of twelve persons, the Poles Warski and F. At the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart \nin 1907 Luxemburg, Martov and Lenin collaborated closely. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. And it \nannoyed Lenin, but not to the point of rupture; indeed he came, in \n1917, to see the uses of deploying a programmatic slogan very similar \nto that of Jogiches. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. 183 Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. 184 Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. 185 \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. In his own organisation, Jogiches was as author-\nitarian and intolerant as Lenin and he entirely lacked the Bolshevik \nleader's more attractive personal qualities. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. 189 \nBut the Warsaw organisation saw Lenin as a protector of their \ninterests, and Lenin received news that a complaint had been made \nby it against Jogiches's decision to boycott the Prague Conference. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. \nSince neither the Jewish Bund nor the Social-Democracy of the \nLatvian Region had agreed to join Lenin's venture in Prague (and \nLenin had not given them an invitation in any event. 199 \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'. Those Poles who stayed as his allies were destined to play a \nrole alongside Lenin in the realignment of forces within the European \nsocialist left in the First World War. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-1914. Many of the Poles were critics of the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, and Lenin did not abrogate his loyalty to \nKautsky until then. 201 But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in 1914; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in 1915-16,202 and, in 1917, \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.204 Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. The extraordinary feature of Lenin's treatment was its \nnear-metaphysical lack of doubt in Marx and Engels; no prominent \nMarxist gave so overtly unquestioning a commitment. \nLenin fought for Marx as his 'teacher', but chose carefully where \nto make a stand.209 Lenin held back from \nthe fray.210 \nBut a thinker's quality is revealed as much by his silences as by his \nstatements; and Lenin's failure to address the pertinent questions \nraised by Michels and Weber damages his reputation as a political \ntheorist even for his own epoch. \nHis efforts on Marx's behalf in the last few years before the First \nWorld War were mainly in the field of economics.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.212 But the comment presumably seemed \nto Lenin, on reflection, too much like a retreat; and he added that \nGerman wages were not rising in real value and that inflation was \nsoaring more steeply.13 This could have constituted a return to the \nfirst version of Marx's immiseration theory; but Lenin refrained from \nproposing the trend as a general norm. \nMarx exhilarated him, and those studies of Lenin which entirely \ndeny his Marxist commitment are profoundly erroneous.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era.215 Lenin did not foresee the mass purchases of electrical \ngoods under capitalism. \nLenin's reaction to Taylor's 'scientific management' was negative \n(and it was only after the Bolsheviks had seized power in the October \nRevolution that he started to perceive Taylorism's advantages). Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. In photographs, Lenin was \nalways neatly dressed. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. For most of his career before the February Revolution of \n1917, Lenin had to live in rented rooms, and fairly cheap rented \nrooms at that. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. The young Bolshevik, V. Karpinski \n All or Nothing \n33 \nwas among these and, in later years, gratefully recalled how Lenin \nalways insisted upon paying him at the going rate. Karpinski knew \nthat Lenin, as an economist, divided the Russian peasantry into poor \npeasants, middle peasants and kulaks. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money.219 Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. He justifiably thought of himself as a leading Marxist \npolitical writer. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Lenin_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.3 Lenin concluded: 'All hopes of a peaceful development of the \nRussian revolution have disappeared definitively.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. The Central Committee met on \n13-li:,July, in the absence of Lenin and Zinoviev (as well as the \nimprisoned Kamenev), 5 to consider strategy. Representatives of the \nparty's localleaderships of Moscow and Petrograd as well as Central \nBureau of the Military Organisation also attended. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.', according to Ordzhoni-\nkidze's later account, Lenin let it be known that the factory-\nworkshop c9mmittees could provide the institutional base for the \nforthcoming socialist administration.6 Even the April Party Confer-\nence had given no absolute commitment to rule by soviets;7 and in \nThe State and Revolution, written in the months after the July Days, \nLenin had barely mentioned the soviets. Only Sverdlov fully accepted Lenin's view-\npoint immediately after the July Days.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. In addition, the party had \ninvested its energies in persuading workers that 'soviet power' was \nthe noblest objective; and the practical difficulties of justifying \nLenin's proposed change of slogans, when Bolshevik activists spoke \nat open mass meetings, would be considerable. The Central \nCommittee meeting rejected Lenin's invocation by ten votes out of \nfifteen. 10 \nLenin wrote a short article, 'On Slogans', in reply and condemned \nthe Central Committee for what he saw as a lack of tactical \nflexibility.\" 'On Slogans' was published by the Kronstadt \nBolsheviks, and reached a number of activists in the provinces. 12 \nLenin's efforts did not go unrewarded; and a shift towards his stance \nhad in any case been occurring in the Central Committee even before \n The Fire Next Time \n203 \n'On Slogans' became widely known. Stalin concurred with Lenin \nthat Kerenski had presided over 'the triumph of the counter-\nrevolution'.14 Yet he affirmed that the ultimate objective remained the same: \nnamely to establish a socialist administration of soviets. 16 \nYet Lenin's fortunes were not as bad as they seemed. Perhaps this clarifica-\ntion (or modification, if Ordzhonikidze's statement in his memoirs \nabout the factory-workshop committees is to be believed)18 nudged \nStalin and the Central Committee majority towards accepting that \nLenin's hostility to the 'All Power to the Soviets. Lenin's Bolshevik critics may also \nhave been reassured to note that he acknowledged that an immediate \ninsurrection was impracticable.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets.20 Lenin and Zinoviev could not risk the journey; \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Trotski, Lunacharski and Kamenev were in prison.21 \nThe decree was not unwelcome to Lenin inasmuch as it dissuaded \nBolshevik critics from continuing to demand that he should deliver \nhimself up to the authorities.23 There is a strong \npossibility that the Central Committee's motion on the political \nsituation, as presented to the Congress by Stalin, was based on a \ndraft handed over by Lenin.24 Lenin's physical absence did not \npreclude his political semi-presence. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. A troika of leaders guided \nthe debates at the Congress: Sverdlov, Stalin and Bukharin. His \nmain aim was to show that the Bolshevik leadership had not \nprovoked the clashes on the streets of the capital in early July. He looked forward also to socialist revolution \nin the West. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. In such a \ncontingency, according to Bukharin, the Bolsheviks would have to \nfight a defensive revolutionary war against the Germans.34 Lenin, while sharing Osinski's concern intellectually, \nwould surely have approved of Bukharin's tactful reticence. He mentioned that 'certain comrades' still believed \ni~ to be 'utopian to raise the ,question of socialist revolution' in \nRussia. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. Whereas Lenin had held forth about the era of \nimperialism and the imminence of European socialist revolution, \nStalin addressed the specificity of Russia. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed.

A \nsocialist admini . '52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential.61 Here \nLenin would probably have sympathised with Preobrazhenski's basic \npoint. Stalin's later advocacy of 'socialism in one country' was being \nbroached in a sketchy manner even before the October Revolution. All \nthese four were in hiding or in prison: Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and \nTrotski. Trotski, who had only recently become a \nBolshevik, now joined the central party leadership. The Bolshevik right, which had been strongly represented in \nthe central party body after the Seventh Conference in April, had lost \nground. As Lenin put his thoughts in order for a seizure \nof power and for a programme of social and economic reforms, he \ncould look to a more receptive set of colleagues than he had \npossessed since entering the politics of Russian Marxism. \nKERENSKI AND KORNILOV \nDespite the dispute over slogans, no Bolshevik at the Congress gave \nthe impression of expecting to take power in the immediate future. If \nLenin had been there, things might have been different. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. For Lenin, this proved conclusively that \nthe Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were collaborating \nwith the forces of counter-revolution.64 Kerenski's policies, even \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthough Lenin exaggerated, undoubtedly moved rightwards.66 \nKerenski, as Lenin continually asserted, relied on military support \nto reimpose the cabinet's will in Petrograd. The sole major omission from the list of \nparticipants was the Bolshevik party.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. A counter-\nrevolutionary mutiny had restored them to free activity in the \ncapital; the sole major Bolshevik who could not afford to appear \nin the open was Lenin.70 \nLenin, analysing the events as reported in the press, swung between \ninterpretations. Accordingly, Kerenski badly \n11eeded to mend his fences with the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries in the soviets. The rising influence of the Mensheviks and \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries induced even Lenin to raise, on 1 \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSeptember, the question of whether a peaceful development of the \nrevolution was possible. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 73 \nLenin noted that peaceful revolutions, while being rare, were not \ninconceivable. 74 \nIt was an intriguing phase in Lenin's career. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. By 12 September \nhe was writing 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power' and demanded an \nimmediate uprising; and, on 14 September, he repeated this call in \n'Marxism and Insurrection';77 both documents were letters addressed \nto the Central Committee. Thus the 'peaceful \ndevelopment' of the revolution sketched by Lenin would have started \nonly after a violent phase had been endured. His \nfirst justification was that both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets \nhad acquired Bolshevik working majorities earlier in the month.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.82 Kamenev and Trotski, who had both been released \nfrom prison, were nominated as Bolshevik spokesmen and required \nto demand the removal of Kerenski and the installation of a \ngovernment composed entirely of socialists.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Trotski, too, was \nmoving towards such a standpoint and earned a plaudit from Lenin \nfor the taunts he flung at the non-Bolshevik socialists at the \nDemocratic Conference: 'Bravo, comrade Trotski.'84 But even \nTrotski believed that insurrection could not immediately be under-\ntaken, and the Central Committee as a whole resisted Lenin's \nproposal. It \nwas as if Lenin had been the boss of a gang intent on robbing a bank \nwho had incautiously confided his intentions to paper - his fellow \ngang-members wished to destroy the incriminating evidence.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise. 86 Thus the Central Committee deftly used the prestige \nand authority of 'Lenin' to oppose Lenin. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Through the first weeks of October there was a series of \nvictories for the Bolsheviks in elections to the various mass \norganisations. Lenin's affirmation that 'the \nmajority of the people' favoured the Bolsheviks lacked cogency. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. \nLenin's insistence that time was not on the side of the Bolshevik \nparty is therefore hard to explain. \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin suggested that a further Kornilovite coup attempt could be in \nthe offing; he also maintained that Kerenski would deliberately hand \nthe country over to the Germans. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. \n'THE STATE AND REVOLUTION' \nLenin's hardheaded campaign for what he saw as his party's interests \nwas one aspect of a multifaceted political personality. He was also a \ntheorist, and wanted to put down a general statement on the nature \nof socialist revolution. The State and \nRevolution was the most refined embodiment of Lenin's strategy for \nthe carrying through of a socialist transformation in modern \nindustrial societies. The contents \namounted to a co-ordination and explication of the textual data \ncollected in the notes on Marxism and the state taken before the \nFebruary Revolution. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917.97 Lenin had always intended to present himself \nas a mere re-teller of the original Marxian story, and the absence of \nthe projected last chapter reinforced the work's exegetical character. As Lenin pointed out, Marxism's co-founders \nbelieved that every society since the ending of ancient communism \nhad been divided into rival classes.98 \nLenin's second chapter discussed the viewpoint of Marx and \nEngels on the revolutionary upsurge across Europe in 1848-51.99 Lenin tossed these citations in the face of Karl Kautsky. Lenin retailed the characteristics approved by Marx. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. \nInstead, he wanted a 'working corporation', and Lenin perceived this \nfundamentally as a plea for mass participation in public life. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. 106 By \nany standard this was hyper-confidence; the return to Russia in 1917 \nhad reinforced his sanguine earlier hopes as articulated in 'Marxism \non the State'. Lenin noted the Anti-Diihring's notion that the state \nwould eventually 'wither away'. Lenin reproduced the arguments of Marx and Engels \nin the 1870s against contemporary anarchists. The ultimate Marxist \nobjective was a state-free society; but Lenin maintained that the \ntransition from capitalism to communism required an intermediate \nstage of socialism which would be inaugurated by the formation of a \nsocialist state: the dictatorship of the proletariat. 108 Marx's attacks \non anarchism had led Karl Kautsky and others to treat the state as a \npermanent feature of human society. 110 \nAs a Marxist, Lenin wanted to examine 'the economic founda-\ntions' for this withering away. \nLenin's allegations of financial corruption and political manipulative-\nness were cogent; and an ampler indication of the collusion between \ngovernmental ministers, industrial magnates and press barons would \nhave bolstered his case considerably. But Lenin was writing for \nMarxists, who needed no persuasion on such issues. 113 \nIn the sixth chapter Lenin turned to the reasons why, in his view, \nMarxian ideas on state and revolution had previously been misunder-\nstood by Marxists. \nReviewing the controversies between Karl Kautsky and Eduard \nBernstein in the 1890s, Lenin pointed out that Kautsky had \nexpressly refused to engage in debate about 'the problem of the \nproletarian dictatorship'. 114 According to Lenin, Kautsky had \nP. This \nnaturally raised the question of why Lenin had not criticised such \nalleged neglect before 1914. Lenin replied that Kautsky had at least \nadhered to basic Marxist standpoints until 1914, particularly the idea \nthat 'the revolutionary era was beginning' (which appeared in The \nPath To Power in 1909).115 On the other hand, Lenin recognised that \nAnton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Radek had convinc-\n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \ningly exposed Kautsky's 'passive radicalism' before the war. For Lenin, this had come to demonstrate \nKautsky's lack of understanding that a socialist political order would \nbe based on the model of the Paris Commune and would dispense \naltogether with the need for a 'bureaucracy'. It also made Lenin's State and Revolution seem more \noriginal than it was. Bukharin's name was not mentioned even \nthough his wartime reconsiderations of Marxism had been influen-\ntial in leading Lenin to the basis of his new contentions.'2\u00b0 Non-Bolsheviks felt no such \ninhibition. Kautsky and Martov attacked the book robustly; their \nremarks were all the more interesting inasmuch as both were \nMarxists and shared many of Lenin's intellectual premises.124 \nMartov's examination of such texts matched Lenin in exegetical \nskill. Martov delighted in exposing Lenin's sleights of hand. A \ncrucial example was Lenin's suggestion that Engels had endorsed a \ndemocratic republic as an objective solely on the grounds that it \nprovided 'the shortest way which leads to the dictatorship of the \nproletariat'. 126 Martov and Kautsky had proved that \nLenin's interpretation of Marx was not watertight. 130 Both felt that Lenin's raucous claims to \n'orthodoxy' were therefore illegitimate. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. Indeed, Lenin saw himself as offering a vision \nof a totally harmonious and self-regulating society which was \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrealisable within a not too lengthy period; and he anticipated a more \nor less easy, trouble-free socialist revolution. 133 \nHis non-Bolshevik critics, however, did not limit themselves to \nMarxology. Kautsky drew attention to the large proportion of the \npopulation even in an advanced capitalist country such as Germany \nwhich would lose civic rights under the dispensation of Lenin's \nrecommendations; he questioned whether the level of repression \ncould ever be as low, under such circumstances, as Lenin \nclaimed. Starting from Lenin's \nassumption that the proletariat would constitute the immense \nmajority in a society undergoing a socialist revolution, he asked \nwhat there would be to fear from allowing the supposedly tiny \nmiddle-class minority to continue to vote (especially if Lenin was \nsincere in saying that such a revolution was inconceivable unless \nmass popular support already existed). Moreover, Lenin's \ntwo antagonists did not share the unargued premise of his book that \neach class would gravitate permanently towards support for a single \nparty. The State and Revolution did not mention parties at all; and \nKautsky and Martov were introducing data from 1918, when a one-\nparty state became an enduring phenomenon in Russia. 139 \nLenin very probably had no conscious intention that a socialist \ndictatorship should undertake a large-scale and bloody repression; \nbut this only serves to demonstrate the facile quality of his thinking: \nthe objective likelihood of such a dictatorship having to turn to \nterrorist methods in order to sustain its power was strong. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Lenin failed, for \nexample, to explain how the local soviets would interact with central \nsoviet organs after the revolution. 141 This is not to claim that Western parliamentary \ndemocracies always embody a just and efficient system of rule in \nevery way; but the point at issue is that Lenin's alternative does not \nseem inherently more just or more efficient even from a theoretical \nstandpoint. Literate ordinary \nworkers, Lenin maintained, could take over these tasks with ease. \nIt is not sensible to assume, as Lenin did, that administrators can \nbe prevented from forming themselves into a corporate group (or \ninto groups) simply by insisting on electivity, on the right of instant \nrecall and on payment at a worker's rate. Kautsky put it in a nutshell when he retortc;d to Lenin that \nclasses can rule but cannot govern; and that mass participatory \nqemocracy is utopian. Yet what \nwas the relationship between such theory and subsequent Russian \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhistory. Many have argued that Lenin's book was a calculated \ndeception inasmuch as he had no intention of trying to establish \nmass participatory democracy: he was not so huge a hypocrite. \nSeveral political leaders who knew him intimately, including Yuli \nMartov, implied that the first person he deceived was Vladimir Ilich \nUlyanov-Lenin. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Lenin dreamed about locally-based mass \nself-emancipation while also anticipating a future socialist economy \nwhich would be 'organised like a postal service', such as he had \nwitnessed in Switzerland. Lenin's offering was a strange \nconcoction. Russia was not the exclusive \nfocus; and, when he started taking notes on socialist revolution in \nJanuary 1917, Lenin must have had Germany more firmly in mind \nthan his native land. Lenin did not specifically \nstate that his book was intended as a blueprint for the immediate \nfuture of Russian politics (even though many scholars have treated it \nsimply as such). All therefore knew of Lenin's \nintentions with the utmost clarity. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 153 But there was \nno fixed terminological pattern, and Lenin sometimes reverted to the \nformulas he had evolved in the spring. 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. The second \npoint is that Lenin apparently made only eight explicit references to \ndictatorship from the start of September through to 25 October159 -\nnot a enormous number in view of the topic's importance. \nIn addition, all those references occurred in the carefully-composed \nprose of Bolshevik newspaper articles and pamphlets. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Yet the result was that the great mass of workers and \npeasants outside the Bolshevik party can scarcely have known about \nhis full range of plans. This can hardly have been fortuitous; Lenin \ncannot have wanted to upset popular sensibilities unnecessarily, and \nthe virtues of dictatorship would not automatically have commended \nthemselves to the Russian working class. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. 163 And Lenin himself, on the few occasions \nwhen he advocated socialist dictatorship, framed his arguments very \ncarefully. 165 \nOn the other hand, notions about dictatorship undoubtedly held \nLenin within a powerful magnetic field even though he mentioned \nthem comparatively rarely. And so, whereas the general population - probably \nincluding most rank-and-file Bolsheviks- was unaware of his fiercer \nintentions, careful and regular readers should have picked up the \nmessage. 166 \nLenin, indeed, did not stop short of anticipating the use of 'terror' \nin Russia. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Lenin wanted the \nlaw changed so that 'the exploiters (i.' Strictly speaking, Lenin's plan for \ndifferential legislation on capital punishment did not involve \narbitrary violence; he wanted capitalists executed for specific \noffences, not just because they were capitalists. For most of the year, however, he preferred to avoid the \ntopic altogether or to concentrate on what he described as the terror \nbeing perpetrated against the Bolsheviks by the Provisional Govern-\nment. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. \nNor was Lenin's willingness to ignore the formally-registered will \nof the majority confined to his ideas about the Assembly: he was no \nmore solicitous as regards the mass organisations. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. \nNATIONALITY PROJECTS \nLenin beat the drum about the struggle for political revolution, \nsummoning workers, peasants and soldiers to overthrow the Provi-\nsional Government; but the rhythms of the national question were \nnot forgotten by him. The Provisional Government \nand its Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary supporters were \nfearful lest the Bolsheviks should take advantage of its difficulties \n The Fire Next Time \n229 \nwith some of the non-Russian nationalities. Such conflict \nwas grist in Lenin's mill, and after the Seventh Bolshevik Party \nConference he continued to demand that all nations in the old \nRussian empire should be accorded the right of secession. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. 189 \nMark Liber, the prominent Bundist, had repeated Semkovski's \narguments in his report on behalf of the Mensheviks, the Socialist \nRevolutionaries and the Bund at the First Congress of Soviets; 190 but \nLenin treated both Liber and Semkovski with silent contempt \nthroughout the year. But \naccount should also be taken that, in terms of ideas, Lenin's \nproposed solution of the national question within a unitary state \nhad much in common with Semkovski's. 192 The crucial \ndifference was that Lenin entirely refused to consider Semkovski's \narguments on ethnic intermingling (and it was only after the October \nRevolution that he began to face up to the problem). 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. 196 \nAnd yet we should be wary of assuming that even Lenin made \nnational self-determination into a prominently visible plank in his \nplatform. Leading Bolsheviks privately asked him to \nclarify his policy; but he argued that it was more advisable to limit \nthe party's pronouncements to a simple 'declaration of principles' \n(and even then he published this prevaricatory remark not in a mass-\ncirculation newspaper or at an open mass meeting but in the low-\ncirculation 'thick journal' Enlightenment, which was read mainly by \nBolshevik intellectuals).201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917.202 \nLenin probably considered the matter as being less immediately \ncritical than he had earlier imagined. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. Lenin \ndid precisely that. All Bolsheviks saw that the \neconomy's rapid deterioration was a crucial issue in the struggle \namong the political parties, and Lenin was his party's major \neconomic spokesman. He got down to elaborating his ideas from \nearly summer 1917. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint.206 Lenin railed against \nthe greed and selfishness of businessmen. \nLenin even asserted that the economic crisis was quickly soluble. His \n The Fire Next Time \n233 \nwritings contrasted with those of Bolshevik economists such as V. 208 Lenin retorted that the \ncountry abounded in food, coal, oil and metal and confronted fewer \nobjective difficulties than did Germany. \nThe panacea, in Lenin's judgement, was to release the capacities of \n'the people'.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans. Lenin urged the idea's dissemination and implementa-\ntion across the country and throughout all major industrial \nsyndicates and banking institutions.214 Lenin's intention was for \nwage-earners to supervise owners and managers. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin. 218 \nThis concorded with his more optimistic views on the extent of global \ncapitalist development already achieved and on the speed which \ncould characterise the inception of socialism in Russia as well as in \nEurope in general.219 \nLenin was more cautious. 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. Lenin seldom forgot his \nduties as chief of a political party. 224 \n The Fire Next Time \n235 \nOther proposals put forward by Lenin included progressive \ntaxation on incomes and property; compulsory publication of \nshareholdings of over 5000 roubles; universal labour duty, which \nwould mean that those who did not work would not eat either. Lenin may have been cautious by Bukharin's \nstandards, if not by Milyutin's, and even stood towards the right of \nBolshevik economic thought in 1917; but he still occupied a spot on \nthe extreme left of the spectrum of Russian economic proposals \noutside his party. Ilin' (Lenin's pseudonym as author of The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia in 1899) had focused on the \nintimate relationship between the respective advances of agriculture \nand industry. \nFurthermore, there was no originality in Lenin's points about \ndemilitarisation. 231 \nAs regards the land question, Lenin for months added little to \nwhat he had said at the Seventh Party Conference in April. There he had repeated his argument \nthat a simple transfer of the land into the hands of the peasantry as a \nwhole would not help the village poor, who lacked the equipment, \n 236 \nLenin: A Political L((e \nlivestock and finances to farm independently: he was continuing to \nappeal mainly to the poorest section of the peasantry.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy.234 Even Lenin, at the Congress of Peasants' Deputies in \nJune, avoided mentioning nationalisation explicitly; he was turning \nto more ambiguous formulas than before, urging that the land \nbecome 'the property of the whole people'. Not enough is known about the \ndebates behind closed doors to allow us to say why Lenin altered his \nstance; but probably either the Central Committee forced him or he \nindependently took cognisance that nationalisation would not prove \nattractive to the peasants. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. Two hundred and forty-two 'peasant instructions' had \nbeen collated, and Lenin urged that the party accept them as the \nbasis of the Bolshevik party's policy.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers.240 Lenin's change of policy meant \nthat he was taking up the Socialist-Revolutionary agrarian pro-\ngramme.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation.245 \nLenin enjoyed the discomfiture of his opponents, and was not at all \ndisconcerted by the accusation that he had stolen another party's \npolicy. He wanted power for himself and his party, and he wanted \nthis power to be directed at the eventual attainment of socialism in \nRussia and Europe. But he \nwas a revolutionary. \nThis was an engaging and even endearing characteristic; but it also \nshowed a casualness and, for a theoretician who had castigated all \nand sundry for their weaknesses of analysis and anticipation, an \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhypocrisy and irresponsibility. Lenin's self-awareness was not great. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader. The scent of real power grew stronger, and \nLenin's excitement at his opportunity intensified.", "Lenin_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. Unease and irritation were expressed in \ndozens of written queries passed up to Lenin at the Tenth Party \nCongress.2 Well as he had managed the \nCongress, Lenin had also had much luck. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. Connoisseurs of his style were able to recall that in 1918, despite \nhaving being the protagonist of a separate peace treaty with Germany \nand Austria-Hungary, he insisted that others in the Bolshevik party \nleadership should go out to Brest-Litovsk to do the signing. Certainly \nhe could plead pre-occupation with other business which was being \nreported to him: the Anglo-Soviet negotiations; the Kronstadt and \nTambov revolts; the attempted seizure of power in Berlin by the \nGerman Communist Party with their 'March Action'; the worsening \nconflicts in the Soviet trade union leadership; industrial strikes in \nSoviet Russia; dissent in the Bolshevik party; the activities of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries; the establishment of 'Soviet \npower' in the Transcaucasus. 5 \nLenin was in the chair. 10 Lenin was staying \nout of the highlight. 13 \nThus the potential region of greatest grain surplus in the Soviet-ruled \nrepublics was to be exempted from Lenin's reform. The antagonism of \nthe Ukraine-based Bolshevik leadership, already expressed at the Tenth \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nParty Congress, may have had an influence; 14 but probably Kamenev \nand his colleagues- with Lenin in agreement in the background- were \nthemselves worried about a resurgence of Ukrainian private trade \nbefore the completion of the transfer of land from gentry and rich \npeasants. \nBolshevik leaders before and during the Party Congress had considered \nideas on reform limited to bartering between the peasant producer and \nboth the state procurer and the individual consumer; private traders \nhad not been envisaged.t 8 \nStill Lenin kept his head down.20 Lenin, a more than willing public speaker in normal times, \ndelivered only four speeches in the ten weeks after the Party Congress. Lenin was lying low. There was conflict between the People's Commissariat of \nFood Supplies and the Central Statistical Administration in the \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n189 \nestimation of the grainstocks available; and Lenin, with his expertise in \nthe geography of agriculture going back to his 1899 book The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia, was naturally drawn into \narbitrating. Antonov-Ovseenko, sent by the \nPolitburo as political commissar to suppress the Tambov peasant \nrevolt, wrote to Lenin in alarm at the quota assigned to the local \nauthorities.27 The reform was \ntherefore still a tremendous gamble by Lenin; it might cause more \nproblems than it solved. Lenin, in the sole speech to the Moscow party \nsecretaries, reported his own astonishment at a report he had received \nfrom comrade Korolev which revealed that, in Ivanovo-Voznesensk \nprovince, 'no more than six factories have been working and not one of \nthese work continuously for a whole month'. \nCONQUEST OF EMPIRE \nAt the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently Lenin had demanded a \nunion between workers and peasants.30 He \ncould not say this at the Congress without casting a shadow on the \nparty's claim to be defending the interests of the mass of the \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \npopulation. Gentle towards the peasants he met, Lenin was brutal in his \ndispensations of policy.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved.33 The ruthlessness anticipated by Lenin at the Tenth \nParty Congress was repeatedly requested.35 Propa-\nganda would, Lenin hoped, eventually redress the discredit into which \nthe Bolshevik regime had fallen. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin.40 Lenin wished to form a \nfederation of Russia, Ukraine and other republics whereas Stalin \nwanted to incorporate these other republics in the RSFSR with rights \nof 'autonomy' of the type inaugurated with the Bashkir Republic in \n1919. To treat Ukraine in such a way, according \nto Lenin was 'chauvinism'.41 Russia and its Bolshevik leaders had to go \nout of their way to demonstrate their anti-nationalist credentials; and \nhe was annoyed that his nearest major ally in the party on these \nquestions had turned against him. Perhaps Stalin, unlike Lenin, was \nalso aiming to have as strong and large an RSFSR as possible so as to \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nact as a counterweight to a future Soviet Germany; but Lenin the \nRussian was less Russocentric than Stalin the Georgian, and he was \napparently untroubled about a Soviet federation in Central and \nEastern Europe which might not be dominated by Russia.43 In previous \ndebates on the 'national question', moreover, Lenin had met intense \nopposition from the party on the grounds that he excessively indulged \nnationalist opinion.45 Lenin could not count on defeating Stalin's \nconstitutional project in open party debate. A tacit understanding therefore \nemerged between Lenin and Stalin that other more pressing matters of \npolitics and economy should engage their attention: the fractiousness \nof the 'trade union controversy' was considered an ill-affordable \nluxury. \nNot that the affairs of the non-Russian nationalities were overlooked \nby Lenin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. On 14 April 1921 he sent an open letter to 'the \ncommunist comrades of Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan \nand the Mountain Republic' demanding that local conditions be \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n193 \nrespected. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. \nLenin backed it in principle, yet deemed implementation premature. Even Lenin envisaged that the discussions would \nlast no longer than 'several weeks' (and he was persuaded by Stalin that \nthis could safely be re-phrased as 'a certain period of time'). \nMyasnikyan, who had a leading role in the Armenian Bolshevik \nleadership, to appear at the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in \nDecember 1921 to demand the Transcaucasian Federation's creation. 53 \nStill there was no deliberation as to the permanent arrangements to \nbe made among the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and the proposed \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTranscaucasian Federation. Stalin wrote to Lenin on 13 January 1922 \nrepeating his commitment to the incorporation of all of them within \nthe RSFSR. It was certain \nunnamed comrades, according to Stalin, who demanded immediate \naction. Possibly he \nwas content to see the Transcaucasian Federation, which was \npromulgated despite Georgian Bolshevik resistance on 12 March, \ncome into existence before moving on to a grander constitutional \nproject. 56 On 11 March 1922 the Ukrainian Politburo complained \nto the Central Committee in Moscow about a series of infringements of \nthe republic's rights as embodied in the treaty with the RSFSR.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party.59 \nSooner or later, however, Stalin and Lenin would clash over Stalin's \nproject for 'autonomisation'. He \npromoted non-Russian Bolsheviks to high office.60 Furthermore, his duties as \nPeople's Commissar for Nationality Affairs left him in no doubt how \nfrail the Bolshevik party was in the non-Russian republics.61 The arguments for letting republican Bolshevik \norganisations take full charge of their respective republics were not self-\nevident. To Stalin it must have seemed that Lenin had not thought out \na responsible party policy. Lenin had been proved wrong before in \nStalin's eyes. Stalin was therefore unprepared for \nthe intensity of Lenin's hostility when it revealed itself from autumn \n1922. \nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS \nBoth Lenin and Stalin at any rate knew that the 'national question' was \ninseparably linked to issues of foreign policy. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism.6s About the French, who were owed vast sums of \nmoney since before the October Revolution, Lenin harboured no \nillusions.67 \nLenin also knew that nothing could be counted upon in advance.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921.70 \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n197 \nThis emphasis was strengthened by the failure of the 'March Action' \nundertaken by the German Communist Party, on the initiative of Bela \nKun and other representatives of the Communist International, to \noverthrow the elected German government and seize power in the last \nweek of March 1921.72 At the time \nLenin did not comment. Lenin's diary in \nMarch was filled with considerations about the tax in kind, the \nGeorgian operation, the Kronstadt and Tambov revolts, the arrange-\nment of foreign concessions, the trade treaties, the Tenth Party \nCongress. \nThe episode shows how even Lenin did not control his colleagues \nover all policies. Equally Lenin's political distance from the March Action \ndemonstrates the intensity of his pre-occupation with the multifaceted \ncrisis confronting the Soviet state. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession.' The opposition, according to Lenin, \nwas supposedly motivated by 'Donbass patriotism'. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. On 10 \nOctober 1921 Lenin wrote to Trotski approvingly about the \nnegotiations in progress with the German high command. Nevertheless Lenin was often \nknown to play two games at once. \nLenin unusually kept aloof from the debate among his colleagues.80 His proposals for Baku, Grozny, \nDon bass and Kamchatka were contentious, and he may have judged it \nunnecessary to cause further dispute by raising doubts about the \nimminence of socialist revolutions in Europe. Lenin's favourite \nassertion that the Bolshevik party should focus on practical tasks and \nshould give up its chattering carried the implication that theorising \nshould be kept in the background.81 Yet Lenin \nfrequently tried to have his cake and eat it too. Lenin \npreferred to get on with government and to leave speculation to others. For example, Lenin's main speech at the Ninth \nCongress of Soviets on 23 December was magisterially unconnected \nwith the Trotski-Zinoviev debate. On international relations, Lenin \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspoke in the most general terms to the difficulties of the labour \nmovement abroad; but, although he talked about the inception of a \ncrisis in world capitalism, he used vague language and implied no \ncriticism of Trotski.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition.88 Even then, Lenin is recorded as having mentioned co-\nexistence without breathing anything about its being peaceful. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Lenin himself put \ninverted commas around 'co-habitation', thereby signalling his \nrecognition that an eventual violent clash between socialism and \ncapitalism was probable. Toning down \nTrotski's presentation, Lenin at the Ninth Congress of Soviets \ncharacterised capitalism with the followint words: 'What has been \nachieved is a certain fragile equilibrium'. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen.92 \nTo Lenin's mind, trade links should be restored only if the gains of \nthe October Revolution and the Civil War were not damaged. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement.'93 This confidence that Bolshevism \ncould survive was to be treated by Stalin after Lenin's death as proof \nthat Lenin had believed that the building of socialism could be \ncompleted even in conditions of capitalist encirclement. No such \nthought crossed Lenin's mind or left his lips even though he \nincreasingly behaved as if 'European socialist revolution' was not \nimmediately in prospect. Lenin had been discussing only the regime's \nsurvival rather than the implementation of all the tasks described \nbefore October 1917 in The State and Revolution. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore.95 \n'ON THE FOOD TAX ' \nLenin sought to clarify the New Economic Policy with a pamphlet. In elucidating his own \nintentions, Lenin had to work hard to keep fellow Bolsheviks on his \nside. \nIt was partly for this reason that, when calling for the discontinua-\ntion of earlier measures, Lenin chose to accentuate aspects of \n 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontinuity. Lenin claimed that the dangers \nwere avoidable. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. Lenin repeated that the agreeing of \n'concessions' with foreign entrepreneurs would make an important \ncontribution to the resources of the Soviet state. But Lenin's \nwords involved, too, a deal of obfuscation. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. In \nLenin's presentation, the end to grain requisitioning would eventually \nfacilitate the inauguration of 'correct socialist product-exchange'. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. The principal obstacle, according to Lenin, was the \nweakness of the Soviet state's technical resources, especially in \nelectricity power-stations. 104 \nLenin still wrote as a confident social engineer.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. 'It is impossible to distinguish speculation from \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \n\"correct\" trade,' Lenin added, ' if speculation is to be understood in the \npolitico-economic sense. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. 110 \nTurning to peacetime tasks, Lenin declared that 'bureaucratism' \naffected all corners of the state's activities. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'. But his remedy \nwas hopelessly inadequate; and, in recommending it, Lenin showed \nhimself to be out of touch with those many Bolshevik leaders who by \nnow enjoyed and wanted to prolong their life of privilege and power in \nthe capital. Bolsheviks had to buckle down to \ntheir own education: 'We must not be scared to admit that here there is \nstill much that can and must be learned from the capitalist.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. Progress might be impeded, and it remained \nLenin's contention that it would take decades before socialism could be \nattained in Russia. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. The \nBolsheviks were few, but they were united: 'And we know what we \nwant.' 119 \nTHE TENTH PARTY CONFERENCE \nAnd so Lenin began to resemble a door-to-door salesman who, having \nsold an article to his customers one day, finds himself pursued down \nthe street by them the next. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. Opinion among \nMoscow Bolsheviks was very agitated; the City Party Committee \nsecretary P. Mikhail Tomski, who had supported Lenin in the 'trade \nunion discussion' and headed the Central Council of the trade union \nmovement on behalf of the party, was deputed to present a motion in \nline with official party policy. 121 But Lenin, when he heard of \nthis, was infuriated. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. Lenin \nstunned his colleagues by invoking the Party Congress resolution on \nparty unity and demanding the exclusion of Tomski from the Central \nCommittee and even the party itself. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. \nResourcefully and angrily Lenin proposed to convoke a joint meeting \nof the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission as a \nsort of court to try Tomski. Dzierzynski as a supporter of internal \nparty discipline backed Lenin. And yet Lenin felt he had to back down \nsince he had 'only an insignificant majority' in the Central Committee \nfor such ruthlessness against Tomski. 124 \nQuietly the matter was dropped, and Lenin was left to allow his ire to \nexpire. 125 Perforce the Conference's organisation was \nhurried and ramshackle; but Lenin was reconciled to its necessity. Once more the individual performance of Lenin would be \ncrucial. 126 239 delegates assembled \nin the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin on 26 May 1921 to hear their \nleadership's account of themselves. 127 \nLenin's opening report summarised his recently-published pamphlet \nOn The Food Tax; he moved through its points with a few explanatory \nremarks. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. 131 Their words were like extra \nchapters to Lenin's booklet; they constituted a case for New Economic \nPolicy not merely to be accepted but also extended into other areas of \nthe economy. Five lengthy lectures had come \nfrom Lenin, Milyutin, Khinchuk, Sviderski and Preobrazhenski. Vareikis, like speakers after him, \nattacked Lenin. However cleverly Lenin had positioned himself under \nthe shelter of the Central Committee, he failed to dispel the perception \nthat he was the architect of the reform. Vareikis, a Bolshevik \nsophisticated in the party's doctrines, challenged the Marxist validity \nof Lenin's attitude to the peasantry. Lenin in previous works had \ndescribed the peasantry as a feudal class in an advanced stage of \ndisintegration, under the impact of capitalist economic development, \ninto two antagonistic new classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; \nhe had also stressed in the Party Programme that the party should \nenhance the interests of the poorer and middling segments of the \npeasantry. He scrutinised Lenin's pamphlet \nwith acidic wit.135 Now that Lenin's own proposed ideas, theses and booklet \nwere being savaged, Larin remarked: 'At this moment, comrades, I \nwould remind comrade Lenin that writing theses is a rottenjobl' 136 His \nsubstantive contention was that the New Economic Policy should give \ngreater attention to large-scale industry and the plight of the urban \nworking class. Lenin had touched a \nraw nerve in his opening report by demanding that the local party \ncommittees should exercise greater initiative in fulfilling the Tenth \nCongress's resolutions. Chubar added to Lenin's woes. Like Vareikis, he called for a policy which discriminated more \nstrictly between the rich and the poor of the village; and he suggested \nthat Lenin should offer 'not belles lettres but something definite' about \nthe attitude to be taken to rural capitalism. Always the target was Lenin. 141 Not a single \ndelegate rose in Lenin's defence. Their words were supportive of Lenin; \nthis was important since by then it was clear that he was being held \nindividually culpable. In short, Lenin's report had been out of touch with the real \nsituation.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement.' To Vareikis's enquiry whether \nthe peasantry constituted a class, Lenin gave a positive but curt answer: \nhe refused to open a dialogue over this important aspect of Marxist \ntheory} 44 \nThe pressure on the central party leadership remained. Lenin had been absent for most of the report. \nLenin rasped that in the two months since the Party Congress \nillnesses had struck the Central Committee. 148 \nLenin implied that the work of the Central Committee had fallen \nentirely upon his shoulders. 149 Yet \nLenin failed to add was that the Politburo had filled the breach. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 50 \nNonetheless Lenin had indisputably carried a greater load than the \nrest, and the load involved a concatenation of crises in the economy, \nadministration, politics, security and foreign policy. \nLenin had seen red. Coming from Lenin, it sounded utterly serious. \nLenin, still infuriated, told the Conference that he hoped that this case \nof insubordination to the Central Committee would be the last. Tomski's \npro-worker orientation was, in Lenin's opinion, a sign of such a \ndanger. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it. Essentially he wanted \nconfirmation that he had done his best and that his measures were \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \napproved. Lenin \nsat down, battered but victorious at last. Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. \nHe was exercised by the possibilities of socialist revolutions in Europe. \nAlready, as he admitted, there were controversies among Politburo \nmembers as to whether the Communist International confronted a \nperiod of 'quiescence' when the capitalist economies would stabilise \nthemselves and prevent revolutionary conturbation. Bumazhny attacked Lenin. For Bumazhny, Lenin's On the Food Tax was aimed at too \nsophisticated a readership. Lenin had misjudged the needs of situation: \nthe ordinary party members as wen as the Bolshevik inte11ectua1 elite \nhad to be addressed. But Lenin replied dismissively. This time Lenin reacted more diplomatically. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. The \nConference had been gruelling, and had put Lenin on his mettle. 164 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDIVIDED RETREAT \nThe Conference had barely finished when, supplied with suitable drafts \nfrom the Central Committee, Sovnarkom embarked on a legislative \ncampaign to extend the New Economic Policy. The lines sketched by \nLenin, Milyutin, Khinchuk, Sviderski, and Preobrazhenski were \npursued with panache. \nLenin had been the only Politburo member to speak at the \nConference; but thereafter he said even less about the New Economic \nPolicy than in the months of spring. Nikolai Valentinov, an ex-Bolshevik who had many contacts \nwith the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, recorded having heard that \nVareikis shouted that Lenin had lopped off 'whole chapters of \nMarxism'. Lenin is said to have retorted: 'Please don't try giving me \ntraining as to what to take and what to leave out of Marxism: hens \naren't taught by their eggs. It was not until October \nthat Lenin recommenced his public defence of reform. Commemorat-\ning the fourth anniversary of the Bolshevik party's seizure of power, he \nwrote in Pravda: 'Would that such a global affair could be begun \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n215 \nwithout failures and without mistakes. Illness prevented Lenin's attendance and \nKamenev deputised for him. 177 \nLenin's health improved sufficiently on 23 December for him to \naddress the Ninth Congress of Soviets; and, although the old fire was \nevident, he offered no promise of immediate economic betterment. Indeed cognoscenti of Lenin's agrarian analysis in 1917 \nwould have noticed how closely Preobrazhenski followed it;179 Lenin \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould not dismiss his critic out of hand. But Preobrazhenski, who until \nthen had worked harmoniously with Lenin, irritated him more than \nany other leading Bolshevik opponent at the time. Lenin castigated the 'empty' phrases and \n'boring' expressions of intent. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future.' 182 \nThis was the sort of rhetorical souffle which, if cooked by a \nProvisional Government minister in 1917 or a Bolshevik opositionist in \n1918-1920, Lenin would have relished puncturing. Lenin, despite a certain success in \ninhibiting the growth of a highly abstract discussion of Marxist theory, \ncould not reasonably abort deliberations on particular issues. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. 183 \nIn fact all Bolshevik leaders were committed to the reinforcement of \ncentral state planning sooner or later; and Lenin was no exception \neither in 1921 or thereafter. He could not stress too heavily that Bolshevik hegemony \nover contemporary issues of politics, economics and culture should be \nmaintained, 184 and he kept a weather eye open for those anti-\nBolsheviks seeking to take advantage of the reforms introduced by \nthe Politburo. Lenin reviewed the Maslov \nbook in a few brief words worthy less of the Times Literary Supplement \nthan of the polemical tracts of John Calvin or Huldreich Zwingli: \n'From a glance it is evident that this is a disgusting little bourgeois \nbook through and through, conning the peasant with its exhibitionistic \nbourgeois \"scientific\" falsehood' .185 \nBut he could not be so scathing about Trotski: cordial relations \namong Politburo colleagues had to be maintained. Even as Lenin had been \ninitiating discussions on agrarian reform in February 1921, he was \nchairing Sovnarkom sessions which required Gosplan to draw up a \nsingle comprehensive plan for all sectors of the economy. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed. Lenin promoted \nthe change and disliked Trotski's proposal on the grounds that it would \nlead to bureaucratic meddling. The Central Committee, while not \ndenying the need for a central state economic plan, sided with Lenin in \nrefusing to provide Gosplan with the more ambitious rights requested \nfor it by Trotski. Scarcely had the ashes of the \n'trade union discussion' been raked into the earth than Trotski and \nLenin were lighting a touch-paper for yet another inflammation of the \nparty. No wonder that \nLenin had been acting cautiously with his day-to-day tactics since the \nTenth Party Conference. Not for the first time he must have mused \nwhether those calling themselves Leninists were really on his side.", "Lenin_1918": " 1 Merciless Retreat \n'THE CURRENT TASKS OF SOVIET POWER' \nLenin was a mercurial mixture as a political leader. \nLenin, unlike Muhammed and Cromwell, made a virtue out of \nchangeability. The changes made by the Bolsheviks in \ntheir policies after the October Revolution of 1917 were drastic. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. Public \nopinion had been prepared by Bolshevik propaganda, insofar as such \npropaganda had any effect, for a revolutionary process unmarred by \nproblems. Officers in their thousands \nfrom the demobilised Imperial Army were assembling in southern \nRussia and in mid-Siberia; their objective was the overthrow of Lenin's \nregime. \nSovnarkom, as Lenin's government was known, had survived for a \nnumber of reasons. His Decree on Land gave him credit with the \npeasants, and the Bolsheviks at least did well among the working class \nand garrison soldiers in the Constituent Assembly elections. The \nexhausting conditions of everyday life also worked in the Bolshevik \nparty's favour. Yet the Bolsheviks could not afford to be \ncomplacent. Lenin had not lost his faith in the inevitability of \ncommunism's global triumph; but he recognised the weaknesses of \nthe party's position. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Every leading Bolshevik appreciated \nthe acuteness of the regime's crisis. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nNo Bolshevik leader was in greater danger than Lenin. About his likely \nfate in the event of the Bolshevik party's overthrow there could be little \ndoubt. Aside from such \nblack propaganda, however, Lenin was undeniably more responsible \nthan any fellow Bolshevik for the actions of his party. The timing and \nmethod of the seizure of power in October 1917 were largely his choice, \nand Sovnarkom's programme was mainly of his making. But Lenin \nhad to live with the consequences and was in no mood to regret or \napologise. Lenin's political friends were sorely in need of guidance. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Nor was \nhis own Bolshevik party quiescent. Lenin's proposals \ntook the form of a lengthy pamphlet written in the second fortnight of \n1918. Pamphleteering was his most congenial medium of communica-\ntion with fellow Bolsheviks except for speeches to their Congresses. But Lenin was an experienced journalist and \ncould write fast and, when he set his mind to it, forcefully. The result \nwas The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Lenin avoided reference to \nopponents in the Bolshevik party and mentioned the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries only fleetingly. The Brest-Litovsk treaty, that momentous treaty \nwhich had ended hostilities on the Eastern front in the Great War, was \n 4 \nLenin: A Political Life \nscarcely cited. \nHe was astonishingly casual about armed resistance to the \nBolsheviks. Bogaevski had just been \ncaptured and executed, and this event was adduced by Lenin as a \nsign that the phase of 'open civil war' had now passed. Possibly his dismissal of the potential military threat was a \nmere device to fix Bolshevik eyes on the politics and the economy. Lenin seldom failed to bang the war-drum when \nalarmed about the future. Residing in the \nKremlin in Moscw and hearing about events elsewhere in Russia only \nintermittently, Lenin simply blundered.4 The party's priority, according to Lenin, should be the \nintroduction of strict account-keeping and control. Lenin's basic aim was less to create an atmosphere of \nliberation than to get labourers, skilled and unskilled, to raise their \nlevel of discipline and productivity. In Lenin's estimation, the \noccurrence of the October Revolution made Taylor's techniques \ndeployable without damage to the working class's interests. 10 \nLenin admitted that all this constituted a 'compromise', even a \n'retreat' from unbridled revolutionary optimism. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished. 'But our \nrevolutionary courts and our popular courts,' lamented Lenin, 'are \nexceedingly, incredibly weak. But attack was preferable to defence for Lenin: 'We don't \nneed hysterical outbursts.' \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOPPOSITION AND SURVIVAL \nThe resistance was beginning to cause panic. It would be an \nexaggerated claim that, had Lenin cracked under the strain, the \nBolsheviks would have gone under. 15 The fervid atmosphere seemed to \nleave Lenin cool.' 16 The capacity to close off his mind to distractions was \naccompanied by an ability to impart his confidence to the rest of the \nBolshevik central leadership. According to Trotski, Lenin had the \nadvantage of obviously 'believing in that which he said' .17 \nEven the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who wanted to see the treaty \nof Brest-Litovsk torn up, did not envisage Lenin's permanent removal \nfrom the chairmanship of Sovnarkom. Karl Radek, a Bolshevik \nopponent of the treaty, was approached by the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Pavel Proshyan at a meeting of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets with the question: \n'Wouldn't it be simpler to arrest Lenin for a day, declare war on the \nGermans and then wholeheartedly elect comrade Lenin again as \nSovnarkom chairman.' 18 The matter was not just personal (although a \nrecognition of Lenin's exceptional qualities as a leader was involved). \nThe Left Communists and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also judged \nthat any split with Lenin would cause a destructive narrowing of the \npolitical base of the October Revolution. The Urals Regional \nCommittee and the Moscow Regional Committee, as well as the \nTaganrog Conference of Bolsheviks fleeing from Ukraine in the path of \nthe German military occupation, were vehemently hostile to Brest-\nLitovsk and all it stood for. 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees.21 \n Merciless Retreat \n7 \nAt the same time Lenin no more wanted to lose the Left Communists \nthan they him.22 Lenin saw that the Bolsheviks \nwere too few to be able to dispense with a faction's assistance; but the \nwords of the decision reflect also his condescension to the Left \nCommunists as being given to light-headed abstractions in their \nthinking. They were centralisers to an even higher \ndegree than Lenin. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. Bukharin had \nalready produced a pamphlet entitled The Programme of the \nCommunists (Bolsheviks). Lenin \nconsequently had reason to fear Bukharin's return to the fold. They were still more utopian and incoherent than Lenin;24 but \nin practice, like him, they tended to support centralist force against \nlocally-established collective endeavours whenever they had to make a \nchoice. Lenin saw this as he \ntackled the shortages of food supplies in Russian cities in April and \nMay 1918. Tsyurupa as People's Commissar for Food Supplies \nrequested plenipotentiary powers to requisition grain throughout the \ncountry, and Lenin agreed with him. Tsyurupa's draft decree bluntly threatened sanctions \n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nagainst anyone not complying with the law.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. Lenin recommended \na minimum of ten years' forced labour and permanent expulsion from \nthe village commune in any case of hoarding. On 9 May a further discussion took place and Lenin's \namendment was rejected. Lenin kept up the pressure.30 Lenin's blood was up. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. But Bolsheviks of all persuasions hardly \ncared. Lenin and his opponents in his own party \nhad found common cause once more, and were relieved that they could \nwork together again. 31 \n Merciless Retreat \n9 \nNot only Lenin but also his colleagues were recklessly narrowing the \npolitical base of their regime. Bolsheviks were made \nanxious by the rise in working-class antipathy to themselves. The discontent \nwas simply transferred to other arenas: anti-Bolshevik sentiment found \nexpression in the growing popularity of the movement for an Assembly \nof Plenipotentiaries among Petrograd workers. The Putilov Works, which in 1917 had \nprominently supported the Bolshevik political advance, came out in \nsympathy with the Kolpino demonstrators. 32 But Lenin was in no \nmood to yield. Lenin was pre-occupied by the diplomatic \nand military crisis rather than rendered cowardly by the prospect of \njustifying his policies to the Central Executive Committee. Five days later, on 14 \nMay, Lenin returned to the political fray and castigated the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with ferocity. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries continued to \nparticipate fitfully in public affairs over the ensuing three years, but \nalways on Bolshevik terms. That Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik Central Committee \nshould have rushed so fast to impose such a dictatorship is evidence of \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir extraordinary confidence that, despite the terrific reverses \nendured by them at home and abroad since October 1917, history \nwas on their side. Lenin was extremely \ndull about anticipating the scale and timing of outbreaks of civil war.39 \nWhere Trotski lurched, Lenin followed. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. Lenin received an appeal for assistance \nfrom the Penza Bolshevik leader Minkin.41 Lenin and Trotski \nwere digging a hole for themselves, but refused to stop digging. Komuch asserted that it had the most legitimate claim to \nrule the country, and called for the overthrow of the Bolshevik party \ndictatorship. A half-day's train \njourney separated them from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and \nLenin. \nNonetheless it still appeared to the Central Committee under Lenin \nthat political retreat and reconciliation would endanger the regime to a \ngreater extent than pursuit of the existing policies. Lenin also \nrefused to be intimidated by the resumption of assassinations as a tactic \nby the Socialist Revolutionaries. \nSuch doubts as Lenin entertained he did not express. Martov was the \nworld's greatest Lenin-watcher, and claimed to be able to detect a \nmuffled uncertainty in his speeches in mid-1918. Supposedly Lenin was \nquestioning whether the Brest-Litovsk treaty had really been worth \nsigning. His arguments against Bukharin and the Left Communists, \naccording to Martov, were essentially a means of persuading himself as \nmuch as the Left Communists: 'The nub of the matter here is not a \nstruggle of citizen Lenin with some group standing to his left, but \nrather an inner struggle of the two souls which constitute contempor-\nary Bolshevism. '43 \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMartov, for once in his life, underestimated Lenin's determination. \nPossibly the Bolshevik leader may have been wondering whether the \nbenefits of the treaty were as great as he had originally supposed; but \nnot for a moment did he deny that the signature of a separate peace \nwith Germany and Austria-Hungary was a better option than any \nconceivable alternative. Lenin \nwaited on events, and did not have to wait long. On 24 June the Central \nCommittee of the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries met secretly \nto approve the assassination of German diplomats in Moscow. The Left Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leaders hoped that this would lead to a rapprochement of their \nparty and the Bolsheviks in the cause of revolutionary war. \nIntimations of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary conspiracy reached the \nears of Felix Dzierzynski, Bolshevik chairman of the Cheka, on 28 \nJune. Yet victory for the Bolsheviks was already guaranteed by \ntheir majority over the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of voting places. Lenin had no \n Merciless Retreat \n13 \nhesitation. Blyumkin's murderous action gave the Bolsheviks a \nchance to behave as if reacting to an outrage rather than merely \npersecuting fellow socialists. Lenin had it in mind to arrest \nand execute a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee. Disposi-\ntions were made for the detention of Left Socialist-Revolutionary \ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets in the Bolshoi Theatre. Lenin was realistically contemptuous about the \npotential strength of the armed resistance to his forces. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. 50 \nLenin acted speedily for two reasons. First, he wanted to catch the \nLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries unawares. The sole advantage to \nBerlin in retaining the Bolsheviks in power was their adherence to \nBrest-Litovsk. Without this, Lenin would be useless to the Germans. 51 \nLenin carried out the mission with distaste. In March, when the \nBrest-Litovsk treaty was being signed, he had firmly refused to attend \nthe ceremony: he wanted to limit his association with what he described \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas 'the obscene peace'.'52 On arrival at the embassy, Lenin carried out the necessary \nformalities.53 \nLenin was glad to leave the embassy a few minutes later. To their horror they saw that the \nBolsheviks aimed at their suppression. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \nLenin resumed practical control.57 Yet he may also have begun to understand that the \nbalance of forces, ill-trained as most of them were on both sides, might \nsuddenly change to the disadvantage of the Bolsheviks.59 Yet \nTrotski can hardly have been high in Lenin's esteem at the time. The \npreservation of 'Soviet power' depended entirely upon the loyalty and \nefficiency of a Latvian officer who was neither a Bolshevik nor a \nproven military officer. \nFortunately for Lenin, Vacietis completed his task splendidly. The former \ncoalition partners of the Bolsheviks went down to defeat; almost \nwithout noticing it, Lenin and the core of Bolshevik Central Committee \nmembers had passed over the threshold from a two-party revolutionary \ndictatorship into an outright dictatorship by one party. \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMANOEUVRE, RETREAT, WAIT \nLenin knew that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk depended entirely on the \nGerman government's intentions, and that these in turn were shaped \nby success or failure for German forces on the Western front. \nLenin did not lie supine in the meantime.63 The Bolsheviks deferred to Bertin; their \nforces were pathetically incompetent to resist. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement.'65 But what did Lenin say to \nthose who claimed that, since Brest-Litovsk, he had no independent \npolicy.67 \nPlaying one capitalist power against another was, Lenin urged, the sole \noption available in the circumstances. Lenin's political survival depended on Allied military \nsuccess in the West at least until such time as the long-expected \nrevolution should break out in Berlin. Every political party in Russia regarded the \nBolsheviks as traitors. \nNot even Lenin wished to give public display of such submissiveness. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism.77 The vote went four to one in favour of Lenin's policy \nof continued appeasement of Germany. Lenin's high-risk strategy did not go unperceived \nas such. Lenin was especially keen \nto secure backing from Trotski, who had been on the left side in the \nBrest-Litovsk controversy.79 Trotski and Zinoviev \nbacked Lenin.80 His \nsupport for Lenin disproved this. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were \nrecognised in Berlin as godless and anti-monarchical. On 10 June, \nLenin rebuked the Bolsheviks in Kuban for mounting an attack on \nGerman troops in Taganrog, and similar instructions were issued two \ndays later to Red Army and Bolshevik party personnel on the Southern \nfront: no military engagement with the Germans was permissible. 84 Lenin not only wanted to exhibit enthusiasm for \nBrest-Litovsk; he also increasingly wished to enlist the Germans in \ndefence of Soviet-held territory against further landings by the Allies. This information was as yet unavailable \nto Lenin. Yet Lenin anyway \nconsidered he had little choice. Consequently Lenin was even willing on 13 \nAugust to risk inviting the Germans, through Chicherin, to bomb \nArkhangelsk on Sovnarkom's behalf. Vorovski, Lenin asserted that 'we would \nbe idiots not to make use' of the confluence of Soviet and German \ngovernmental interests. The Germans and \nRussians had initialled a supplementary treaty to the Brest-Litovsk \narrangements on 10 August, and this was formally signed on 27 \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAugust. Lenin had misled himself. But \nBrest-Litovsk had at least ensured the sheer survival of the Bolsheviks \nin power. It was an achievement of Lenin's gamble in international \nrelations. \nTHE WRITING OF A CONSTITUTION \nLenin scoffed at constitutionalism in politics. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above. The \nBrest-Litovsk dispute pre-occupied the minds of both the Bolsheviks \nand the Left SRs.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Sverdlov was commission chairman, and \nStalin was included as the Bolshevik official expert on the question of \nthe nationalities.90 Notable by his absence was Lenin. \nThe federal basis of the forthcoming Constitution had been \nestablished, on Lenin's recommendation, at the Third Congress of \n Merciless Retreat \n21 \nSoviets in January 1918.93 Sovnarkom at present \nruled only Russia- and not all Russia at that.96 The contrast with Lenin was \nimpressive. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress.98 Yet Lenin was \nso unexercised by the constitutional question that he did nothing until \nSverdlov's commission reported back to the Central Committee.99 \nStalin was in any case closer to Lenin's viewpoint than were other \ncommission members. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. The Left Socialist-Revolutionary went further: 'Comrade \nStalin has got so accustomed to such a situation that he has perfectly \nassimilated even the jargon of imperialism. Reisner teased him for \nadvocating exactly the 'anarchic' ideas espoused by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution. This booklet, which had recently been published but \nhad been written in mid-1917, envisaged a revolutionary order with \nmuch greater scope for popular initiative than Lenin was willing to \ntolerate by 1918. All he could \nsay in reply was: 'Mention has been made here of comrade Lenin. I \nwould permit myself to remark that Lenin, so far as I know - and I \nknow very well -, has said that this project is worthless.' 103 Some \nBolshevik members remained unhappy with his performance. The need \nfor any reference to national issues rankled so much that Pokrovski, a \nBolshevik, preferred Reisner's draft. Lenin and \nStalin in 1917 had taken pains to get the slogan of national self-\ndetermination accepted in the Bolshevik party, and were convinced \nthat its deployment would help the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Lenin began to take an interest from a \ndistance. His main ambition for the Constitution was for it to rouse \nworkers and peasants to support the Bolsheviks. Lenin seized control, \npersuading his colleagues on the Central Committee to include an \n Merciless Retreat \n23 \nentirely new preamble. Instead he \nsubstituted a text already accepted at the Third Congress of Soviets, \nnamely 'The Declaration of Rights of the Labouring and Exploited \nPeople' submitted by Lenin to the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.105 \nSverdlov, understandably miffed, behaved like a disciplined \nBolshevik and induced the commission to comply on 17 June. 106 The \nBolshevik Central Committee, looking at the result nine days later, was \nunimpressed. Lenin even threatened to remove the Constitution from \nthe agenda of the forthcoming Congress of Soviets. 109 Its final draft was \nperused by the Central Committee, in the presence of Lenin and \nTrotski, on 3 July. A last effort at polishing the style, but not the contents, was \nentrusted to Yuri Steklov; and it was Steklov, a leading ex-Menshevik \nwriter and editor, who was instructed to present the draft Constitution \nto the Fifth Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918.' 11 By then the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionary revolt had been suppressed. Lenin did not even bother to speak at the Congress of \nSoviets session. But the Bolshevik party leadership cynically hoped to \nattract the support of non-Russian peoples by showing off federalism \nas a slogan. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power.' 114 Here was yet another sign that Lenin \napproached the commission's draft without his customary attentive-\nness. Lenin had argued at length in his recently-published State and \nRevolution that socialism would be an entirely distinct phase of history \nbetween capitalism and communism. 115 It was Lenin who made this inference for the first time, \nand it is by no means proven that he had correctly understood the \nstandpoint of Marx; but it quickly became a tenet of Bolshevism. Yet \nLenin did not intend to agitate himself and his comrades over a \nquestion of Marxism which since 1917 had been dear to him. 118 The same section implicitly \ncleared the ground for the Bolsheviks to outlaw any political parties, \norganisations or newspapers. Vladimir Lenin would only \nbother with constitutional trifles when his current political purposes \nwere threatened. Trotski, Dzierzynski and Lenin \nconfronted a near-disastrous military situation. \nThe Bolshevik leaders had also seen the uses of the prisoners-of-war \ntaken by Russian armies in 1914-1917, especially those from the lands \nof the Hapsburg monarchy (and the Constitution itself had been \nformulated so as to grant citizenship to all foreigners working in Russia \nor fighting in the Red Army). Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. 126 \nTrotski's efforts were intensified when the Czechoslovak Legion, on \nentering into Samara, put itself at the disposal of the Komuch \ngovernment of Socialist Revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the \nBolsheviks in Moscow. \nBonch-Bruevich (who, despite his anti-socialist convictions, was \nbrother to Lenin's personal assistant Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich). Lenin stayed in Moscow in \nAugust. The \nfollowing note was dispatched to Trotski from Lenin: 'I'm sure that the \nsuppression of the Czechs and White Guards, as well as the \nbloodsucking kulaks who support them, will be a model of \nmercilessness.' 130 \n Merciless Retreat \n27 \nIf Lenin harboured a suspicion that Trotski might wage war in too \nsensitive a spirit, he had misjudged him. This \nprovoked outrage in the Bolshevik party. Rozengolts headed the court martial, was unrepentant \nand sought Lenin's support on 23 October. This was Lenin's birthplace.' Lenin had approved a scheme to expropriate ecclesiastical \nand historic valuables; but, since such a step might have caused \npopular indignation, the telegram was marked 'highly secret'. Lenin failed to understand the \ngeographical limitations of the Red victory. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards. \nLenin was not the sole Bolshevik to exult, and Pravda editorials were \nunderstandably keen to emphasise the successes in battle. Yet the \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncentral party leaders, both in the Kremlin and by the Volga, had little \nknowledge about other Russian forces being formed to attack the \nReds. Undoubtedly he would have laughed to \nread Lenin's carefree command for an immediate cleansing of Siberia. Yet Lenin referred to none of them in his telegrams in \n1918.", "Lenin_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. A question \nof the same order arises in connection with Lenin: would the history of \nthe USSR have been greatly different if premature illness had not \nended his life. \nIt is necessary to pause before proceeding to the dramatic last \nmonths of Lenin's career in order to take stock of the issues. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. But Lenin's \njudgement is not reliable. Nothing said \nor done by the dying Lenin suggested that he had changed his mind on \nsuch fundamental essentials of post-October Leninism.2 \n291 \n 292 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe fact remains that the USSR suffered unbridled mass terror in the \nI 930s. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. We cannot be sure; but it is also improbable that the War \nCommunist methods used in the late I 920s to pulverise the peasantry \ninto submission and undertake the collectivisation of agriculture by \nmain force would have occurred to Lenin as a desirable project. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Nobody proclaimed Lenin's \nconstancy more loudly than that other great claimant to his mantle: \nLev Trotski. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought. He also tried to indicate that, had he lived, Lenin would have \nespoused policies identical with Trotski's.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. \nBukharin was to assert that, as they talked in the beautiful gardens \nand woods at Gorki, Lenin confided a novel idea of the possibilities of \na 'transition to socialism'.4 Lenin purportedly had come to believe that the local \npeasant community could be persuaded eventually to tum itself into a \ncollective farm and that this transformation, be it accomplished only at \na snail's pace, would be the decisive factor in the party's revolutionary \nstrategy. Thus it is proposed that Bukharinism was \nsimply the latest version of Leninism approved by Lenin in his own \nlifetime. And yet Lenin's plans for the New Economic Policy do not \nsustain the notion that he had switched to a fully evolutionary \nprognosis. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. \nNot that Bukharin did not have his points of accord with Lenin in \nthis period. He supported Lenin's line on the national question; but he \nwas also opposed to Lenin in the foreign-trade dispute and had been \ncomplicit in the deception of Lenin when Mariya Volodicheva handed \nLenin's dictated notes to Stalin. Bukharin was his own man, and \ndiffered from Lenin on other basic questions of policy. While \nLenin's emphasis lay upon the introduction of literacy and account-\nkeeping, Bukharin looked forward to workers developing their own \ncultural practices and institutions to replace 'bourgeois' dominion in \nsocial thought.6 \nBolshevik leaders shared in politics more than they individually held \napart. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. It is not inconceivable that Bolshevik policies might \nhave been diverted on to a more peaceful, evolutionary path if the \nparty had been less centralised, if ordinary party members had had a \ngreater impact and if the brutalisation of politics in Russia had not \ngone to extraordinary lengths in the years immediately after the seizure \nof power in Petrograd. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. But privately he \nput it more starkly; for Lenin, the question was: 'Who leads.'8 Lenin the class warrior was \nnot politically defunct. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922. The Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate had not satisfactorily discharged the task of supervising \nand controlling its operations, and Lenin emphasised that the \nintroduction of workers to the Central Committee would improve \n Deaths and Entrances \n295 \nthe situation. 10 Lenin's similar criticism \nindicated that Trotski and he were drawing together. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. According to Lenin, the Pole had displayed 'a \ntruly Russian attitude'. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. \nLenin had also asserted that only the People's Commissariat of \nExternal Affairs was reliably devoid of influential figures from the old \nregime; and yet he failed to prescribe a remedy. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation. This was that Bolsheviks, while \nkeeping the USSR in existence, should accept that the plans for \nconstitutional integration might have to be dropped. He mentioned that the \nBolshevik-led republics would stay under general party discipline, \nand that any breakdown in co-ordination 'between Moscow and the \nother centres can be paralysed by party authority'.24 Lenin's passion was \ndistinct in every line, and this final political campaign was being \nmounted by a very determined 'Old Man'.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. Lenin guessed that he \nmight not have put a fully cogent case, and added: 'This circumstance \nmay appear an irrelevant triviality. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority).30 All that is \ncertain is that Lenin wanted to prevent Stalin from realising his \npotential to become the dominant Bolshevik leader; it is not even clear \nthat Stalin in Lenin's intention would be excluded from the Central \nCommittee. \nWith remarkable tenacity the sick Lenin meanwhile produced \narticles in abundance for Pravda. It centred on a \n1920 survey of literacy in Russia. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). Lenin, \nunder his wife's influence, acknowledged that 'a new posing of \nquestions of pedagogy' was desirable; but apparently this would \nmainly involve a reconsideration of the treatment of religion in the \nschools; and he urged that propagandists should emphasise the \nallegation that Jesus Christ had never lived.33 \n Deaths and Entrances \n299 \nNothing in these considerations was at variance with Lenin's previous \nwritings.36 Inverted commas embraced the adjective: Lenin sensed that \nits usage bore a resemblance to the kind of remark made by Victorian \ncapitalist philanthropists. After all, his wife \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nGalina had put their flat at the disposal of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee on 10 October 1917 when the decision to seize power had \nbeen taken.40 Menshevism had traditionally adhered to the principle \nthat, until capitalism had reached economic and cultural maturity in a \ngiven country, it would be dangerous and futile to inaugurate 'the \ntransition to communism'; and this continued to be Sukhanov's \nobjection to Bolshevik strategy. \nLenin postulated that Sukhanov displayed 'the pedantry of all our \npetit-bourgeois democrats'. There were bound to be 'several partial novelties' in the \nestablishment of socialism under the Bolsheviks. \nLenin freely conceded that, in Marxist terminology, the level of \n'development of the productive forces' was too low for the immediate \ninception of socialism in Russia.'43 No question \nmark appeared at the end of the sentence, indicating that Lenin \nassumed that its contents were sufficiently self-evident to provoke no \ncontradiction.44 \nNapoleon Bonaparte's dictum was recalled by Lenin: 'On s'engage et \npuis .48 \nInstead Lenin adduced Marx's hope (as expressed in a letter of 1856) \nthat a dual revolt of workers and peasants might overthrow German \ncapitalism.49 The Bolsheviks in Lenin's view followed this tradition. To \nhis dying breath, he avoided recourse to Marx's favourable comments \non the Russian populists, who wanted to base a socialist society upon \nwhat they took to be the egalitarian practices and potential of the \npeasant village commune; he opposed agrarian socialism: his Marxism \ncontinued to hymn the virtues of workers, towns and large-scale \norganisation. Lenin remained true to himself to the end, and the \nequivocations of Marx himself in the last years of his life were \nignored. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, still \nhad him as its People's Commissar; and Lenin had complained about \nits efficiency. Lenin specified that not even the authority of the \nGeneral Secretary ought to get in the way of the Central Control \nCommission's interventions. \nLenin had originally called upon the Secretariat to be more efficient in \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nits preparation of materials for Politburo sessions. Much as had been done to promote \nworking-class people to administrative position in the Soviet state, he \ndeclared for the first time that such workers were 'insufficently \nenlightened'. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. There \nwere also signs of changes in social policy in the West which, by \nbettering material conditions, might serve to postpone the revolu-\n Deaths and Entrances \n303 \ntionary explosion predicted by Lenin since mid-1914. The \nproblem for the Bolsheviks and the Soviet state was to hold on long \nenough, and he definitively rejected the assumption that the transition \nto socialism in the USSR would be fast. But more \nlikely the entire political camp of capitalism would be distracted from \nan anti-Bolshevik crusade by struggles by their respective colonies for \nnationalliberation.63 \nThe Bolshevik party, hoping for this favourable outcome, should \nconcentrate on the maintenance of the supposed leadership by the \nworkers over the peasantry.64 Lenin the visionary and the \ninspirer of his party declared that 'these are the great tasks I am \ndreaming about'. Pravda printed his \npiece on 4 March 1923. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got. While detesting Trotski, he recognised the danger that \nthe alliance between Lenin and Trotski might constitute. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission). Unlike Lenin, he did not \ntake seriously the threat from Stalin.76 \nLenin had to act fast.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling. The problem for them was that Lenin was \nwell enough to check whether his article was printed. A single copy of the newspaper including the article should \nbe printed for Lenin's benefit on 25 January. 79 \nLenin's authority as party leader had not vanished; and, while being \nworried by questions of state administration, he was pre-occupied by \nthe political business in Georgia. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed. They deplored the suggestion by Lenin that, if preventive \nmeasures were not taken, a split in the central party leadership was a \ndistinct possibility.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. A strong hint was \ndropped that Lenin, divorced from participation in Politburo \ndiscussions, was not really au fait with current issues.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities. Thus, although permission was given on I \nFebruary for them to inspect the official materials at the basis of \nDzierzynski's report, Lenin had to accept that several weeks would be \nrequired for them to assess them properly.85 Lenin remonstrated with \nVolodicheva: 'Ifl had my freedom, I could easily do all this for myself. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. '89 \nOn the same day he asked Trotski to take up the Georgian \nBolsheviks' case on his behalf. Simultaneously Lenin was developing tactics with ever \ngreater confidence (even though his physical condition was worsening \nas a result of his mental agitation).93 All this was kept from Lenin as he \ndictated a note to Mdivani and Makharadze: 'With all my heart I am \nfollowing your cause.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. His note as deposited in Lenin's office referred to \nthe duty laid upon him to see that no political information reached \nLenin as he convalesced and to Krupskaya's infringements.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. But \ncringe before Lenin he would not. What saved him from \na goring by the bullish Lenin was nothing he did in his own defence but \nthe rapid decline in Lenin's health. But a \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmild, temporary improvement in May 1923 induced the doctors to \nstate that, so long as a specially-upholstered vehicle could be provided \nand driven at a slow pace, the patient should be transferred again to \nGorki. 103 Nadezhda \nKrupskaya and Mariya Ulyanova were in more or less constant \nattendance, and Krupskaya took lessons so as to be able to teach Lenin \nto speak. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. And, despite his \nenormous will-power, Lenin also wept profusely. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). Lenin's sudden collapses into \ntearfulness would now be considered a normal aspect of his medical \ncondition. The doctors treating Lenin were doing their best at \na time when the understanding of the brain was at a much lower level \n Deaths and Entrances \n309 \nthan today. Krupskaya had every right to be sceptical about the \ndoctors; and Lenin, remembering that his father had died of the same \nillness in his early fifties, had cause for his underlying pessimism. An appeal based on \nthe opportunity for work was the likeliest to get through to Lenin. This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. But she reckoned \nwithout Lenin's physical recuperation. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. None of them were Bolsheviks: Lenin had \na highly-developed contempt for those among his comrades who had \nqualified as doctors. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. Lenin's evident intention \nhad been to present his thoughts as dictated to Fotieva and \nVolodicheva in the preceding winter to the assembled delegates (even \nif someone else would have had to read them out aloud). This involved an attack on the one leader, apart from Lenin, \nwho was clearly hostile to him: Trotski. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. 135 Nothing could better illustrate \nTrotski's lack of political nous: the premium on being perceived as \n Deaths and Entrances \n313 \nLenin's faithful follower had never been higher. On \n16 April, Lidiya Fotieva returned to her duties after an absence over \nnearly three weeks and informed Stalin, Kamenev and Trotski that \nLenin had told her, shortly before his last attack, that he intended soon \nto publish the article on Georgia and the national question which he \nhad dictated on 31 December 1922}36 Both Kamenev and Trotski had \ndiscussed its contents. 137 \nTrotski and, at first, Kamenev favoured publication in accordance \nwith Lenin's newly-reported wishes. 139 Trotski retorted that \nhe had had no knowledge that Lenin had wanted immediate \npublication, and Stalin backed down in conversation with him. 141 Further consultations \nled to a decision on 18 April to divulge Lenin's article not to the party \nat large nor even to the Twelfth Congress as a whole but instead only to \nthe heads of provincial delegations to the Congress. \nStalin also knew that, in Bolshevik debates on the national question in \nthe past, he himself had been closer to the core of his party's opinion \nthan had Lenin; and he continued to benefit from the fact that Lenin's \nrecommendation for the sacking of Stalin from the General Secretary-\nship was unknown to the rest of the Politburo. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. 146 \nIn reality he knew that not even Lenin had urged the dissolution of the \nTrancaucasian Federation. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. \nStalin's bid to seem the loyal and trusted adjutant of Lenin continued \nas he presented Lenin's proposals for internal party re-organisation to \nthe Congress. 1411 \n'Lenin' and 'Leninism' had, for the first time, become entirely the \nplaythings of Bolsheviks other than Lenin. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. His \n Deaths and Entrances \n315 \nposition in the Secretariat, whence Lenin had secretly planned to sack \nhim, was secure. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. It was a \nterm ostensibly resisted by Lenin in his active life since he claimed only \nto conserve, replicate and develop the ideas of Marx and Engels. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'.' 54 Kamenev founded a Lenin \nInstitute in Moscow to co-ordinate the research on Lenin and the \npublication of his works. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. 155 The veneration of Lenin burst \nprevious limits: he was seer without equal; he was doughty national \nhero; he was unblemished saint; he was the light of the world. \nThe purpose of the reverential excess was plain: Lenin was to be used \nas a means of gathering support for the central party leaders within the \nparty and for the party in society as a whole. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. 156 Those present would seem to have \nincluded Stalin, Trotski, Kamenev, Bukharin, Kalinin and Rykov. \nKalinin insisted that, if Lenin were suddenly to pass away, his funeral \nshould be a magnificent state occasion. They abhorred the wish to treat Lenin's corpse, whensoever \nit became available as such, as if it were the reliquium of an Orthodox \nChurch saint; their Marxist world-view was offended. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup. Dogged by ill-\nhealth and laden with the image of a disturber of the Leninist party \nleadership, he was tactically outplayed. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "Oppositions_1904": " Parties in opposition confront difficulties by comparison. The opportunity arose at a gathering of the \nForeign League Of Revolutionary Russian Social-Democracy in \nGeneva in October 1903. In \nJanuary 1904 he attended the Party Council, repeating his call for a \nCongress; he denounced the Mensheviks as opportunists and disor-\nganisers.

Trotski, like most other social-democratic \nwriters (ranging from Bogdanov on one side through to Martynov and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMaslov on the other), emphasised how little the position of the \nmonarchy had been changed by the post-1905 'constitutional' \nreforms; the political edifice was basically unaltered.

It appeared in April 1909. The party's internal \nbehaviour before the revolution should prefigure the collectivist, \ndemocratic forms of organisation to be encouraged when society as a \nwhole was launched into the transition from capitalism.

Petersburg led to the setting up of an \nelectoral commission of social-democrats.

Throughout \nthe war, as before, Lenin assumed Russia to be ripe for revolution; 107 \nand, as Social-Democrat announced in its January 1917 issue: 'The \nrevolution is approaching, the government is preparing itself. \nLenin put it as follows: 'The bourgeois-democratic revolution in \nRussia is now already not only a prologue but an inalienable integral \npart of socialist revolution in the West. 159 Social-\n War's Divisions \n125 \nDemocrat in 1916 announced the re-creation of groups in Samara \nand Nizhni Novgorod only to declare, in the same issue, that the \npolice had re-intervened. 160 \nThe authorities had feared lest the link-up between the revolu-\ntionary social-democrats and the striking workers should become \nfirm.

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. 118 \nDemocratic procedures were disregarded. \nThere were eighteen delegates. Topics ranged from the worsening material plight of \nworkers (as well as peasants) to the imperial government's project for \nsocial insurance. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 159 \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906.

There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914. The ascendant \nparty leadership called itself social-democratic. It had \nbecome a 'political detachment of the bourgeoisie'.94 The rightward \nshift of the German Social-Democratic party was not imaginary.

The Central Committee, based mainly in \nthe Russian empire, was to resume charge of a reunited party; and a \ngeneral party newspaper, Social-Democrat, was to be refounded. 8 \nHis demand was aimed at abrogating the arrangements made at the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches.

His pleas for party unity were bound to have an impact on \nthe forthcoming Central Committee meeting.

The \nCentral Committee in May 1911 had called for a Party Confer-\nence. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty.

The Central Committee was to be \nbased mostly in Russia: the final resolution defined it pointedly as \n'the Russian centre of social-democratic work'. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. The designation of Workers' Newspaper as the Central \nCommittee's 'official organ' confirmed the demise of attempts to \ncompromise with Trotski and the other aspirants to a broadly-based \nparty unity. The Central Committee was meant to govern the \nparty, and was not to be encumbered with undesirable emigrant sub-\ncommittees. Thus foreign-based party organisations were required to \nrally round not the Committee of the Foreign Organisation but the \nCentral Committee. 162 The seven elected members of the Central \nCommittee, moreover, were not as solidly pro-Lenin as is usually \nthought. 164 \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev.

Half-heartedness and pessimism were \ndangerous to the party's interest; Lenin urged that social-democrats \nspreading despondency should be 'shot on the spot'. \nTwo months' further work led to the completion of Two Tactics of \nSocial-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution.35 No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. Social-democrats should co-operate with \nall political parties seeking a democratic revolution; but it had to be \nanticipated that the liberals, as untrustworthy as ever, would grasp at \nany chance to cobble together a settlement with the monarchy.

Secondly, \nhe predicted that social-democrats would swiftly be ejected from \npower unless fraternal socialist revolutions occurred in the more \nmature industrial societies of Europe. Social-democrats might \nnot necessarily gain a monopoly of authority. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party.60 \nAs with so many other discussions inside the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party, the argument ultimately returned to the \nagrarian question.61 \nTHE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS \nThe disputes of 1905 covered vast canvasses, and the projects of the \ntheorists were still rudimentary sketches. This \nwould guarantee the social-democrats a toe-hold in the new admini-\nstration.92 \nLenin and Bogdanov, however, disagreed about the structure of the \ncentral party apparatus. Lenin still exhibited fractiousness towards \nthose social-democrats not espousing Bolshevism. The method of election would be socially-\ndiscriminatory. Voters were to be divided into their respective social \nestates and to choose representatives to serve in electoral curiae. Free-ranging in philosophy, Bogdanov in 1905 \nwas dogmatic about the concept of the 'vanguard party'.40 And too bad \nalso for the workers who elected delegates to those same soviets.45 He even \ncharacterised workers as being 'instinctively social-democratic' .46 It \nwas almost as if his pronouncements of 1902, with their denial that the \nworking class could spontaneously evolve socialist ideas, had never \nbeen made.

On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. Social-democrats tried to assess the reasons for \nfailure; and it was agreed that the venture had been undertaken \nwithout the necessary consultation and preparation of opinion outside \nthe party. Paradoxically it was the incautious policy which he and \nothers had urged on the party in spring 1905 that led to the disaster.69 Initially there were two dissenters: Gorev and Lenin. In a note to \nLunacharski, he had stated that social-democrats might have to ally \nwith liberals in order to constrain the emperor to grant democratic \nmethods of election.73 \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction.74 \nIn its other debates, between 12 and 17 December, the Conference \nagreed on the need to re-unite the Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty. The principle of democratic centralism should \nbe established.79 \nOver the winter of 1905-6, however, the political situation in the \ncountry became clearer.

It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Both men expected that the social-democrats would \ntake power only after a period of 'bourgeois rule' (which would follow \nthe autocracy's overthrow). For him, the social-democratic party should be a workers' party \naiming to represent the interests of the working class alone; its \nprogramme had no need for a section directed towards peasants.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902.97 \nThe Iskra leaders strove, by means of the forthcoming Party \nCongress, to shape and fix official social-democratic opinion in their \nmould. \nSocial-democratic leaders back in Russia, notably those belonging to \nSouthern Worker's editorial board and to the Bund, joined with the \nLeague Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad to convoke a meeting in \nBialystok. \nAfter the socialist takeover of power in the distant future, Plekhanov \nargued, a social-democratic government might well not immediately \nfeel safe to submit itselfto electoral competition at regular intervals. Lenin's supporter S. On 10 August the delegates \ndiscussed the party's attitude to other anti-autocratic political groups. Yet this last question required some answers: how close \ncould social-democrats draw to the political parties of the middle class.", "Social_Democrats_1915": " Great events can break individuals on their wheel, and \nthis is what he thought had happened to the German Social-\nDemocratic Party leadership. The earliest of such initiatives \nhad come with a meeting of representatives from the Allied countries \nin London in February 1915 and a meeting in Vienna for socialist \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparties from the Central Powers in April 1915. Steadily, however, \nthe ambition of many participants widened and the idea of a \ngathering of anti-war socialists of all nations was born. The \nInternational Socialist Bureau's lethargy incensed such socialists. It was \na tiny minority of the German Social-Democratic Party, but a breach \nin the wall of party unity had been made. In June 1915 Liebknecht \ndeepened the rift among German social-democrats by suggesting in \na pamphlet that the party's policy of 'civil peace' (Burgfrieden) for \nthe war's duration ought to be abandoned; he drew support from \ntwelve Reichstag members. 25 \nThe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, the Italian Socialist \nParty and the Balkan Socialist Federation sent official representa-\ntives (although the Russians made their customary insistence on \nsending separate factional representatives); these were necessarily but \na small minority of European socialist organisations. Thus the ascendant leaderships of the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, the French Socialist Party and the British \nLabour Party received no invitation. The comradely spirit between the Bolsheviks and \nthe Polish left-wing social-democrats grew. It called for a break with the official socialist leaderships \nwhich took such a line, and it indicated that Kautsky and the \nGerman 'centrists' were also to be categorised as advocates of social-\nchauvinism. A joint strategy for \nthe Left was thought essential, and Bolsheviks and Polish social-\ndemocrats were past masters of the skills of the organisational \ncabale. \nBerzins from the Leftish social-democrats; T. The contents \ncalled explicitly for civil war and urged socialists not to make a fetish \nout of party unity. \nThere followed a discussion of the German Social-Democratic \nParty's vote for war credits. Condemnation of the German Social-Democratic \nParty's ascendant party leadership in 1914 was common to all at \nZimmerwald; but proposals for action were varied. It recalled the Second \nInternational's decisions on war before 1914 with approval, and \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstated that the official socialist leaderships had failed the European \nworking class. Signs of the break-up of the German Social-\nDemocratic Party had been glimpsed. 51 On the other \nhand, Zinoviev also differed from Lenin in refusing to blame the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party's behaviour overwhelmingly upon \nthe party leadership. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party's \nprogramme and the pre-war decisions of the Bolsheviks were not to \nbe abandoned. But such talk was not peculiar to \nsocialists in wartime. Throughout \nthe war, as before, Lenin assumed Russia to be ripe for revolution; 107 \nand, as Social-Democrat announced in its January 1917 issue: 'The \nrevolution is approaching, the government is preparing itself. Talk of the immediate \ninception of socialism repelled him. Only the accession of 'the party of the proletariat' \ncould change that. He hoped, of course, that some broad \ninfluence would be exerted by Social-Democrat. 160 \nThe authorities had feared lest the link-up between the revolu-\ntionary social-democrats and the striking workers should become \nfirm. Social-Democrat was not meant \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto be a popular workers' paper. 165 Social-Democrat was quick to advertise any support \nfor its policies. Its February 1916 issue reproduced an item from the \nMoscow Committee which incorporated a commitment to the slogan \nof 'civil war'; but the item also indicated continuing resistance to \nLenin's idea that Bolsheviks should work for Russia's defeat.", "Social_Democrats_1910": " The first \nsocialist state had been born. On 13 February 1910, invoking his \nauthority as co-editor of Social-Democrat, he published an article \nironically entitled 'Towards Unity'.21 The endless \ndisputes after the Central Committee plenum of January 1910 \ndemonstrated that a comprehensive examination of the party's \ncondition was necessary. Supported by the \nrepresentatives of both the Polish and Latvian autonomous sections \nof the All-Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, they called for \nthe convocation of a Conference in the near future.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration).' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. 58 \nThe German Social-Democratic Party was the Second Socialist \nInternational's major force.

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 159 \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The \n'August Bloc' in Vienna included a range of Russian social-\ndemocrats, from a pair of Bogdanovists through to a representative \nof the so-called Liquidators. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the Fourth Party Congress in \nApril 1906 an agreement was reached, and the Polish social-\ndemocrats entered the larger party with rights of autonomy in the \nterritory covered by its existing organisations and with automatic \nrepresentation in the central party apparatus. 177 At the Fifth \nCongress in 1907, the Polish social-democrats constituted roughly a \nsixth of the party's entire membership; 178 their radicalism was vital to \nthe success of Bolshevik policies at the Congress. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. 182 The Polish social-democrats, moreover, deftly retained \nthe balance of power in the central party apparatus. Warsaw-based \nsocial-democrats were especially discontented. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. 207 Michels and Weber were \nimpugning the practices and objectives of the German Social-\nDemocratic Party. The young Bolshevik, V.", "Social_Democrats_1917": " The great question of coalition with \ncompeting socialist parties was unanswered. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies continued to attend the sessions of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, badgering the \nCouncil of People's Commissars with criticisms of its officials' \nconduct. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries retained an all-\nsocialist coalition as their ideal objective. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. '35 Local Bolsheviks \nwere simply implored to make their own political arrangements and \nkeep an eye on the central party newspaper for general guidance. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. In the meantime, on 2 \nNovember, a Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia \nwas accepted by Sovnarkom and issued next day under the signature \nof Stalin and Lenin; it called for 'a voluntary and honourable union of \nthe peoples of Russia', abolishing all previous national privileges and \nother discriminations and confirming the right of each nation to \nsecession. 58 \nThe policy was fraught with an unanticipated difficulty: the \nFinnish social-democrats, whose left wing under Karl Wiik had \nbeen expected by Lenin to install a socialist government, failed to \ncome to power. Lenin's letters to Finnish social-democrats before the \nOctober Revolution reveal how badly he misjudged the socialists of \nFinland even though he had spent the summer among them. 59 The \nFinnish social-democrats were reluctant to budge even after the \nOctober events in Petrograd.61 Without becoming the party of government, moreover, \nthe Finnish social-democrats were in no position to declare their \ncountry's independence: the summer's elections had produced a \nconservative administration in Helsinki under P. Lenin and \nStalin continued to goad the Finnish social-democrats into a seizure \nof power after December. No Bolshevik leader yet approved \nthe principles of federalism. Nor did \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBukharin and the Bolshevik left have a practical alternative. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks. He had \nurged the need for a system of civil rights and judicial procedures \nwhich expressly discriminated against the bourgeoisie; and he had \ndescribed all parties to the right of the Bolsheviks as mere \nappendages of the Kadets and their pro-bourgeois interests.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. 87 \nAdmittedly, the Bolshevik Central Committee and Sovnarkom \nwere not hallucinating when they talked of enemies who planned or \ncould reasonably be expected to plan armed opposition towards the \nBolsheviks. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety.92 But by 28 November this inhibition had \ndisappeared: Lenin signed a Sovnarkom announcement that all \nmembers of the Kadet party, regardless of their opinions and \nactivity as individuals, were to be treated as 'enemies of the people' \nand placed outside the law. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. Joffe, who resembled Trotski \ninasmuch as he was a left-wing Marxist who had joined the \nBolshevik party only in 1917. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to a man and \nwoman, were implacably opposed to a separate peace. The central party leadership was a collective of \nMarxist believers. 123 Poor Lenin. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. 128 \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe revolutionary elan persisted. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice.", "Social_Democrats_1913": " Workers' Newspaper was \nissued only twice in 1912; publication of Social Democrat conti-\nnued, but less frequently than before. Only three issues appeared in \n1913. Furthermore, the illegal party apparatus was in no better \nshape than before 1912. But his \ncontention was that, for years ahead, social-democrats would have \nto take account of nationalism as an important political factor.67 The Jewish Bund in the Russian Social-Democratic \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLabour Party had always Ieant in this direction and successfully \nadvocated it in Vienna in August 1912.68 The Polish social-democrats \nunder Jogiches and Luxemburg added an economic dimension to the \nfeeling that multinational states should be maintained. 114 \nThe Bolshevik I. 174 In December 1913, Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. Since July 1913 he and the Central Committee had been \ntalking about holding a Party Congress. 184 This was another device \nto arrogate legitimacy for the Bolsheviks as the principal constituent \nmembers of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Much was also made about the election of Bolshevik \nactivists to trade union boards. The International \nSocialist Bureau's December 1913 decision to invite all factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party to an 'exchange of views' \nmeeting in Brussels lay on the table.", "Social_Democrats_1914": " It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. 7 Reports from the \nGerman Reichstag told that the social-democrats had voted war \ncredits to their government. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. 10 His \ninclination hardened as it became evident that not only the German \nsocial-democrats but nearly all other socialist parties in Europe \ndeclined to oppose their respective country's entry into the war. Not all socialist groups were swept up \nby the pro-war and patriotic frenzy. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. The working classes of \nEurope had been misled; they had long been 'hostile to opportunism \nand chauvinism', but had been gulled into acquiescing in govern-\nmental policies through the connivance of social-democratic party \nleaderships. Karpinski, to revive Social-Democrat. The first wartime issue of Social-Democrat, no. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia.62 He lashed out at the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, and named names.'64 They too expected the war to induce Europe's long-\nawaited socialist revolution. Both men saw that the popular desire for peace in Europe \nwould strengthen as the rigours of war worsened; and they wanted \nsocial-democrats to join all movements, socialist or not, that \nexpressed this desire. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats. Social-Democrat was designated as the organ of the Central \nCommittee.80 The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before 1914 in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. \nHis commentary on the German Social-Democratic Party, too, was \nunreliable. Maslov, the German \ngovernment could count on most German social-democrats to \napprove of expansionist war policies;83 and his left-wing Menshevik \ncolleague A. 84 Plekhanov highlighted how isolated the \nGerman far-left socialists under Karl Liebknecht were in the Ger-\nman Social-Democratic Party, and he suggested that German \nsocialism's doctrines would quickly be 'revised' in favour of a more \nexplicit nationalism in the event of a German victory in the war.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final.91 Zinoviev alleged that the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party's officials were supported mainly \nby the skilled and better-paid workers, who outnumbered the \nunskilled in the party's ranks. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914. The ascendant \nparty leadership called itself social-democratic.94 The rightward \nshift of the German Social-Democratic party was not imaginary. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. Not only liberal but also \nsocialist politicians exploited the committees for their own ends.97 Shlyapnikov also spoke at the \nCongress of Swedish social--democrats in November. There was therefore no longer \nmuch point in Russian social-democrats emphasising the reforms to \nbe demanded when the Romanov autocracy should fall. 107 \nSocial-Democrat's future was secured. The International Socialist \nBureau was virtually inoperative. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present.

The moment for revolt was approaching.35 No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. Revolutions required organisa-\ntion. \nAs soon as published, Lenin's words attracted a familiar accusation: \npopulism.3s Lenin's \nreply was caustic. The Russian \nbourgeoisie lacked not only the political will to destroy the autocracy \nbut also the social and economic power necessary for the governance \nof Russian society once the popular insurrection had occurred. It \nwould therefore fall to the Russian working class to carry out the \ndemocratic reforms vital to the reconstruction of state and society: \nworkers would carry through the democratic revolution. Did not their plans \ncontradict the Russian Marxist prognostication that a socialist revolu-\ntion could occur in any country only after a lengthy epoch of \ngovernment by the bourgeoisie. Was it not true that Russia's cultural and \neconomic level of development was too primitive to permit the \nimmediate transition to socialism. Instead he called for 'permanent revolution' .44 He scrapped \nthe timetable which prescribed separate epochs for the democratic and \nsocialist revolutions. Firstly, his \ngovernment would not try to introduce socialism overnight. It would \npreside over a period of capitalist economic development. Secondly, \nhe predicted that social-democrats would swiftly be ejected from \npower unless fraternal socialist revolutions occurred in the more \nmature industrial societies of Europe. \nIn fact, Marx himself in 1850 had used terminology remarkably like \nTrotski's; and he too had spoken against treating the bourgeois and \nsocialist revolutions as distinct phases. The Russian Marxist notion of the \ntwo-stage transition to socialism was not yet jettisoned. Lenin \nnonetheless argued that socialists should constitute the first temporary \ngovernment after the absolute monarchy's removal. Allying with the Party Of \nSocialist-Revolutionaries, they should aim to form a 'provisional \nrevolutionary government'. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party.51 \nLenin emphasised that his provisional revolutionary government \nwould not be introducing socialism. In his opinion, indeed, the reforms \nwould foster the maturation of a capitalist economy. Russia was not yet \nripe for socialist revolution; and the socialist coalition presumably \nwould eventually lose power to other political parties as economic \nmodernisation was realised. \nHe and the Mensheviks referred Lenin to the decision of the Second \nInternational, taken in 1904, forbidding socialist parties to enter \ncoalition governments. The Second \nInternational's intention had been to prohibit socialists from forming \ncoalitions which would prop up a capitalist order in advanced \nindustrial countries. Lenin's revolu-\ntionary dictatorship, unbridled by legal constraints, would quickly \nbecome oppressive. The rural population would not voluntarily accept Bolshevik \nagrarian policy; and immense discontent would occur if the socialist \ncoalition was determined to carry out its policies. In 1905, Lenin observed the countryside'S \nferment. The \npolitical framework envisaged by Lenin in 1905 was destined never to \ncome into existence in precisely the shape described by him. The \nOctober Revolution of 1917 gave rise to policies which differed \nimportantly from Lenin's earlier projections. \nThe Bolshevik government encountered stiff resistance when it \nintervened directly and heavily in the operations of the peasant \neconomy: the New Economic Policy of 1921 was a recognition by the \ngovernment that the peasants were intent upon ordering their \neconomic life as they saw fit. Lenin's writings in 1905 overestimated \nthe Russian peasantry's predisposition to welcome policies designed to \neffect rapid modernisation of agriculture. Probably his proposals of 1905, if modified so \nas to avoid peasant revolts, provided greater chance of success in \nstimulating change than Maslov's.6s Yet Krasin was not the \nonly delegate to express doubt that Russian workers acknowledged the \nnecessity of political revolution.6s Lenin was content. Lenin went further. And indeed there was something akin to \nanticipatory relish in Lenin's further statement that the revolutionary \ndictatorship of the workers and the peasantry in Russia should \norganise its own terror. The Lenin-Krasin resolution won a massive majority. \nVladimirov enquired where the party should in fact stop with its \nagrarian reforms.' was Lenin's response.86 Not for the \nonly time in 1905 the urge to move towards Trotski's 'permanent \nrevolution' showed itself in Lenin's reflex reactions. He objected to the growth of a cult around Lenin, \ndeclaring: 'I am not a Leninist, I'm a party activist, a revolutionary \nsocial-democrat, a Marxist. \nAUTOCRACY IN RETREAT \nThird Congress delegates, when proceedings ended on 27 April 1905, \nfelt sure that political unrest in Russia was about to increase in \nseverity; the debates had put Lenin in closer touch with his native land, \nif only through the medium of activists who had journeyed thence to \nLondon. The Bolsheviks wanted insurrection. On 17 October 1905 \nhe issued a further Manifesto.", "Socialist_Revolutions_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. \nHaving defeated the bourgeoisie by force of arms after the October \nRevolution, they were deeply annoyed that capitalist tendencies would \nrise up again in peacetime. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. The \nBolshevik party's fear of kulak-led resistance to its authority was so \nstrong that even the Ukrainian equivalent of the committees of the \nvillage poor, abolished in Russia in December 1918, remained in \nexistence until the mid-1920s.27 The reform was \ntherefore still a tremendous gamble by Lenin; it might cause more \nproblems than it solved. His first plan for the speech to \nthe Party Congress on agrarian reform in March 1921 assumed that a \n'peasant counter-revolution' was occurring against Bolshevism.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved. In this tense situation no \nquarter would be offered to the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolution-\naries. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party. In 1920 he had underestimated the nationalism of the \nPoles. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism. 64 \nThe Politburo was perplexed as to how to develop a line which \nwould simultaneously enhance territorial security, facilitate the spread \nof socialist revolutions and attract investment from foreign capitalists.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921.70 \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n197 \nThis emphasis was strengthened by the failure of the 'March Action' \nundertaken by the German Communist Party, on the initiative of Bela \nKun and other representatives of the Communist International, to \noverthrow the elected German government and seize power in the last \nweek of March 1921. By his own estimation, socialist revolution in \nGermany was a prerequisite for the full achievement of socialism in \nRussia. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. \nYet the central party leaders were also exercised by Marxist theory; \nthe question arose about the prospects for international capitalism if \nthere might be no European socialist revolution for several years. \nAbout the inevitability of such a revolution there was no disagreement. His \npamphlet On The Food Tax and his subsequent speeches to the Tenth \nParty Conference, in May 1921, concentrated on domestic economics \nand politics at the expense of the international situation except insofar \nas he mentioned concessionaires. The evidence about the prospects of \nthe major capitalist powers was patchy and ambiguous.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Toning down \nTrotski's presentation, Lenin at the Ninth Congress of Soviets \ncharacterised capitalism with the followint words: 'What has been \nachieved is a certain fragile equilibrium'. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement. No such \nthought crossed Lenin's mind or left his lips even though he \nincreasingly behaved as if 'European socialist revolution' was not \nimmediately in prospect. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore. \nReferring to his disputes with the Left Communists, he dedicated \nover a quarter of the pamphlet to word-for-word quotations from his \n1918 pamphlet On 'Left-Wing' Infantilism and on Petit-Bourgeois \nTendencies. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. State capitalism by contrast was amenable to \nregistration and direction.99 Large-scale \neconomic organisation and up-to-date technology were prerequisites \nfor the building of socialism. After the October \nRevolution he had retained and strengthened the state grain-trade \nmonopoly; in spring 1921 he was insisting on its abolition. \nSeveral measures could in fact be traced back to the October \nRevolution. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. 102 This was poor history, cunning politics. In \nLenin's presentation, the end to grain requisitioning would eventually \nfacilitate the inauguration of 'correct socialist product-exchange'. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. In 1921 he proposed that even a \n'direct transition from patriarchalism to socialism' was not impossible.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable. Consequently they were a means of accelerating the \n'transition to socialism'.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. Progress might be impeded, and it remained \nLenin's contention that it would take decades before socialism could be \nattained in Russia. A foreshortening of the possible time-scale was \nconceivable only if socialist revolutions broke out beforehand in \ncountries like 'England, Germany, America'. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. He entirely omitted to explain how state capitalism would be \nturned into socialism. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. Lenin in previous works had \ndescribed the peasantry as a feudal class in an advanced stage of \ndisintegration, under the impact of capitalist economic development, \ninto two antagonistic new classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; \nhe had also stressed in the Party Programme that the party should \nenhance the interests of the poorer and middling segments of the \npeasantry.135 Now that Lenin's own proposed ideas, theses and booklet \nwere being savaged, Larin remarked: 'At this moment, comrades, I \nwould remind comrade Lenin that writing theses is a rottenjobl' 136 His \nsubstantive contention was that the New Economic Policy should give \ngreater attention to large-scale industry and the plight of the urban \nworking class.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 50 \nNonetheless Lenin had indisputably carried a greater load than the \nrest, and the load involved a concatenation of crises in the economy, \nadministration, politics, security and foreign policy. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it. Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. \nHe was exercised by the possibilities of socialist revolutions in Europe. \nAlready, as he admitted, there were controversies among Politburo \nmembers as to whether the Communist International confronted a \nperiod of 'quiescence' when the capitalist economies would stabilise \nthemselves and prevent revolutionary conturbation. 155 Conse-\nquently revolutions might not long be delayed. Trouble looked as if \nit would arise when a perceptive delegate shouted out that a \ndiscrepancy existed between the respective assumptions about the \nprospects of European socialist revolution displayed by Radek and \nLenin. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. 163 \nFor the moment the Bolsheviks had to elaborate their measures on \nthe premise that the October Revolution stood alone. In March 1922 \nPreobrazhenski summarised his objections in a set of theses which \nindicated 'a tendency towards collapse' in the economy of the poor \nsections of the peasantry. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. Even as Lenin had been \ninitiating discussions on agrarian reform in February 1921, he was \nchairing Sovnarkom sessions which required Gosplan to draw up a \nsingle comprehensive plan for all sectors of the economy. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed.

Noskov's Bolshevik Conciliators would \ninsist that Mensheviks be allowed to be elected as Congress delegates.21 To Lenin's way of thinking, Menshevism was a \ncancer in the body pf the party: it had to be cut out immediately. \nLenin's one-mad proclamation of the parting of the ways was saluted \nby a number of Bolsheviks in Geneva and Zurich. Petersburg in December 1904. 24 Lenin \nreplied on 29 January 1905.'26 This \nwas wartime, Lenin declared. Half-heartedness and pessimism were \ndangerous to the party's interest; Lenin urged that social-democrats \nspreading despondency should be 'shot on the spot'.29 Lenin \nwould at last get his Congress. \nNot for the last time, his colleagues wrongly inferred that they had put \nan end to Lenin's disruptions. He genuinely believed, in so far as his inner \ncalculations may be assessed, that Menshevik strategy as it was \nevolving in the winter of 1904--5 constituted a menace to the prospects \nof successful revolution; he was therefore equally intent upon breaking \nwith any Bolsheviks like Noskov who refused to engage in uncondi-\ntional struggle with the Menshevik leaders. The point to be made is not \nthat Lenin was being fundamentally insincere. He failed to perceive the harm he \nmight be doing to the chances of amicable co-operation among \nBolsheviks of all shades; and this was all the more regrettable a failure \nsince he himself recognised that revolution was impossible without a \nlarge corps of experienced, militant activists.31 He also made it harder \nfor Mensheviks to come over to the Bolshevik side. Lenin's intemperate mode of behaviour \nharmed his own cause.33 \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'TWO TACTICS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY IN THE \nDEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION' \nEvidence for the authenticity of his belief in the imminence of \nrevolutionary upheaval is found in his theoretical writings. He had it quickly published \nand transported clandestinely to Russia; and the rapid approval of its \nstrategical outline by virtually every Bolshevik demonstrates his \ncontinuing popularity as a theorist even at a time when his prestige as a \npractical leader was entering a partial eclipse.35 No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. \nAs soon as published, Lenin's words attracted a familiar accusation: \npopulism.3s Lenin's \nreply was caustic. The Russian \nbourgeoisie lacked not only the political will to destroy the autocracy \nbut also the social and economic power necessary for the governance \nof Russian society once the popular insurrection had occurred. It \nwould therefore fall to the Russian working class to carry out the \ndemocratic reforms vital to the reconstruction of state and society: \nworkers would carry through the democratic revolution. Did not their plans \ncontradict the Russian Marxist prognostication that a socialist revolu-\ntion could occur in any country only after a lengthy epoch of \ngovernment by the bourgeoisie. Immediately he was accused of offering a \n 130 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndisguised version of populism.45 \nThe webs spun by Parvus and Trotski momentarily encoiled Lenin.47 Lenin assured his follow-\ners: 'We shall not stop halfway.5o Lenin exhibited no knowledge \nof this. The Russian Marxist notion of the \ntwo-stage transition to socialism was not yet jettisoned. Lenin maintained that, if the revolutionary \npotentiality of the peasants was to be realised, their political \nrepresentatives had to obtain a share in power. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party.51 \nLenin emphasised that his provisional revolutionary government \nwould not be introducing socialism. Russia was not yet \nripe for socialist revolution; and the socialist coalition presumably \nwould eventually lose power to other political parties as economic \nmodernisation was realised. \nHe and the Mensheviks referred Lenin to the decision of the Second \nInternational, taken in 1904, forbidding socialist parties to enter \ncoalition governments.54 Lenin had his reply to hand. Lenin's revolu-\ntionary dictatorship, unbridled by legal constraints, would quickly \nbecome oppressive. The rural population would not voluntarily accept Bolshevik \nagrarian policy; and immense discontent would occur if the socialist \ncoalition was determined to carry out its policies.57 \nLenin had hoped to pre-empt such criticisms by enlarging the \nenticements to the peasantry in the party programme. In 1905, Lenin observed the countryside'S \nferment.58 And yet, far from reassuring the \nMensheviks, Lenin's proposals alarmed them.59 Lenin argued that he had been \nmisunderstood. Under such a regime, asked Lenin, where \nwould counterrevolutionaries get the necessary backing to form an \narmy to destroy the democratic institutions created by the provisional \nrevolutionary government. It is difficult to judge who was more right, Lenin or \nMaslov. The \npolitical framework envisaged by Lenin in 1905 was destined never to \ncome into existence in precisely the shape described by him. The \nOctober Revolution of 1917 gave rise to policies which differed \nimportantly from Lenin's earlier projections. But Soviet rural history \nstill offers clues for the adjudication of the Lenin-Maslov controversy. \nThe Bolshevik government encountered stiff resistance when it \nintervened directly and heavily in the operations of the peasant \neconomy: the New Economic Policy of 1921 was a recognition by the \ngovernment that the peasants were intent upon ordering their \neconomic life as they saw fit. Lenin's writings in 1905 overestimated \nthe Russian peasantry's predisposition to welcome policies designed to \neffect rapid modernisation of agriculture. \nThe arrangements for the Congress were out of Lenin's hands. He steered the Congress away \nfrom allowing representation to Bolshevik splinter groups in cities \nwhere the legitimately-constituted committees favoured the Men-\nsheviks. \nKrasin's conciliationism attracted many delegates; and Bogdanov won \nfavour from others on questions which found him at odds with Lenin. \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's mood, however, was buoyed up by the early broadly-based \nsupport he obtained for his call for a strategic offensive.6s Yet Krasin was not the \nonly delegate to express doubt that Russian workers acknowledged the \nnecessity of political revolution. Lenin found this acceptable: he and his \nassociates agreed to modify the motion.6s Lenin was content.70 Lenin sided with Rumyantsev. Lenin wanted the party to start \nforming trade unions. Rumyantsev was unpersuaded; he retained that \nwidespread Bolshevik distaste for activity that appeared directed \ntowards non-political ends.72 The \nCongress's drafting commission overruled Lenin. Tskhakaya, in particular, contended \nthat the Russia of mid-1905 differed little from the Russia of 1902.7s At all events the \ndiscussion had shown how far removed was Lenin from seeking the \neternal application of What Is To Be Done. Marx, according to Plekhanov, would never have espoused \n 'Sturm und Drang' \n135 \nLenin's proposals; and the corroborative evidence was supposedly to \nbe found in articles inveighing against those socialist 'opportunists' \nwho were ready to do a deal with the middle class.7s Lenin rehearsed \nthe case already mounted in reply to Martynov. Bolshevik policy was \ndesigned to prevent, not to engineer a Millerandist sell-out. Lenin went further.78 Lenin drew a veil, presumably consciously, over \nMarx's changeability. And indeed there was something akin to \nanticipatory relish in Lenin's further statement that the revolutionary \ndictatorship of the workers and the peasantry in Russia should \norganise its own terror. It may well be that Lenin was carried \naway in the heat of the moment, and that he revealed a policy which he \notherwise preferred to cosset with euphemisms.81 \nBolsheviks of all complexions anyway warmed to his speech; not a \nsingle delegate rose to oppose him. The Lenin-Krasin resolution won a massive majority. \nLenin defended the formulation loyally at the Congress. \nVladimirov enquired where the party should in fact stop with its \nagrarian reforms.' was Lenin's response.86 Not for the \nonly time in 1905 the urge to move towards Trotski's 'permanent \nrevolution' showed itself in Lenin's reflex reactions.

The Mensheviks collaborated with \nhim willingly, but the Bolsheviks baulked for a time at the Soviet's \ninsistence upon its 'non-party' status.", "Bolsheviks_1907": " \nBe that as it may, the clamour of Russian oppositional groups for \nelective, representative government had never been stronger than in \n1906. 2 There were only seventeen \nrepresentatives from the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, \nand only two from the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. It was disliked by Bolsheviks, including those like Lenin \nwho had been unhappy about boycotting the Duma elections in the \nfirst instance.9 \nMeanwhile the Bolshevik Centre's activity was focused on the \ntowns. The Centre's leading \nfigures were Bogdanov, Krasin and Lenin. But Lenin, unlike Bogdanov \nand Krasin, was unhappy that the Centre should remain involved in the \norganisation of military training; 12 he knew too that his two colleagues \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \nretained objections to official party policy on participation in the \nSecond State Duma. 14 \nOn the other hand it was not in his interest to drive the Mensheviks \nto break with the Bolsheviks. Lenin called for participation. The Mensheviks did Lenin's job for him. Lenin's reaction was the same as \nthat of Bogdanov and Krasin. His momentary thoughts of agreements \nwith representatives of liberalism were a thing of the past; he joined all \nthe other Bolsheviks in an anti-Menshevik front. 1s Bolsheviks, though by \nno means all of them, then campaigned to get social-democrats elected \nto the Duma.16 Party work was conducted cauti-\nously; and the environment of repression began to tip the balance of \nsocial-democratic opinion in the Bolsheviks' favour, however margi-\nnally, after the closure of the First State Duma.17 Bolshevik doubts \nabout the Central Committee's higher hopes about parliamentarism \nseemed justified. And Bolsheviks were among them for the \nfirst time; eighteen of the faction's candidates secured election.21 \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in 1906-7 make a mixed impression. He was \nunmoved by Trotski's Results and Prospects, which was published in \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1906;23 he objected equally to the multi-volume studies on con-\ntemporary Russia produced by the Menshevik leadership from 1909 \nonwards.24 He also rejected the general political scenario painted in \nBogdanov's various works (although it was not until the latter half of \n1907 that Lenin engaged his rival in open disagreement at a Party \nConference). Lenin still defended the \nBolshevik refusal to participate in the First State Duma.29 Lenin's position was 'centrist' \ninside Russian social-democracy on the parliamentary question; he \ndisagreed with both Bogdanov to his 'left' and Martov to his 'right'.30 \nIn fact Bogdanov's views were distorted in Lenin's presentation. The Russian political situation, moreover, was inherently \nunstable.32 In reply, Lenin agreed that politics in Russia were \nsusceptible of sudden transformation; he, no less than Bogdanov, \nexpected violent political 'breaks' and 'leaps' to take place. Bogdanov, in his turn, declared that \nLenin's tactical shimmyings amounted to a sell-out of Bolshevik \nprogrammatic goals to Menshevism.34 Lenin retorted that he was no \nMenshevik. Along with other social-democratic \ntheorists, Lenin had written little specifically about the autocracy. Until 1905 \ntheir main aim had been to demonstrate that, however unmodern its \ngeneral appearance, the Russian economy had decisively embarked \nupon a course of capitalist development. Trotski, like most other social-democratic \nwriters (ranging from Bogdanov on one side through to Martynov and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMaslov on the other), emphasised how little the position of the \nmonarchy had been changed by the post-1905 'constitutional' \nreforms; the political edifice was basically unaltered.3s \nLenin had often in the past referred to the' Asiatism' of Russian \npolitical life, nor did he cease to do so; but he also maintained that the \nRussian state had been greatly altered by 1905.39 This phrase was unacceptable \nto his opponents, Bolshevik and Menshevik. In terms of \nthe long-standing consensus in Russian Marxism, was his standpoint \nnot heresy. Lenin's response drew attention to two matters: German \nhistory and 'Bonapartism'.42 Premier Stoly-\npin, in Lenin's judgement, was introducing such Bonapartism to \nRussia.43 \nLenin's approach shows him not to have been strait-jacketed by the \nprejudices of his colleagues. Virtually all \nMensheviks wanted to do this through the 'municipalisation' of \nproperty in land, most Bolsheviks through letting the peasants seize it \nfor themselves; and Lenin had his own policy of 'nationalisation'.51 \nIf there was going to be such a challenge, Lenin was the likeliest \nperson to make it. At the very best it would require 'decades and decades'; \nand Lenin remained convinced that a revolutionary political crisis \ncould re-emerge at any time. Indeed it was in 1907 that he at last conceded that his early \nwritings had exaggerated the level of Russian capitalist development; \nand that feudalistic practices were stronger than he had once \nimagined. Lenin held \nfast to his original position. And \n For the Good a/the Cause \n165 \nhere we come upon a controversy as unresolved today as it was in the \nlifetime of Lenin and Maslov.65 All \norganised Marxists in the Russian empire were, for the first time, \nrepresented at a Party Congress. The Bolsheviks detected questions of principle in every item \nproposed by their opponents; and they charged them with disregard \nfor the importance of 'theory' . Lenin, through tactical astuteness, got as much as \nhe could reasonably have hoped for.71 Bogdanov too \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvolunteered a report, prompting Martov to surmise that his adver-\nsary's task would be to comment on the work of 'another secret \ninstitution'.72 This was a reference to the Bolshevik Centre. As \nevidence of Bolshevik duplicity, Martov noted that Bogdanov, Krasin \nand Lenin had refused to hand over to the Central Committee the sum \nof 60 000 roubles left to the party in the will of the industrialist Savva \nMorozov. The \nMenshevik Martynov jibed that, while he stood for 'permanent \nrevolution', the Bolsheviks preferred 'permanent chatter'. The Polish, Latvian and \nBundist delegations found the Bolshevik-Menshevik altercations \ntiresome. The Bolsheviks, \nhaving won only a handful of places at the Congress more than the \nMensheviks, did not command an absolute majority. Aleksinski, a deputy in \nthe Duma and also a Bolshevik, delivered a hostile co-report;77 and \nLenin dismissed Tsereteli's words as 'the purest revisionism' . \nPlekhanov stirred up further wrangling when he suggested that the \nphilosophical standpoint of Mach and Avenarius, so beloved of many \nBolsheviks, was irreconcilable with Marxism; he also asserted that \nsyndicalist ideas might soon take hold inside the Bolshevik faction.80 \nAgain the Poles and other non-Russian delegates intervened and the \nCongress was hauled forward to its third item: Lenin's report on the \nparty's 'relation to the bourgois parties' .83 Lenin was accused of using the slogans of the \nnarodniki.84 \nBut the Bolsheviks obtained strong support from the Congress floor.8s \nTrotski, Luxemburg and Jogiches thought Lenin over-optimistic about \nthe scale of potential assistance from the peasantry; but the Bolsheviks \nthis time stood their ground and, after some vacillation, most Poles \nvoted for the Bolshevik motion.87 Thus the Bolsheviks recorded their \nfirst unqualified victory at the Congress.ss Speaking for the \nBolsheviks, G.s9 \nThe Mensheviks knew that the Bolsheviks would win the resultant \nvote. Why was \nit, they asked, that the Bolsheviks looked upon workers' soviets as \nnothing better than a 'necessary evil'.90 Neither \nBogdanov nor Lenin responded. Bolshevik opposition to Akselrod's \nscheme earned the Congress's approval.91 Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. On 18 May \nthe Bolsheviks finally won most of the Latvians and the Poles to their \nside. The Latvians insisted that the Bolsheviks make \nexcisions from their motion, especially the clause justifying the boycott \nof the First Duma. Thus modified, the Bolshevik motion was passed by \nCongress.92 \nDan assailed the Bolshevik leaders as wheeler-dealers: 'And it is \nimpossible by your words to paint over the fact that you were against \nparticipation in the State Duma, and now you're sitting in it' .93 On all \nsides he saw signs of Bolshevik trickery.94 The Bolsheviks \nhad ignored the Fourth Congress's prohibition on bank-raids; and the \nFifth Congress reprimanded them for it. It had been in \nnear-panic that the delegates attended to three final crucial items of \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness before returning to Russia. They were presented with a joint \nmotion on the trade unions by the Bolsheviks, the Poles and the \nLatvians. Five were Bolsheviks: I. \nRozhkov, I.1Oo The Poles \nwould be useful allies for the Bolsheviks on many issues. It was already crystal-clear that the Bolshevik faction \nwould not be able to do just as it liked in the Central Committee, no \nmore than it had in the stormy proceedings of the Congress. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party mustered \nonly nineteen places. l03 \nMost Bolshevik leaders had called for a boycott, pressing their case \nat an emergency Party Conference in the Finnish town of Kotka on 21 \nJuly. Lenin therefore held the ring between Bogdanov and Dan. Bogdanov \nhad his reservations about Lenin's motion recorded for dissemination \nto the party at large, but in the end he voted for it as a lesser evil than \nthe project of the Mensheviks. l07 \nLenin's 'centrist' resolution was victorious at the Party Conference. Repression increased after \nJune 1907.109 The police hunted down revolutionary parties. \nAccording to Trotski's estimate, the Russian Social Democratic \nLabour Party's membership dropped from 150 000 in 1907 to 10 000 \nin 1910. \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased. By late 1907, repression had pacified the countryside and he \nanticipated years when the 'sober and strong' among the peasants \nwould quit the commune and become solid, prosperous supporters of \nthe social order. Throughout 1906, Lenin had \navoided exposing himself to the danger of arrest;123 and his caution was \nstrengthened when the Second Duma was suspended in June 1907.125 The Bolshevik \nCentre recognised, even in 1906, the importance of acquiring a safe, \nsecret base.126 There Lenin lived \nwith Bogdanov and Krasin, and the troika had Krupskaya as their \nsecretary.129 While in Finland, Lenin lived under \nthe pseudonym of Ervin Veikov. \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nA contract was signed for a multi-volume edition of his works, to be \nentitled Over the Past Twelve Years .137 His intransigence was \nnot unique among Bolsheviks. But this only encour-\naged the Bolshevik Centre to persist in its kind of behaviour. The \nBolshevik leaders by contrast revelled in a machismo of personal \ninsensitivity in debate. 'I \nheard Lenin', wrote a girl about a conference of St. He fretted about the Central Com-\nmittee and the Bolshevik Centre's far from secure grasp on it. Even \nsharper was his concern about Bogdanov's influence in the Bolshevik \nCentre. Lenin's anti-Kadet \nmotion won the day.142 Yet it did not reflect the attitude of all \nBolsheviks; and many boycottists, having failed to prevent the party's \nelectoral participation, soon began to think of ways to stop the \nBolshevik Duma deputies from attending the Duma. A split between \nLenin and Bogdanov was in the making. The Bolsheviks were a mere faction. \nHow could Lenin justify cleaving them into two mini-factions. Lenin declared: 'Indi-\nvidual parties can hide in the underground, give no sign of themselves, \ndisappear from the political centre-stage; but, at the slightest revivifi-\ncation, the basic political forces will again reveal themselves, perhaps \nin altered form but with the same character and direction of activity, \nuntil the objective problems of a revolution which has suffered this or \nthat defeat have been resolved.' 144 \nSuch thoughts yielded the conclusion that revolutionary leadership \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin times of unfreedom was better undertaken by a few men with correct \ntheory than by many who united around a hotchpotch of incorrect \nideas. In 1907 Lenin was not ready to break with Bogdanov. Taratuta, Lenin's \nsupporter in the Central Committee, inherited a vast sum of money. Petersburg authorities were given \nclues about Lenin's whereabouts by police agents in Paris. A watch \nwas placed on Lenin's movements on 14 November. Official orders \nwere given to suspend publication of his collected works, and it looked \nmost unlikely that the Bolsheviks would succeed in putting out a party \nnewspaper legally. Lenin became a fugitive. On 12 December 1907 Lenin \njoined the steamer bound for Stockholm; on 21 December, joined at \nlast by Krupskaya, he left Sweden for his second period of emigration \nin Western Europe.", "Bolsheviks_1917": " 5 Unsealed Messages: 1916 \nto April 1917 \nTHE RUSSIAN EMPIRE ON THE BRINK \nPopular uprisings are often described in volcanic imagery: the \nstorming of the Bastille in 1789 grips the imagination two centuries \nlater; the anti-Soviet revolt in Hungary in 1956 comes to us in \npictures of uncontrolled mass fury on Budapest streets. The February \nRevolution of 1917 in Petrograd is no exception. The terms \nused betray the prejudices of the commentators (and these include \nLenin and other leading Bolsheviks). \nFurthermore, although the party activists were few in Petrograd in \nFebruary 1917, there were enough to give guidance to an uprising \nonce the chance to overthrow the autocracy had become fully \nevident. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were \noperating in the suburbs. It is a remarkable \nfact that in 1915-16, except for commentary on disputes among \nsocialists in Petrograd, he wrote only one article specifically about \ngeneral politics in the Russian empire - and a short article at that;3 \nand he overlooked the provinces altogether.9 \nLenin's absorption in mid-European affair:: was not wholly \nvoluntary. Nor could the Foreign Bureau of \nthe Central Committee obtain data through Bolsheviks arriving in \nSwitzerland from Russia. The \nnewcomers were not Bolsheviks but a pair of ordinary conscripts \nwho had escaped from German captivity. 12 \nSo Russian political emigrants in Switzerland had greater excuse \nthan most in failing to perceive in early 1917 that the ultimate crisis \nfor the Romanov monarchy was maturing fast. Strikes swept over Russia in the winter of \n1915-16 and again in late 1916. The huge industrial expansion \n(and Lenin, when in 1917 he was to take a closer interest in wartime \neconomic processes, was virtually alone in emphasising that an \nexpansion of output in factories and mines had occurred) 16 was \naccompanied by problems.5 million workers by January 1917. \n 132 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe moderate conservatives and liberals in the Fourth State Duma \nsaw the need to contact the working class through war-industry \ncommittees which were constituted by both industrialists and work-\ners. In the winter of 1916-1917 the equally \nexasperated Octobrist leader Guchkov took discreet soundings \namong the generals about their attitude to a potential coup against \nthe emperor. The war-industry \ncommittees, despite being shunned by Bolsheviks on the grounds that \nthey were merely a means for prosecuting an imperialist war more \nsuccessfully, allowed the Mensheviks to organise covert anti-regime \npropaganda. Bolsheviks no longer had seats in the Duma; all their \ndeputies languished in Siberian exile. \nTHE KIENTHAL CONFERENCE \nLenin's considerations on Russia at war skirted developments on the \nEastern front. 20 \nIt took the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916 before Lenin began to pay \nclose attention to the Irish factor in British politics, and a mini-\npolemic occurred with Radek (who, true to his anti-nationalist \nstandpoint, refused to greet the insurrection with acclaim). 21 But \nLenin's day-to-day preoccupation was not so much with general \npolitics and social life as with the factional strife among Europe's \nsocialists after the Zimmerwald Conference of September 1915. Zinoviev, the Bolshevik \nrepresentative on the International Socialist Commission established \nat Zimmerwald, constantly expressed reservations about Grimm's \ncentrist motivations. Liebknecht and Luxemburg, along with Lenin, \ncalled unequivocally for a campaign of opposition to the govern-\nment. This was yet another reason why Lenin detested \nKautsky.27 Lenin and Zinoviev, \ndelighted by the snubbing of Grimm, aggravated the situation by \nintroducing intra-Russian disputes on to the Conference floor. The \nmandate of Martov and Akselrod to represent any Russian group \nwas, as usual, challenged by the Bolsheviks. Radek stood up to present a rival project, \ncobbled together by Russian Bolsheviks, the Polish left socialists \nand the German social-democrats from Bremen. Lenin passed a note back to him stating yet again that only \npolitical revolution would suffice to terminate the war. Martov \ndeclared that, if there was a problem in inter-socialist relations, then \nthe Bolsheviks had helped to cause it.44 Lenin retreated into the \nbackground, resuming an angelic silence.55 \nUntil January 1917, Lenin did not ponder exactly how the \ninception of socialism, wherever it took place, would be under-\ntaken; the future dictatorship of the proletariat lay undefined. Largely neglecting Clausewitz's discussion of the \nvariegated aspects of warfare, Lenin underscored the sections \nderiding the pretensions of generals.57 For the Bolshevik leader, it \nwas Clausewitz's description of the organisational simplifications \nbrought about by modern technology that were impressive (as well as \nhis sangfroid about war and death). 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. Profits still \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \naccrued to large private enterprises in particular. In January and February 1917 Lenin took his own notes \non Marxism and the state.65 Lenin \ndesired the textual security of support from Marxism's co-founders. 74 Lenin, on his side, \nurged the need for proletarian dictatorship. 76 Lenin called for an innovation of cardinal \nstrategical significance: that the dictatorship of the proletariat should \nbe constructed on the institutional basis of the soviets. In January \nand February 1917 he went further: the workers' soviets were not \nmerely to bring down the Russian monarchy and establish a \ndemocratic political framework for capitalism, they were also to \ninitiate the entire transition to socialism. 78 \nAs to the functions of such soviets, he was less concerned to \ninvestigate how they had actually operated in 1905 than to indicate \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhow they might operate in the future. Only the news of events back in Russia in February 1917 \ninterrupted the writing up of his materials. Lenin's notes, moreover, took it for granted that capitalist \nsociety is neatly divided into two contending classes, the proletariat \nand the bourgeoisie. \nTHE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION \nAbruptly, from the beginning of March 1917, Lenin was forced to \ntake greater account of developments in current politics in Russia. \nOn 23 February 1917, International Women's Day, women textile \nworkers went on strike in Petrograd. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. Lenin's contemptuous \ndismissal of Russian liberalism as the fifth wheel on the carriage of \ntsarism was harsh but, at such a time of crisis, not wide of the mark. The Petrograd Soviet, \nmoreover, had a Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary majority \nfavouring the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a \n'bourgeois' government drawn from the Duma leadership. \n Unsealed Messages \n145 \nThe emigre revolutionaries perforce relied mainly on non-Russian \nsources of information. The Bolshevik \nleader's continuing preoccupation was with socialist polemics in \nEurope, and he noted trenchantly: 'There is nothing coming from \nRussia, not even letters.89 \nThe Russian emigration was ecstatic. There were celebratory \nembraces and evening-parties, congratulatory messages to the \nnewspapers; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nproclaimed that a millstone had been removed from the shoulders of \nthe people of Russia and her subject territories. Lenin shared in the \ncheer without Jetting himself be carried away.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government.95 This constituted a \nrupture with the old Bolshevik programme. Bolsheviks in 1905 called \nfor a coalition of socialist parties representing all the workers and all \nthe peasants. \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'A workers' government' had figured prominently as an objective \nin Trotski's writings, which Lenin had previously rejected. But it has lain \nunobserved that Lenin's phraseology about the poorest peasants was \nlike that of Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg.97 At any rate, he had severely \ndistorted the conventional Russian Marxist two-stage revolutionary \nschedule. In a telegram to Bolsheviks leaving Scandi-\nnavia for Russia, also on 4 March, he restricted his recommenda-\ntions: no support for the Provisional Government; suspicion of \nKerenski; the arming of the proletariat; elections to the Petrograd \nmunicipal council; and no rapprochement with other parties. The Provisional \nGovernment had to act circumspectly since the Soviet's Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaders had been elected by workers and \nsoldiers who had overthrown the monarchy. 103 Bolsheviks in Petrograd \nat the time of the February Revolution independently felt a similar \ndistaste. The Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, meeting on \n28 February under Shlyapnikov's guidance, called for the formation \nof a provisional revolutionary government of socialists, in line with \ntraditional Bolshevism. But the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary \nacceptance of the Provisional Government prevented the Bureau's \naims from being realised; and the Bolshevik City Committee, too, \nopposed the Bureau. 106 Allies for Lenin were coming into \nexistence without either the allies or Lenin being conscious of such an \nalliance. Disputes \nbetween Pravda and the Russian Bureau persisted through March \n1917. 109 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin rued the absence of rapid communication between Petrograd \nand Switzerland. 111 But his most \nsignificant request was for the Bolsheviks to move from 'the first \nto the second stage of the revolution'. Did he mean a \nsocialist revolution or didn't he. 114 The third \n'Letter from Afar', composed on 11 March, showed signs of \nawareness of the transformation wrought by such ideas in the \ngenerally accepted concept of Bolshevik strategy. Such a revolu-\ntion, Lenin claimed, would not be decreeing socialism or even \ninaugurating the dictatorship of the proletariat. 115 The next day, in the fourth 'Letter', \nLenin stopped talking of the militia and said instead that 'an All-\nRussian Soviet (or a Petersburg Soviet temporarily acting as its \nsubstitute)' should take power. 116 But if the future socialist state was \nnot the dictatorship of the proletariat but a peculiar Russian hybrid \nform, what were the measures to be enacted. 118 The last four 'Letters' \nremained unpublished until after Lenin's death. Lenin's perennial adversary, A. Semovski, another old \nfoe since their entanglement over the national question before the \nwar, stated that the scheme for a workers-and-peasants dictatorship \nappeared to intimate a coalition of Kerenski and Lenin. 123 The construction of the \nanti-Lenin Marxist case in 1917 had begun. Plekhanov, sailing to \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSweden, took a train through to Petrograd in the company of British \nsocialist Will O'Grady and was feted in a hero's welcome in \nPetrograd. He cursed his decision to sit out the war in Switzerland \nand not to join other Bolsheviks in Scandinavia. Lenin fantasised about crossing Germany unrecognised by \ndonning a wig and using V. \nKrupskaya, more amused than horrified, dissuaded Lenin by \npointing out that he would give himself away by muttering \ncomplaints in his sleep about Mensheviks. Russian Foreign Mini-\nster Pavel Milyukov did not yearn to greet politicians struggling \nagainst his government's policies and even, in Lenin's case, working \nfor its overthrow. Lenin sent \ninvitations to fellow socialists to join him. The final number of passengers was \nthirty-two, and twenty of them were Bolsheviks139 Krupskaya talked \nof coming later so that she could wind up factional and personal \nbusiness; but Lenin would not hear of this. They packed three large \nsuitcases and a primus stove to cook for themselves on the train and \nthe two of them bustled about so much in the last days 140 that Lenin \nhad no time to finish the fifth and last of his 'Letters from Afar'. Lenin was mindful of the European political perspec-\ntive and read out a 'Farewell Letter to Swiss Workers'. Lenin edged back towards a wall and the other Bolshevik \nmen stood protectively in front of their leader. Despite the \nlimitation on space, Lenin and Krupskaya were given a compartment \nto themselves by their comrades. Lenin went on filling his notebooks. Janson sought a \nmeeting with Lenin. The request was turned down by Lenin, who \nthreatened to beat him up if he came on board. 149 Tiffs among the \nRussians persisted. Lenin received an invitation from Alexander Parvus-\n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHelphand, a member of the German Social-Democratic Party who \ncarried out missions for the German government with funds to \ndisburse to Russian revolutionaries whose activity might destabilise \nthe Russian government, to meet for discussions. Lenin declined. Radek was disconcerted by the thought of the \nleader of emigre Bolsheviks returning to Petrograd in a pair of \nhobnailed mountain boots, so a reluctant Lenin agreed to buy new \nfootwear. 156 It was \nat Tornio, too, that he obtained copies of the new central Bolshevik \nnewspaper Pravda; 157 and, in the dimly-lit customs hall, he found \nhimself a quiet corner to read them while Zinoviev busied himself \nwith practical arrangements for the journey. Central \nCommittee member Kamenev and other Bolsheviks had journeyed \nout to meet them. Each party or faction tried to outdo the rest in turning \nout a large gathering of supporters; but the co-operation among the \ncapital's socialists in March 1917 meant that most receptions became \nan opportunity for general festivities. Lenin, with a deliberate snub, \nmade no reply but announced the need for 'worldwide socialist \nrevolution'. He did this from on top of an \narmoured car requisitioned by the Petrograd Bolsheviks. His tirade \nagainst the capitalist order in Russia and abroad was fiercer than \nminutes earlier. The challenge to the Provisional Government and to \nits conditional supporters among the ranks of socialism, including \nmany Bolsheviks, was posed on the streets of the capital. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. The kindest interpretation, never offered by Lenin, is that \nThe April Theses were essentially a reproduction of the notebooks on \n'Marxism on the State'. 163 Lenin had begun, in the winter of 1916-\n17, to perceive Russia as being characterised by aspects of 'state \ncapitalism'; 164 but these were preliminary musings. In fact the \nolder Bolshevik strategy had never been a clear two-stage revolu-\ntionary strategy. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 166 \nMoreover, the First World War and its political repercussions \ndominated Lenin's life after 1914, leading him to reject all persons \nand notions which appeared to him to fail to oppose imperialism in a \n Unsealed Messages \n157 \nfundamental fashion. 167 And Lenin in 1917 obviously sensed the \nexistence of a crack in the dam, giving him an opportunity to unleash \nthe flooding waters of history. For example, the fourth thesis \nconceded that 'revolutionary defencism' was sincerely advocated by \na vast number of elected popular representatives in the soviets, and \nthat the Bolsheviks constituted merely a 'pale minority'. 171 Lenin \nalso admitted: 'Russia at the moment is the freest country in the \nworld of all the belligerent countries.' The Bolsheviks should \nconcentrate upon using the new political liberties. 172 Lenin's \nfinessing probably resulted from conversations in Sweden with \nBolsheviks in closer contact with Russian conditions than the \ncorrespondent of Zurcher Post, or from his exchanges with Kame-\nnev at the Finnish frontier. \nAt any rate, Lenin contended flatly that the workers' soviets were \n'the sole possible form of revolutionary government. In \nThesis Six, he advocated land nationalisation (which he had failed to \nhave officially accepted by Bolsheviks in the past). 177 This, \naccording to Lenin's eighth thesis, signified not a scheme for instant \nsocialism but 'a transition immediately only to the control by the \nworkers' soviets over social production and the distribution of \nproducts'.184 (It may be thought that the phrasing betrays a \n Unsealed Messages \n159 \ncertain intellectualist condescension; but Lenin wrote The April \nTheses mainly for the party's leaders, central and local, who used \nsuch terminology regardless as to whether they were of middle-class \nor working-class background. 185 This was scarcely a \nplan of detailed guidance for Bolshevik organisers, but at least it \nadvised what was not to be done. Lenin knew that the April Theses \nwere merely a preliminary sketch. Equally striking \nwas Lenin's silence on the economic and social rights and duties of \nworkers, peasants and soldiers. The \nrelations among the respective soviets of the workers, peasants, \nfarmworkers and soldiers were left unclear. It was also unclear \nwhether the workers' soviets would have powers superior to the \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsoviets of the other social groups. 189 But the skimpiness of theory in The April Theses caused \nLenin himself no embarrassment. The April Theses were the first broad-ranging \nstatement of a fundamental Bolshevik alternative to the policies of \nKamenev and Stalin. Many Bolsheviks agreed on the desirability of \nanother revolution in Russia in the near future; but neither \nShlyapnikov nor any other Bolshevik radical had come forward \nwith quite so broad-ranging a schema. The theses instigated a bitter \ndispute among Bolsheviks, and Lenin had made striking contribution \nto the politics of Bolshevism after the February Revolution. \nApril to July 1917 \nFIGHTING FOR BOLSHEVISM \nThe February Revolution span the kaleidoscope of Russia's politics, \njolting the alliances and rivalries among the parties, and politicians \ngained a freedom of choice unrestricted by the Romanov monarchy. \nLenin's April Theses were the acme of free will. the City Soviet. 10 The Obscene Peace: \nJanuary to March 1918 \nTHE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY \nThe October Revolution's repercussions endure in many forms: the \npolitical map of Europe was lastingly affected. The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. If revolutions failed \nto occur in Europe, the chances of Sovnarkom's survival were \nintimately linked to the question of whether any foreign capitalist \npower had the resources and opportunity to intervene militarily in \nRussia. No Russian army in 1917-18 could have repelled the armed \nmight of either the Germans or the Allies if such might had been \nturned on them in concerted fashion. \nThus the absence of revolutionary explosions in Europe, as Lenin \nwas to concede, 1 meant that his regime's fortunes depended \nultimately on a factor beyond its control: the continued mutual \nexhaustion of the Central Powers and the Allies in the War. \nThe victorious progress of Bolshevism before October 1917 could \nnot permanently obscure these supreme military issues. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nLenin's name had been on several successful lists put forward by \nthe Bolsheviks; and, in accordance with the then current system of \nproportional representation, he chose to be returned as one of the \ndeputies for the Baltic fleet. His manipulativeness and \nlack of public candour was so extreme that, while the Second \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was in \nsession, he implored his Bolshevik Central Committee colleagues to \nannounce a postponement of the Constituent Assembly elections.4 \nThis was a natural corollary of his admission to the Central \nCommittee on 10 October that the Constituent Assembly would \nnot side with the Bolsheviks. Only 168, or 22 per cent, were Bolsheviks; they had suffered a \nmassive defeat. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary.8 And yet no Bolshevik before October is recorded as \nhaving anticipated the scale of the actual defeat. Lenin's worst fears \nduring the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies were fulfilled. \nBolshevik spokesmen argued that the Assembly arrangements had \nbeen unfair to them. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. Lenin and his \nassociates also complained that the lists of electoral candidates had \nbeen drawn up before the split in the Party of Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. Lenin recognised that \ncaution had to be exercised with regard to his own party members \n(who were not universally in favour of the Assembly's suppression), \nto some among his Left Socialist Revolutionary allies and to a \ngeneral population which might not take kindly to the infringement \nof its newly-obtained democratic rights. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. On 12 \nDecember, Lenin successfully called for the reselection of the Bureau \nof the Bolshevik fraction in the Assembly on the grounds that a \nsterner attitude towards the Assembly was appropriate: nothing was \nbeing left to chance. He also met with Bolshevik leaders who had \nreturned from the Ukraine; 14 he spoke on the phone with the \nAmerican Ambassador in Petrograd. 17 Platten, Lenin and Lenin's sister \nMariya got back into their chauffeur-driven car to go to supper in \nthe Smolny Institute. 18 Yet Lenin refused \nto be deflected from his tasks. On 3 \nJanuary 1918 the announcement was made on Sovnarkom's behalf \nthat the Constituent Assembly would be acceptable only if it \nsupported 'soviet power'. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. 22 A demonstration held by supporters \nof the Assembly, who naively supposed that the Bolsheviks would \nnot use force upon fellow socialists, was fired upon. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out.24 (It was also a very rare \nexample of Lenin using quasi-humorous behaviour to achieve a \npolitical end. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. The Socialist Revolu-\ntionary agenda was accepted by a vote on the floor, and the \nBolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries walked out in \nprotest. By late evening he was \nreading out the details of legislation that he now perceived the \nBolsheviks would stop him implementing.25 \nMeanwhile Lenin, conferring with the Bolshevik fraction, decided \nthat there should be no second session of the Assembly.27 A forlorn group of anti-Bolshevik Constituent \nAssembly delegates left the Palace, never to return. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. Lenin could at last relax. Bonch-Bruevich later \nrecalled: 'Lenin was agitated and was paler than ever before . Perhaps he was getting his own back for the \nderision he had suffered at their hands when, at the First Congress of \nSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in June 1917, he had \nexclaimed that his party was willing to rule Russia alone. With \nor without Lenin's actions, there would probably have been civil war \nin Russia after the Provisional Government's demise. But the \ndestruction of the Constituent Assembly, which was ratified by a \ndecree of Sovnarkom on 6 January, ensured that the anti-Bolshevik \narmies would be stronger than they might otherwise have been. \nMany Socialist Revolutionaries were to fight against the Reds, not \nbecause they shared the aims of generals from the old imperial \nregiments but in pursuit of rectifying the great wrong done to their \nparty at the Tauride Palace. The Bolsheviks had talked increasingly \nabout civil war since coming to power, but they claimed that it was \nthe Kadets and their allies who were bent on unleashing military \nconflict. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. It burned bright in the minds of Constituent \nAssembly deputies who had come to Petrograd demanding fair \npolitical treatment and the chance to bring Bolshevik rule peacefully \nto an end. Their current aim was to establish a government of Assembly \ndeputies in the Volga region and to seek the military removal of the \nBolsheviks from power throughout Russia. \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSOVNARKOM'S CHAIRMAN \nYet Lenin had an arsenal of self-confidence. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition.32 The Bolsheviks \nwould predictably dominate it since they held even more town and \ncity soviets than in October 1917. In \nfact, the division between Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries had become so deep that two fully separate \nCongresses of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies were held simultan-\neously. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. The tactical beauty of this, from the Bolshevik \nparty's standpoint, was that the overwhelming majority of the \ncountry's population were peasants and that Sovnarkom would \ntherefore come to appear as representative of the lower social classes \nin general and not just the workers and the urban poor. Bolshevik hegemony would be preserved. The Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were as naive about the Bolshevik central leader-\nship's ruthlessness as the Socialist Revolutionaries had been about \nLenin's disregard for the rights of the Constituent Assembly; but at \n The Obscene Peace \n311 \nthe time they thought the deal worth making since the Bolsheviks \nwere willing to offer them compromises on the single act of \nlegislation, then under preparation, that most interested them: the \nBasic Land Law. When he came to \naddress the unified Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of \nWorkers', Soldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies on 11 January 1918, he \nannounced that the Soviet republic had good cause for celebration: it \nhad already lasted five days longer than the Paris Commune of 1871. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty. 36 Lenin had imbibed enough \nof the revolutionary spirit to allow fellow People's Commissars to \nraise subjects not previously tabled for discussion,37 but his instinct \nwas to reinforce order and orderliness. 39 \nIn the intervals between Bolshevik Central Committee meetings,40 \nSovnarkom was the major centre of power in the country. Lenin tried \nto direct its entire work. Trotski and Stalin were invaluable collaborators, and \nthe skills of the Bolshevik ex-undergrounders at central and local \nlevels of government ought not to be forgotten. Trotski's past as an anti-Bolshevik and his obvious \ntalent (and, worse still, his knowledge of his talent) counted against \nhim. Of the other prominent Bolsheviks, both \nZinoviev and Kamenev had compromised themselves by their so-\ncalled 'strike-breaking' in October 1917; and younger leaders such as \nBukharin and Pyatakov, who were taken seriously by Lenin before \n1917 and who were to figure in his 'testament' of 1922, lacked \nLenin's prestige and authority. When all is said and done, however, none \nof these practical administrators rivalled Lenin. 43 \nNot that Lenin lived a life that was normal for most inhabitants of \nthe Soviet republic.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries were nervous about peasant feelings \nand on 6 December the new tax law was amended to allow local \nsoviets to exempt the poorer sections of the population from all \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntaxation. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation.49 \nThis title signified that nationalisation was no longer a Bolshevik \nshort-term aim. The Bolsheviks had \nwanted to base transfers of property to a greater extent with an \nincrease of productivity in mind; but the need to reconcile their \npartners in Sovnarkom forced them to give way. This meant that Bolshevism also had to forgo an \ninsistence on retention of the large estates in integral form; and that \nthe agricultural wage labourers, as distinct from poor peasants, were \nnot supported as strongly as the Bolsheviks had originally desired. 52 \nLenin won a few minor battles. 54 The return to \ntheir native villages of hundreds of thousands of peasant conscripts, \nwhose acquaintance with the Bolshevik programme was closer than \nthat of the normal rural population, made little difference. 55 Sovnarkom desisted from com pre-\n The Obscene Peace \n315 \nhensive forcible requisitioning, and Lenin's occasional talk of an anti-\nspeculator terror was not yet a systematic and lasting policy. 56 \nThe Bolshevik inclination towards using violence against the \npeasantry, which is traceable to the manipulative attitude to \npeasants traditional in Bolshevik thought,57 was emerging, but the \narmy which would be necessary to suppress peasant discontent, was \nnot yet formed. Sovnarkom encouraged demobilisation of several \nregiments in late 1917. The pre-October commitment to demilitaris-\ning industrial production and switching to output for the civilian \nmarket was also being fulfilled; and Sverdlov engineered the closure \nof Bolshevik party committees in the Russian army on the Eastern \nfront. 58 Yet military conflict, in civil war and in foreign anti-\nBolshevik crusades, was expected. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.60 Six weeks later, on 21 January 1918, the Soviet authorities \nunilaterally annulled the foreign and domestic loans incurred by \nNikolai II and the Provisional Government.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists.63 A state-managed industrial sector seemed \nto most Bolshevik leaders the cure for this problem. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists.66 \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Council's ameliorative impact on the industry and trade was \nnegligible. Even Lenin was \naccepting the sober predictions of his associate, V. Milyutin, \nbefore October 1917.68 There were still Bolsheviks who drew up \nplans for a perfectly-functioning system of complete economic \nmanagement, as Lenin irritably noted. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. Few Bolsheviks objected when Aleksandr Shlyapnikov was \nappointed commissar with extra-legal powers to restore an opera-\ntional network. \nThis menacing condescension had been largely, but not wholly, \nsubmerged in Bolshevik pronouncements before October 1917. The Bolshevik leaders did not \nenjoy the compulsion they were applying to the working class; they \nassumed that, in time, the workers would understand the require-\nments of the situation and would support the party. 73 Lenin's old adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nstrongly disapproved of what he regarded a a premature attempt at \nthe transition to socialism; and the dispersal of the Constituent \nAssembly appalled him. \nTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN DISPUTE \nLenin's restlessness with Trotski's tactic of 'neither war nor peace' \ngrew sharply in 1918. On 7 January, a day after the Constituent \nAssembly's closure and six days after the assassination attempt, the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders conferred while Trotski briefly took leave from \nBrest-Litovsk. The terms offered to the Soviet delegation by \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, especially the proposal that the \narmies of the Central Powers would maintain their occupation in \nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic region, had provoked a furious \nreaction in the local committees of the Bolshevik party.77 \nOn 8 January, Lenin could ascertain the strength of the internal \nparty opposition when he addressed sixty three leaders of the \nBolshevik fraction to the Third Congress of Soviets of Workers', \nSoldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. 'In any event,' \nLenin argued with Trotski, 'I stand for the immediate signature of \npeace, it is more secure. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee. Undeterred by defeat at the Congress of Soviets \nfractional gathering, Lenin restated his case on 11 January. But it would give time for the \nBolsheviks to 'strangle' the Russian bourgeoisie and to prepare an \narmy for a future revolutionary war- he made no pretence of being a \npacifist.86 Lenin was obviously not the only Bolshevik leader who \ncould point to another Bolshevik leader's past failings. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened. Yet signs appeared that Lenin was gaining ground: five \nparticipants now voted in favour of a separate peace.95 Their anti-Lenin \narguments were not as unequivocal as they might have been.96 \nAt Brest-Litovsk, time was running out for the Soviet delegation. Lenin urged \na rapid reconvening of the peace talks and, if the Germans were still \nwilling, the signature of a treaty on the terms specified in December \n1917. No one, to Lenin's relief, would any longer press the case \nfor an immediate declaration of revolutionary war. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). 98 Lenin had come within inches of political victory in \nthe Central Committee. Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. 102 Trotski was now \non Lenin's side. Nerves of steel would still be required; nobody in the \nBolshevik Central Committee knew whether the Central Powers, \nonce their armies had started moving and found the resistance to be \nso feeble, would agree to halt. The \nrespective policies of Lenin and Trotski, mutually contradictory, had \nto be reassessed. \nLenin, while suspecting him of posturing, declined to respond. 105 Lenin was horrified and threatened to \nleave Sovnarkom and the Central Committee: 'These terms must be \nsigned.' 106 Lomov struck back: 'It is \n 322 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnecessary to take power without V. [Lenin].'107 \nBut Lenin could see he would win. 109 Yet Lenin's victory was \ncomplete in the Central Committee. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means. Soviets, trade unions, factory-workshop commit-\ntees, and party organs: these were infused with Bolshevik personnel \nwho were instructed to get on with the job at hand.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. Naturally this \npushed leading Bolsheviks back into the central body where they \ncould resolve their own disagreements on policy definitively and \nwithout interference from other parties. The \nargument over coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries in November 1917 had involved a similar recourse to the \nCentral Committee; but the three months of controversy over the \nproposed separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmore intense and set a powerful precedent for subsequent develop-\nmentsY1 \n The Obscene Peace \n323 \nThe party as a whole resumed greater importance when the Brest-\nLitovsk negotiations were discussed. While the battle raged in the \nCentral Committee, Bolsheviks at lower levels was riven by conflict. Only Trotski \ncame near to him in prestige as a pre-eminent Soviet statesman; but \neven Trotski could have no claim to recognition as the Bolshevik \nparty chief. There was talk among them of dropping \nLenin from the government and even of imprisoning him if this alone \nwould guarantee the retention of a policy hostile to a separate peace. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. \nLenin also had the advantage of possessing a strong group in the \ncentral party apparatus. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. Lenin and his friends were old hands at manipulating \nlists of delegates. 116 Organisational manipulation was not the only reason for the \nadvance of the Leninists before the Party Congress. 118 His proven skills as a polemicist made Lenin, who had \nalways had a soft spot for 'Grisha', forgive everything that had \nhappened between them in October 1917. Lenin cannot have been \nwholly displeased when Zinoviev unleashed a furious assault on \nTrotski's vacillatory demeanour in the Brest-Litovsk dispute even \nafter Trotski had disowned the proposal for revolutionary war: it was \nimportant that Trotski was warned not to change his mind yet \nagain. 119 \nSuch attacks served to emphasise Lenin's unique position of \nleadership in the party. 123 \nMany Bolshevik opponents experienced inhibitions in attacking him. Safarov denied that Lenin's faction were \ndescribable as 'collaborators' with imperialism. 126 The sheer impracticality of the Left Communists, \nas they were becoming known, played into Lenin's hands. 127 In addi-\ntion, there could be no revolutionary war if only the local Bolshevik \ncommittee members were in favour of fighting it. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. 129 \nIt is against this background that the swing towards Lenin has to \nbe assessed. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. It is true that, by the \nend of February, many regional and province-level party committees \n- perhaps even a majority - held fast in opposition to the peace \n 326 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntreaty. Their commitment to intra-\nparty democracy was no firmer than Lenin's. Without Lenin, the Brest-Litovsk \ntreaty would probably not have been signed; and the Germans might \nwell have invaded all Russia. 133 \nThe second (and penultimate) day started with Lenin's political \nreport. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. Just as Lenin's Bolshevik followers had \nswallowed their pride by participating in Stolypin's emasculated \nThird State Duma in 1907, so now they ought to conclude a \nseparate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bolshevik leftists were like the Polish noblemen of \nformer times who died in a beautiful pose, saying: 'Peace is a \ndisgrace, war is honour. Lenin was lucky to face such opponents. \nLenin was gambling on obtaining a lengthy breathing space, on the \nGermans abiding by their word, on the inability of the two military \ncoalitions in the War to come together to strangle the young Soviet \nrepublic in its cradle. So \n 328 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhy bend the knee to the German high command at Brest-Litovsk. 144 Like other Bolshevik leftists, Uritski was \nhorrified both by the compulsory evacuation of the recently-\nconquered Ukraine and by the compulsory demobilisation of the \nRussian army.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. This was a polemical opportunity \nthat would not have been missed by Lenin if the roles had been \nreversed. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. 153 \nTrotski also helped Lenin by declaring contempt for the leftist plan \nfor partisan warfare conducted with 'the knives of Pskov peasants' \ninstead of rifles and artillery. Ryazanov was less charitable \nto Lenin's group, accusing Sverdlov of closing down the party's \norganisations in the old army solely in order to make it harder for the \nparty to resist the proposal for a separate peace. Maskov, a Urals \ndelegate, came over to Lenin's side despite having been mandated \nto advocate revolutionary war. 160 Debate was ended, and \nBukharin's closing speech predicted that the 'breathing space' would \nnot be realised and that Lenin would soon have to adopt the position \nof the Bolshevik left. Boki, noting that the Kronstadt delegate claimed to \nrepresent 3,500 party members, doubted that even 500 Bolsheviks \nremained in the naval garrison. 163 Thereupon the Congress returned \n 330 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto the discussion of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty and, as expected, \nconfirmed Lenin's pro-peace motion as the basis of its resolution. And where Lenin had spoken generally about \na breathing-space before 'the attack of the imperialists', Trotski \nwanted to mention 'the inevitable and imminent attack'. Lenin held himself aloof from the wrangling. The \nepisode gave further reinforcement to Lenin's position as patriarch of \nhis party. Lenin \ngave a joint report on two further issues: the revision of the party \nprogramme and the change of the party's name. His aim was to \nincorporate sections in the programme to highlight the differences \nbetween the Bolsheviks and most other adherents of the Second \nInternational. Lenin, denouncing 'bourgeois democratism', called for a \nnew type of democracy based on the Russian soviets. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. 178 When debate shifted to the \nquestion of the party's name, however, Bukharin spoke strongly on \nLenin's side; and the Congress voted to redesignate the party as the \n 332 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in order to distinguish it \nfrom other Marxist parties in Russia and elsewhere. Lenin pleaded with the leftists, \narguing that diversity of opinions was good for the Central \nCommittee. Lenin and Trotski, with thirty-four votes, had \nmost support. Trotski's success signalled his meteoric rise in the \nBolshevik party. 184 \nLenin, despite his brave face, knew that troubles remained in store \nfor the Soviet republic. His triumph at the Party Congress had \ndamaged relations with the Left Communists, and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were destined to leave Sovnarkom. \nConflicts between the peasantry and the local soviets were intensi-\nfied. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. \nAnd in south-eastern Russia, the Socialist Revolutionaries were \nmustering to establish an alternative Russian government consisting \n The Obscene Peace \n333 \nof deputies from the dispersed Constituent Assembly. Anti-Bolshevik \nregimes had sprung up in the Transcaucasus and counter-revolu-\ntionary armies were being formed in south Russia and Siberia to \noverthrow Sovnarkom. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. He did not control the Bolshevik faction \nand, in the First World War, his contacts with its members in the \nRussian empire became extremely frail and intermittent. \nNevertheless, at the level of political philosophy, he markedly \ninfluenced his own Bolsheviks even though they objected to his \ndivisive tirades; and, as often as not, it was Lenin who set the agenda \nfor Bolshevik debates even if he did not always win them. He had \nthe inestimable advantage that the maintenance of a foreign-based \napparatus was important for Bolsheviks in the Russian empire. Thus \nthe Okhrana, by arresting revolutionaries and severely constricting \nthe freedoms of the illegal labour movement, made a Lenin possible. \nAnd so he survived, acquiring the prestige of a veteran and a major \nthinker among Bolsheviks. Lenin, like his comrades, also found much to detest in the \nwhole political and economic order of pre-war Europe, and his rage \nreached a peak of intensity in the First World War. His \nMarxism evinced a fanaticism which was common in varying degrees \namong Bolsheviks - and it was alloyed with non-Marxist doctrines \nand impulses which he did not acknowledge. Bolshevism was not the \n 334 \nLenin: A Political Life \noriginator of all ideas of dictatorship. The idea that the oppressive \ntsarist order should be followed immediately by an order which \nforeswore authoritarianism had a long tradition in Russian revolu-\ntionary attitudes before the Bolsheviks existed; and it was not \nconfined to the Russian empire either. When he insisted that the Bolsheviks should address the \nnational question, he took risks with his own reputation among \nthem. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. Civil war was more the making of Lenin than of any other \nsingle person. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. \nLenin's policies misjudged the enormity of the old Russian em-\npire's crisis. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. The chances of the prolonged survival of such a regime, \nlinking Bolsheviks with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, \nhad never been large; but Lenin was prominent in preventing the \nattempt from being made. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world. The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In 1918 the Bolshevik-led \nReds had fought against the armies assembled by the Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in the Volga. Russians fought with Russians. The first great campaign after \nthe October Revolution was the invasion of the Ukraine by Bolshevik-\nled troops in December 1917. There was also much fighting \nbetween the various non-Russian peoples. In December 1919 the Supreme \nAllied Council called for a frontier to be drawn between Russia and \n117 \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPoland (which was to be named the Curzon Line after the British \nForeign Secretary). The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation. In addition, conflicts had occurred between Polish and \nnon-Bolshevik Ukrainian forces.2 \nSuch seizures of power had happened so often in the Ukraine in the \nprevious years that Lenin was not unduly disconcerted. Bolsheviks \nwere enjoined by him to treat 'the new adventure with utmost \ntranquillity'.4 Other Bolsheviks who had \nadvocated the same treaty were not immune from a subsequent \ncompulsion to prove their revolutionary credentials by advocating \nrisky ultra-leftist putsches. But Lenin had no need to demonstrate the genuineness of his \nradicalism. The Bolsheviks would be \ndisclosing a desire to use their armies to envelop Europe in political \ndisturbances and insurrections. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. This act showed \nthat the Bolsheviks aimed at more than hot pursuit in order to teach \nPilsudski a lesson. The Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee, \nor Polrevkom, proclaimed the removal of the country's existing cabinet \nand issued decrees on land, industry, administration and security in line \nwith Bolshevik policies in Russia since 1917. The Polrevkom shifted its headquarters westwards as the Red \n 120 \nLenin: A Political Life \nArmy advanced. 10 \nInside the core of the Bolshevik central leadership there was a sharp \nreversal of the roles played in the Brest-Litovsk dispute. Lenin, who had insisted on avoiding war at that \ntime, had become its most committed advocate. Lenin was the sole fire-breathing enthusiast. His \nperception of the significance of nationalism was acute in relation \nmainly to the territory of the old Russian empire (whereas the \nBolshevik left tended to have fuzzy vision here). They, moreover, shared the \nassumption that the October Revolution in Russia would expire unless \nfraternal revolutionary states were established elsewhere in Europe; \nthey had also become loath to challenge Lenin's general judgement: by \n1920 it was accepted in the Central Committee that he had been right \nabout the October Revolution and the treaty ofBrest-Litovsk. Lenin \nwas furious. In late July 1920 it \nlooked to Lenin and to many governments in the West that he might \nwell succeed. \n'THE INFANTILE DISEASE OF\"LEFTISM\" IN COMMUNISM' \nIn April and May 1920, in advance of the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, Lenin composed a pamphlet of thirty \nthousand words. 17 \nThe pamphlet began with a declaration: 'At the present historical \nmoment, the situation is precisely that the Russian model displays \nsomething - and something extremely essential - to all countries about \ntheir inevitable and not distant future.19 The \nBolsheviks in Lenin's opinion had been placed in an excellent position \nto learn the necessary lessons early. The harshness of the Romanov \nmonarchy had forced Russian socialist theorists into becoming emigres \nand thus brought them into contact with the rest of the world's latest \nideas, and the years before 1917 saw the Bolsheviks test these out \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintensively in a variety of activities: illegal and legal work; small party \ngroups and mass organisation; parliamentarianism and terrorism.2\u00b0 \nLenin's argument was that the Bolshevik tradition had not been leftism \nfor its own sake.21 (This was also a piece of self-\npromotion: Lenin had wanted both to enter the Duma and sign the \npeace. Lenin wanted to describe the less rumbustious \nepisodes of the past.25 \nLenin was scathingly realistic: 'We can (and must) begin to construct \nsocialism not from human material which exists in fairy-tales and is \nspecially created by us but from the legacy bequeathed to us by \ncapitalism.27 Lenin repeated his pre-1914 \nargument that, while parliamentarianism would not produce a \n The Tar in the Honey \n123 \ntransition to socialism, no party should pass up the opportunities \nafforded by Dumas and Reichstags for propaganda.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. Lenin insisted \nthat, as the Bolsheviks had had to accept the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, so \nthe German comrades might even have to acquiesce in the treaty of \nVersailles for a lengthy period. Lenin did not wish to discourage sympathisers. Lenin asserted that similar deals had been done \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks before 1917. A Bolshevik-Menshevik coalition had \nbeen formed in 1906 because most Bolsheviks and Mensheviks desired \nit; they did not come together because a newly-formed Bolshevik \nfaction wanted to become more influential by means of association \nwith a more popular Menshevik faction. Js Lenin added that 'the \nconditions for a successful proletarian revolution were clearly growing' \nin Britain. It showed how confident \nLenin had become. He was claiming, not too subtly, the \nwisdom of the patriarch; and, whenever he indicated past mistakes \nmade by the Bolshevik party, he adduced the rashness of his own \nBolshevik opponents. He \nalso played on the assumption that no one would have the knowledge \nor presumption to challenge his tendentious exposition of Bolshevik \nparty history. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.3 \nTHE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERNATIONAL \nDelegates to the Second Communist International Congress congre-\ngated in Moscow in summer 1920 and, in deference to Petrograd's \nstatus as the birthplace of the October Revolution, they took the train \nto the north and assembled in the Smolny Institute on 19 July 1920. In \nparticular, he called upon member parties to accept the organisational \nrules proposed by the Bolshevik party.43 \nLenin erroneously asserted that the British Independent Labour Party \nwas seeking affiliation to the Communist International.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. For Bauer \ncontended that Bolshevism, while being suited to the peculiar \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconditions of Russia, ill-befitted the rest of industrial Europe.47 Giacinto \nSerrati from the Italian Socialist Party congratulated the Red Army on \na campaign that was going welt against the Potes.51 The second session was delayed for \nfour days white Lenin and his Russian colleagues concentrated on the \nPolish war. 54 \nThe Bolshevik leaders manipulated the proceedings with cunning. He had not forgotten \nhis problems with the Bolshevik party at the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919. Capitalism, Lenin maintained, could not be \nleapt o'er.61 In mid-1920, faced with Communist \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \nInternational comrades from entirely non-industrialised countries, he \nhad had to re-think his strategy. In 1917 \nhe had still been contending that capitalism already existed to a very \nlarge extent in the former Russian empire.63 \nNor did Lenin yet try to link his newly-developed thinking to his \npractice in 1917. The strategy of the Bolshevik leader in the October \nRevolution was replete with inchoateness and contradictions; but, at \nleast in some respects, it was premised on the capacity of a Russia \nwhich was not fully industrialised to move directly, even if gradually, \ntowards a socialist order.64 This, too, was a linkage made by Lenin \nonly in 1922. For Lenin, it was de rigueur to present himself as the most \northodox Marxist; and he was untroubled by the fact that this \nnecessitated playing fast and loose with the contents of Marx's \ncorrespondence with Russian nineteenth-century agrarian Marxists. The \nideological liaison between Lenin and Roy was disrupted momentarily \n The Tar in the Honey \n129 \nby Serrati's awkward comment that words such as 'backward' were \nundefined and amenable to chauvinistic and pseudo-revolutionary \ninterpretation.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo.72 Crispien stood up to it, castigating Bolshevik attitudes to \nrevolutionary terror and to the peasant question.73 Belatedly, on 30 \nJuly, Lenin joined in. The Bolsheviks had selected him to deliver the report on \nparliamentarianism.80 Not until4 August, in session thirteen and over two \nweeks into the Congress, was a report offered by a leader who did not \ncome from the Bolsheviks.81 \nLenin recounted his experience with the Bolshevik party in 1917, \nwhen he had initially hoped to incorporate the principle of land \nnationalisation and, after criticism, had had to remove this particular \ndemand from his theses.83 Such heresy was attacked by the \nBolshevik Grigori Sokolnikov. The Bulgarian \nChristo Kabakchiev was asked to propose statutes which, by \nempowering the Congress to set up a highly centralised structure for \nthe Communist International, would lend still greater power to the \nBolsheviks. After all that \nLenin had said about Europe's 'social-chauvinists' and his schismatic \nbehaviour in 1917, the British comrades were as much mystified \nas annoyed.93 \nBy the closing rally on 7 August 1920 the Bolsheviks could look back \non a Congress where no attempt at any basic alteration of their \nimperious proposals had been successful. It was a triumph for \nBolshevism and for Lenin in particular. But the general tone was anyway deferential towards \nLenin. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. Lenin and \nfriends had breached the walls of global capitalism. Factory owners \nand bankers were the world's worst sinners whereas the Bolsheviks \ncould be brought to repent their ways. \nCULT OF A STATESMAN \nUnforced acclaim for Lenin came from the Soviet and foreign delegates \nat the Communist International Congress. Lenin, as leader of party and \ngovernment, was the obvious subject. Often Lenin, alongside Trotski, was depicted as a \nJew.96 \nBut the anti-Bolshevik portraitists did not know this; their intention \nhad blatantly been to stir up hostility to the Bolsheviks by playing on \npopular antisemitism. A cult of Lenin was in the making. \nThis attitude was superseded after October 1917. The Bolsheviks pulled \ndown the memorials to Russian emperors, replacing them with hastily-\ncommissioned busts and statues of protagonists. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery.99 Its rationale \nfor focussing attention on the living Lenin was provided by Mikhail \nOlminski, who had written a biographical piece on him for a Moscow \nBolshevik newspaper in mid-1917 and who in 1918 called for Lenin to \nbe studied as the incarnation of 'the colossal revolutionary proletarian \ncollective' .100 By then the Bolshevik press had been lavishing regular \npraise on the party's chief. A poem in his honour had been published in \nPravda as early as 29 October 1917.1\u00b01 An official photograph was \ntaken of him in January 1918 and reproduced extensively}02 May Day \nwas celebrated in the same year by Demyan Bedny, a Bolshevik \nversifier, with a paean entitled 'To The Leader'. 103 \nThe attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918 was followed by \noutpourings about his preciousness to the party. A sentimentalised \naccount was written by Grigori Zinoviev, who asserted that Lenin had \nundergone penury in Switzerland in service of the revolutionary \ncause. Lenin \nwas said to have been 'crowned with thorns of slander'; and \nL.' 106 \nLenin did not encourage this overtly. Lenin made his \nexcuses and left in the middle of the proceedings. Others had put it more crudely by stating that Lenin had \nbecome a dictator.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. On his return to Russia in 1917 he \nhad been inventive in fashioning his message and his image under the \nscrutiny of public opinion. He did not stop trying to identify himself \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith the working class after the October Revolution. Lenin also went \non wearing his workman's peaked cap, which had been effective in \nwinning popularity at mass meetings in 1917. It had been weeks after his arrival in Petrograd in \n1917 before Lenin acquired an ease before crowds, and he never \nlearned how to relax in front of the camera. \nKnowledge about Lenin was perforce restricted. The ubiquitousness of \nthe 'Lenin cult' was therefore a mainly posthumous phenomenon. 117 This phenomenon did not mean that most \npeasants were consciously pro-Bolshevik. Lenin was not an ordinary Russian. \nLenin did not share the aspirations of ordinary Russians. 119 Lenin, however, remon-\nstrated that German communists should even form what he called 'an \nunnatural bloc' with the extreme political right in such a contingency. 121 \nThat Lenin should have impressed this upon Levi was remarkable \nenough: the advocate of'European civil war' in 1914-1917 had become \nthe supporter of a Burgfrieden between the German bourgeoisie and \nworking class. Lenin sensed that \nthe long-awaited pan-European revolution was imminent. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. They assumed \nthat the Bolsheviks were internationalist in ideology but Russians in \nintention. This notion was given credence by the summons of the anti-\nBolshevik General Brusilov, in retirement since 1917, and to all \nRussian officers to rally to the Russian flag in the country's hour of \nneed. 133 \nThroughout the campaign Lenin had thrust the Red Army into an \naggressive posture. The Bolsheviks themselves would have to sue for peace. 140 \n 138 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAt last the lid placed on internal Bolshevik disputes was blown off. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. This was the \nmotivation, according to Lenin, for Pilsudski's incursion into the \nUkraine. The Bolsheviks could sue for peace from a \nposition of strength. 144 Lenin, by means of Pravda, was seeking \nto deceive foreign embassies into believing that the Red Army could \nand would fight on regardless. His had been the first trip abroad \nby a major Bolshevik figure since before the October Revolution (and \nit is worth noting by comparison that Lenin, an inveterate traveller \nbefore 1917, made no foreign excursion for the rest of his life; indeed he \ntravelled no further than from Moscow to Petrograd on any particular \noccasion). Kamenev warned that the Committee of Action in England \nwas constituted by anti-Bolsheviks. The Red Army had in fact been routed; but, according to Trotski \nat the Conference, this had been unforeseeable (even though he had, \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonths beforehand, foreseen it). Minin, serving as political commissar with the \nFirst Cavalry Army, charged Lenin with evading basic questions. The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. 168 Lenin joined the assault on Stalin. Neither Lenin nor Trotski deigned to respond. Perhaps Lenin \nwould not have offended so many fellow Bolsheviks even if he had been \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngiven one of the 'dirty' jobs in the Red Army done by Trotski and \nStalin. 177 But Lenin intervened only briefly, \nopining that the Central Committee's attackers were not so much \ndemagogic as simply exhausted. He recalled that, in the \ncorridors of the Congress, he had canvassed non-Soviet participants to \ntake more active steps to support the Bolsheviks. A \nseizure of power there by socialists continued to be regarded as crucial \nto the flourishing of the Soviet regime, and Clara Zetkin was invited to \naddress the Party Conference in connection with recent developments. 185 By 1920 she had become an admirer of the Bolshevik \nleader. Snapping away at the heels of Zinoviev and \n- not so discreetly - Lenin, he noted how the caution of the Bolshevik \ncentral party leadership about the possibility of imminent socialist \nrevolution in Europe had changed abruptly into extraordinary \noptimism as the Red Army advanced into Poland. \nThis, he stated, was untrue; and he added that Lenin's own The \nInfantile Disease, published shortly before the Congress, had had the \npurpose of pushing away those leftists who were not entirely adherents \nof Bolshevik party policies. Accused of unwarranted \npessimism, he reminded the Conference that it had been leaders such \nas Kamenev and Zinoviev who had opposed the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in October 1917. 194 Lenin's political report, which had \nopened the Conference, was not even voted upon. Even more extra-\nordinary was Lenin's absence from the last session.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin. Schisms among Russian \nMarxists before 1914 led him to cease to show respect for \nPlekhanov, Trotski, Martov, Maslov, Zhordania and Bogdanov. It is true that practically all prominent \nBolsheviks, including those of a practical bent like Stalin, had \npretensions as Marxist theorists. Trotski, moreover, had returned to Lenin's side \nand was a political thinker of distinction among Bolsheviks. Never-\ntheless Lenin paid them little heed, reading their books but not \nadjusting his ideas much in reaction. 197 \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe single Bolshevik who figured in his mind as a commensurate \ntheorist was Nikolai Bukharin. Lenin had followed his career in the \nGreat War with almost fatherly care. But in 1917 they agreed about more than they disagreed \nabout. 199 Thenceforward Lenin felt himself to be the \nonly true propagator and developer of Marxism in the twentieth \ncentury. \nBogdanov and Lenin had fought a political and philosophical battle in \n1908-1909, ending with an organisational schism between their \nrespective supporters in the Bolshevik faction. Lenin had several \ncardinal objections to him.203 Lenin had forgiven Bukharin his alleged anarchism in the \nGreat War (and indeed had recognised that the allegation was \nunfounded). 204 He had forgiven him his Left Communism in 1918. Lenin adopted an ironical stance: 'Ooot1 Oh. Lenin himself wrote in the jargon of \ncontemporary Marxism, often with tedious prolixity; but he would \nnever have allowed himself to refer, for example, to wartime economic \ncollapse as 'expanded negative reproduction'207 or to the effects of \nBolshevik policy in 1918-1920 as 'the resurrection of industry in a \nsocialist formu1ation'. \nMarxism)'. Lenin tried to sugar the pill. The phrase that state \npower was 'concentrated and organised social force' appealed to Lenin. '218 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's recensio academica contained the following headline: 'A \nspoonful of tar in a barrel of honey. These alleviated Lenin's concern lest \nBukharin should go over not only to Bogdanov's philosophy but even \nto his political recommendations; for Bogdanov had always con-\ndemned the violence and illegitimacy of the October Revolution. These aspects were but lightly \ndrawn, but Lenin was alert to them. In the first place, there were \nBukharin's repeated Eositive references to 'sociology': always a term \nspat out by Lenin.225 \nThe introduction written for this new edition mentioned Bogdanov; \nbut Bukharin was an equal, if unnamed, target as Lenin renewed the \n The Tar in the Honey \n149 \nintra-Bolshevik dispute on philosophy.226 Lenin was motivated not \nonly by the intellectual issues but also by their connection with current \npolitical discussions in the party about the working class. But \nthe Bolshevik party's claim to have hundreds of thousands of working-\nclass members was accompanied by the acknowledgement that most of \nthem had no active role in party life.227 This was anathema to Lenin as a \nstrategy of revolutionary change, and he derided Bogdanov's ideas on \n'proletarian culture' as themselves being 'bourgeois and reaction-\nary\u2022.22H \nThe necessity for the working class to undergo cultural development \nafter the October Revolution had been asserted by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution in mid-1917.232 Lenin tried \nto intimidate Bukharin back into line.234 Lenin in turn refused. Bukharin's talk about the urgency of \nfashioning a totally new form of society with a comprehensively new \nculture seemed utopianism to Lenin. The cultural objectives of the \nmoment, it seemed to Lenin, ought to be less ambitious: literacy, \naccount-keeping and administrative capacity. On 9 October 1920 he wrote to Lenin: 'I \npersonally consider that to \"conquer\" bourgeois culture in its entirety, \nwithout destroying it, is as impossible as \"conquering\" the bourgeois \nstate.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power.238 The disagreement with Lenin impelled \nBukharin into an intense bout of reading (which was beyond Lenin's \ncapacities since he could hardly cope with his governmental and party \nduties in any case).240 A row over \n The Tar in the Honey \nlSI \nBolshevik cultural policy was in the making.", "Bolsheviks_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in 1917, were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Millions of people perished in \n67 \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after 1918, was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. Russia, encouraged by \n Ad Extirpanda \n69 \nintimations of support from Britain and France, held firm. The Allies, including Russia, confronted the Central Powers. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. And yet he was little \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Obsessive as he was about controlling Bolshevik affairs, he \nseldom let them expunge everything else from his mind. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn 1914. \n Ad Extirpanda \n71 \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. The additional danger for the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders was that, as Russian subjects, they and their \nwives might come under suspicion in Austrian-ruled Poland as being \nspies. Anti-Russian sentiment was \nrife among local Poles. All Russian emigrants could expect to be \ncontacted by the police authorities in Krakow sooner or later and \nLenin was an obvious object of mistrust. Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. '9 There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. 11 \nIt was among the socialists of the Romanov empire that hostility \nto the war was strongest and most pervasive. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort.16 \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn 7 August 1914 Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. Lenin remarked ruefully that his party \ncorrespondence was left untouched. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. Marek, a social-democratic \nparliamentarian in Austria-Hungary, to seek his intercession on \nLenin's behalf.24 \nLenin returned to Bialy Dunajec. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 33 But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. 37 They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. Socialism and the revolution, \nhe declared, had been betrayed. 40 Its origins, \naccording to Lenin, lay in the international struggle for markets; it \nwas also an attempt to divide the international working-class \nmovement and to prevent revolution. Socialists ought to respond \nby preparing for a 'revolutionary war'.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either.44 \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov.46 And yet Lenin remained willing to \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland.48 The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. A meeting of the Duma deputies and other \nBolshevik leaders, including Kamenev, was held at Ozerki outside \nSt Peterburg. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. 56 Thus Lenin urged multilateral defeatism. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards.67 Lenin's \nalmost puerile stridency about 'European civil war' had no echo in \ntheir statements. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed.80 The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before 1914 in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. Lenin was instead infuriated with Kautsky, Haase \nand their 'centrist' colleagues who refused to break unequivocally \nwith the rest of their party. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis.82 Other Russian Marxists, however, believed that \nLenin and Zinoviev idealised German working-class attitudes.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. 89 Command over German socialism, according to Lenin, had \nbeen taken by the party's permanent paid officials; and he claimed \nthat these tacitly rejected revolutionary policies and had undergone a \nprocess of embourgeoisement. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914.92 \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'.93 \nWhere Zinoviev and Lenin marched intellectually, not only \nMichels but also European social-democratic leftists such as Rosa \nLuxemburg and Anton Pannekoek had gone before. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. The Baugy Bolsheviks added an inflection \nto Luxemburg's argument which would have annoyed her. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. 109 Kommunist was intended to provide a forum \nof Marxist intellectual discussion and to attract participation from \nleft-wing, anti-war socialists from other countries. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. After the Bern conference of Bolshevik emigres, Bukharin \nmoved to Scandinavia. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. In spring 1915, \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1908-\n9, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. \nFeuerbach: all to trace Marxism to its theoretical underpinnings. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. 126 This led Lenin to a further modification. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. \nImportant differences between the respective standpoints of Lenin \nand Bogdanov anyway remained. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of 1915, when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin.' 143 This is reminiscent of Lenin's invocation in \nWhat Is To Be Done. He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nD.", "Bolsheviks_1919": " The decrees of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War must not \nbe treated as an accurate gauge of reality. Nor were Lenin and his colleagues \npusillanimous in the exercise of repression. Merciless struggle, \nmonolithic unity and and the strictest discipline were catch-phrases \nof Bolshevik public life. \nThere can equally be no doubt that the Bolsheviks were violent on a \nmassive scale even if not as comprehensively as was their officially-\nstated intention. After the Eighth Party \nCongress, Lenin and his colleagues informed local Bolshevik bodies \nthat an 'extraordinarily threatening danger' was posed from the east. The White army fled in chaotic fashion and mid-Siberia \nwas returned to Bolshevik rule. He gave orders that any future official \nexplanation should suggest that local Bolsheviks were responding to a \nlocal emergency.4 To the Eastern front political commissars, fighting \nKolchak, Lenin had written on 29 May 1919: 'If we haven't conquered \nthe Urals by the winter, I consider the doom of the Revolution \ninevitable. Lenin gave way, but not before precious time was lost in \nsecuring Petrograd's defences.9 \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nEarlier spats had occurred among Politburo members; but Lenin had \navoided involvement. On 25 March 1919 Zinoviev had complained to the Central \nCommittee that Trotski was ignoring the compromises on 'the military \nquestion' agreed by the Eighth Party Congress; and Lenin was asked to \nwrite to Trotski for redress. Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. Lenin, with reservations but also with decisiveness, took \nthe side of Stalin and Zinoviev. Nevertheless Lenin would not go all the way with Stalin. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July. On 3 July, as the Bolshevik Central Committee was having \nits frantic meeting in the capital, Denikin issued his Moscow Directive. \nThe Bolsheviks and their Red Army, almost to their own surprise, had \npulled off victory in the main theatre of conflict over the Russian \nempire. Lenin celebrated enthusiastically. The bulk of the population also lived under \nBolshevik rule. Very well, then: Bolshevik propaganda should be \ndiverted towards attracting their support. But they and Lenin had no illusions \nabout each other. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. There were plenty \nof them, and Lenin's misjudgement about Petrograd was simply the \none he was personally and primarily responsible for. But he had made \nfewer than most of his colleagues; and those, like Kamenev, who \nforesaw difficulties more clearly than he, would never have led the \nBolsheviks to the party's satisfaction. \nGATHERING THE LANDS \nIt had been the ending of the Great War rather than any success \nagainst the Whites that had first brought Lenin and his colleagues back \nto deliberations on the 'national question' in the former Russian \nempire. The \nConstitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (or \nRSFSR) drawn up in summer 1918 was extremely unspecific; and even \ndebate at the Eighth Party Congress had avoided specifying what \nrelations were to be pursued among the various republics. The creation of \nindependent Soviet republics had been initiated by Lenin. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Otherwise, \nLenin added, the troops of the Reds would not be treated as \n'liberators'. In \nthe winter of 1918-1919, Adolfloffe was sent to Belorussia to persuade \nlocal Bolsheviks that the RSFSR's interest would be served by a line of \n'buffer republics' between itself and powerful states to the west. 25 Their \nimmediate re-incorporation into an undisguisedly Moscow-based state \nmight instigate an even more British and French anti-Bolshevik \ncrusade than at present. Lenin kept a rein on policy. Leading local \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n93 \nBolsheviks in each Soviet republic were not easily reconciled to their \nown declarations of independence.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Without Lenin's \nassistance, they could not conquer their own countries. The policy of \nLenin, Stalin and Trotski had therefore to be accepted. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia.30 \nEvidently Lenin did not want to be seen as an initiator. For example, the Politburo on 23 \nApril 1919 resolved to ask the Ukrainian Bolshevik leadership to \nascertain how best 'a fusion of Ukraine with Soviet Russia might be \narranged'.31 Such language indicated that Lenin was yielding now to \nthe arguments of the Stuckas and the Mickeviciuses. In March 1919 the \nBritish decided to withdraw their troops from northern Russia. \nFurthermore, the Bolsheviks in command of the other republics were \nnot always sensitive to national traditions - and often they carried \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthrough measures in total defiance of local society.32 For example, the \nUkrainian Bolsheviks had harassed the so-called middle peasantry and \ntried, in places, to impose collective farming by force. Consequently \nLenin may well have judged greater centralisation of authority to be \nless risky than letting the local Bolshevik-led governments enjoy much \nautonomy. Not that Lenin ever needed great encouragement to \ncentralise.33 \nUkrainian Bolshevik consent was also to be sought; and yet, even \nbefore treaty documents were signed, Lenin approved a directive to the \nparty leadership in Kiev stipulating that 'the People's Commissars of \nthe RSFSR should become People's Commissars of the Union with the \nPeople's Commissariats of Ukraine as their regional plenipotenti-\naries'. \nConsultations proceeded with Bolsheviks in the other republics. The Politburo controlled the entire \nparty and, despite occasions of serious disobedience, the Civil War \nwitnessed a strong insistence of authority on local Bolsheviks and \nconsequently on republic governments. In August 1919 Christian \nRakovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian Sovnarkom, was brusquely \nordered by the Politburo to close down several People's Commissariats \nand to dispense with a Ukrainian Council of Defence and Labour. Typically he \nwrote an open letter on 28 December 1919 stating that it was up to the \nworkers and peasants of Ukraine to determine 'exactly what federative \nlink' to have with Soviet Russia. But Lenin was disingenuous. 38 \nFurthermore, the Tartars against the expectations of the Bolsheviks \nproved to be aggressively self-assertive. As if this was not enough, the \nexiguous Bolshevik cadres in the Tartar-inhabited lands could not be \ncounted on to support the formation of a Tartar Republic along the \nmodel of Bashkiria.40 \nThe basic problem was that, as the Mensheviks had warned the \nBolsheviks before 1917, the former Russian empire was a quilt of \ninterstitched nationalities. No single ethnic group lived alone in a \nclearly demarcated zone; and, as often as not, the attempt to designate \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch zones aggravated inter-ethnic tensions. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. Mirsaid Sultan \nGaliev, a rare Bolshevik from Tataria, had come to believe in the \nnecessity of a huge Turkic-speaking socialist state being carved out of \nthe Russian empire, larger even than the ill-fated Tartar-Bashkir \nRepublic. He also wanted aspects of Islam to be grafted on Bolshevik \nthought.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. In addition, the non-Bolshevik members of the \nBashrevkom proved even more intractable in 1920 than in 1918-\n1919. \nOnly Lenin seriously opposed him. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. Just once Lenin took a trip to \nanother Russian city after the capital's transfer to Moscow in February \n1918: this was his sojourn in Petrograd in July 1920 for the start of the \nSecond Congress of the Communist Internationa1.48 Lenin had no \nmetropolitan prejudice. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters. Lenin was not \ncompletely intimidated. Rather he was astounded, and shouted out to \nthem: 'My name is Lenin. Lenin had further humiliation in store. They sought mercy on the grounds that they had assumed \nthey were robbing someone calling himself Levin rather than Lenin. After all, the Bolshevik \nparty was committed to the eradication of anti-semitism (and, although \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n99 \nthe fact was not bruited, Lenin was anyway part-Jewish by descent). Lenin joked about his surrender of pistol \nand wallet to the gang in terms borrowed from the lexicon of Marxism: \n'Such a compromise was akin to our compromise with the bandits of \nGerman imperialism. Lenin's telegram \nto Trotski ran as follows: 'In connection with the coded telegram from \nthe three commanders of the Eastern front I propose we should \nappoint [S. '59 \nYet his interference was limited mainly to emergencies; he recognised \nthat Trotski, Stalin and other Bolshevik commissars at the fronts had \nto take decisions without automatic detailed consultation with \nMoscow. Lenin was the motor of the political machinery. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms.60 \nLenin habitually chaired Politburo sessions. It was in the \ncollegiate deliberations of the People's Commissars that Lenin \nmanaged to put flesh on the bone of Politburo decisions. The Council was an adjunct of Sovnarkom; its chairman was \nLenin.6s But Lenin was among several \ncentral party colleagues who insisted. Lenin's refusal of \ntitles, awards and celebrations was to some extent a self-regarding \ntactic. Lenin was genuinely devoid of vanity. Lenin was a fellow of simple habits. He went shooting in the forests with leading Bolsheviks. His only friends were Bolsheviks. \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNearly all were comrades rather than friends. \nEXPORT OF REVOLUTION, SIEGE ECONOMY \nThe activities of Lenin and his associates in 1919 demonstrate that, \nafter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the party still adhered to its objective \nof European socialist revolution.66 \nLenin also wished to supply military assistance to the extent that the \nRed Army was capable.68 He and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership had been \nequally cheered by the communist seizure of power in Munich. It was beginning to look as if the \npredictions made by Lenin in 1917 were coming true.'69 \nAlready, however, the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics \nappeared fragile, and Lenin sensed that the Hungarian comrades were \ntoo reckless for their own good. Lenin defended his \ncolleagues; but the sole counsel he could give was as follows: 'Hold on \nfor all you are worth, and ours shall be the victory. Not only did he and Chicherin aim to avoid giving offence to \nthe Allies; they also strained to minimise the involvement of the \nindependent states in the anti-Bolshevik military operations of the year. The matter came before the Politburo on II September, and \nit took all the pressure that Lenin could muster to secure a decision to \nend the condition of war with Latvia and Lithuania as well as with \nFinland. But Lenin pulled \nthe Politburo to his pragmatic viewpoint. 76 Chicherin opposed on the grounds that such a policy \nwould destroy the impression, eagerly cultivated by Soviet diplomacy, \nthat the Russian republic was uninterested in extending socialism to \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nforeign states on the point of a bayonet. Initially he had \nLenin's support.78 But subsequently Lenin agreed with Trotski that \nYudenich should not only be driven back from Petrograd but also be \nsought out and liquidated as a military force. A breach in the wall of \ninternational capitalism, Lenin felt, had been obtained. \nThrough summer 1919 Lenin kept a discreet silence about Allied \nintentions.82 \nJust as he had not highlighted the danger from the Allies in mid-\n1919, so Lenin eschewed any welcome for the lifting of the blockade. Precisely this was said by Lenin in \nan interview with the Christian Science Monitor in September 1919.84 Nevertheless, knowing the unpopularity \nof concessions and being busy with a thousand other duties, Lenin left \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n105 \nit to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade to draw up a detailed \nplan in January.86 \nSo what on earth was Lenin up to. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. Lenin was a stealthy, sinuous politician. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. He emphasised the role to be played by the trade unions as a \ncounterweight to the Bolshevik party. But it was a sign of Lenin's \nconfidence that he refrained from comment on Workers' Oppositionist \nnotions.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. Militarisation of labour, for Lenin, was a regrettable necessity \nand not a policy to glory in. 100 \nLenin and Trotski gave their speeches on the issues without naming \neach other in dispute; the tone was comradely. Grain requisitioning was the cornerstone of \nBolshevik wartime policy: the idea that a private market in wheat and \nrye might return was anathema to the party's leaders. 104 But \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \non this occasion Trotski did not fight his corner. Lenin had won the \ndebate, and Trotski chose to concentrate on his work in the Red Army \nand areas of economic policy where he could get Lenin to compromise \nwith him. 105 \nLENIN AND RELIGION \nAmong the subjects which had been aired at the Eighth Party Congress \nhad been religion. Surveys carried out in the mid-1920s were to show \nthat the great majority of the Russian population remained Christian \nby belief; and the Bolsheviks knew that in the peripheral zones of the \nold empire - in the Ukraine, the Baltic region, Georgia and Armenia -\ndevotion to national denominations had been unaltered by the calls of \nthe party to abandon the faith. Most citizens of the Soviet republic ruled \nover by the godless Lenin were believers. Lenin on 23 January \n1918 signed a Decree on the Separation of the Church from the State \nand School from the Church. Lenin \nappreciated the potential of the Patriarchate as a focus for anti-\nBolshevik opposition. On 20 October \n1918, at the First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers, he argued \nthat excessive zeal in the extirpation of 'religious prejudices' would be \ncounterproductive. 112 At the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919 he suggested that the Bolsheviks would merely give rise to \nfanaticism if offence was given to the beliefs of Christians. Lenin was \ncunning. 114 It is highly improbable that Lenin strongly disapproved. liS Behind \nthe scenes, Lenin blatantly fomented anti-religious violence.' 116 \n 110 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Russian Orthodox Church was the one remaining institution \ncapable of rallying most ethnic Russians against Sovnarkom and was \nsingled out for maltreatment by the Cheka. As early as 1903, at \nthe Second Party Congress, Lenin had brought the 'sects' to the party's \nattention. The party should campaign for freedom of \nconscience for all denominations; and Lenin's friend V. 118 \nEven so, Lenin did not publicly refer to the sects at all in the Civil \nWar. 120 Lenin's attentiveness was little greater \ntowards Islam. On 20 November 1917 he and Stalin had co-signed a \nproclamation to 'all labouring Moslems of Russia and the East' which \nguaranteed their freedom to worship; 121 Lenin also warned at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919 against offending Muslim \nsensibilities, and declared that the influence of the mullahs in central \nAsia was even greater than the influence of priests in Russia. But one factor must surely come \ninto the reckoning: this is that the Bolsheviks were already regarded by \nmany Russian Orthodox Christians as a gang of marauding Jews. Almost certainly Lenin did not want to inflame Russian \npopular opinion by siding too openly with religious believers who did \nnot belong to Russia's national church. His decrees of 1917 and the \nSoviet Constitution of July 1918 had promulgated freedom of \nconscience in the Soviet republic. \nIn Lenin's defence it could be said that religious persecution was not \nconfined to the actions of the Reds. 125 \nNor was he the most avid advocate of militant atheism among the \nBolshevik party leaders. 26 Lenin won the day. Even so, he continued to \nhave to protect his position against Bolsheviks with ideas more extreme \nthan his own. 127 \nAll these extenuating factors notwithstanding, Lenin was a harrier of \norganised religion. 129 Thus the \n 112 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRomanov autocracy had needed not only hangmen but also priests to \nmaintain its power. But Lenin had yet to determine \nhow his government should tackle the question of religion. He sensed a particular \npotential menace in the growing attractiveness of the works of the ex-\nBolshevik Aleksandr Bogdanov (whom Lenin since 1908 had charged \nwith the 'heinous' offence of philosophical idealism) to some of his \nclose party co11eagues. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism.' 133 In fact the Bolsheviks had yet again been \nmisinformed. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But he urged that Bolsheviks in the \nmeantime should look on the bright side and get on with 'the peaceful \ntasks of economic construction'. 136 \nNikolai Krestinski followed Lenin with the Central Committee's \norganisational report. \nSapronov, the Democratic Centralist: 'In that case I put the question to \ncomrade Lenin: just who is it who will be appointing the C[entral] \nC[ommittee]. Kaganovich pleaded for greater \ncentralist severity did the tirades against Lenin relent. 'It is necessary,' declared Lenin in sprawling \nchunks of rhetoric, 'it is necessary to be able to grasp that we are now \nfaced with a practical task, that we must deal with the businesslike task \nof the quickest victory over collapse and ruin with all the forces, with \nthe genuinely revolutionary energy, with the uncompromising zeal with \nwhich our best comrades- the workers and peasants in the Red Army-\ndefeated Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. 146 At session three, the same evening, Trotski \nkept up the non-apologetic style with his report on 'economic \n 114 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconstruction'. 151 But Lenin \nrepaid Trotski's assistance to him. He also quoted from his 1918 \npamphlet The Current Tasks of Soviet Power.161 Lenin left things to his \ncolleagues according to the pre-arrangement of the Central Committee. 163 Lenin had less reason to thank his \ncolleagues in the other section. 164 His demarche was a \nreminder that even the more cautious Bolsheviks were yet Bolshe-\nviks: Milyutin overlooked peasant attitudes to nationalisation. 165 At this point Lenin, who had \nheard of the spat only the night before, intervened against Milyutin \nwhom he accused of being impractical and ignorant of Lenin's ideas. But it was an accurate assessment of Lenin's status: the Congress \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreversed the section's choice and took Krestinski's draft theses as the \nbasis of its resolution. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. Lenin was unconcerned that \nleaders closer to Trotski than to him -\nA. Sergeev: each of them preferred Lenin \nto Trotski. \nLenin confidently roused the Congress with his final oration. Finishing his remarks on the \neconomy, Lenin triumphantly proclaimed: 'We shall manage to resolve \nthis problem just as victoriously as we resolved the military problem, \nand shall proceed quickly and firmly to the victory of the Worldwide \nSocialist Soviet Republic.", "Bolsheviks_1920": " \nLENIN AND TROTSKJ \nBolsheviks wanted the Soviet state to guide all public and private \ninstitutions in their expanding republic. \nThe Bolshevik party had expounded such an ambition soon after the \nOctober Revolution, and elaborated it in its party programme at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919. Even among Bolsheviks there \nwere inhibitions about the desirable scope of the state's pretensions. \nThe October Revolution was meant, in Lenin's words, to introduce a \ndictatorship of the proletariat. The fact that the party had used \nviolence against the working class had not eradicated a feeling among \nBolsheviks that the interests of the workers should be protected. Leading Bolshevik \ntrade unionists, such as Central Committee member Mikhail Tomski, \nwere comfortable with the notion of a one-party and one-ideology \nstate. Lenin despaired of his Politburo and Red Army colleague. There \nhad been assaults on Lenin's management of both the Polish campaign \nand the party's internal affairs, and a resolution had been passed on the \nneed to reform party organisation. In Lenin's estimation, these were the issues requiring urgent \nattention. For a start, Trotski was resting his case on practicality as well \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas theory. \nIn Trotski's opinion, the working class of 1917 no longer existed. Lenin, as he had shown in controversy after controversy before the \nGreat War and would show again in the foreign-trade discussion of \n1922, was even more likely to act in such a fashion. Lenin would tolerate him no \nmore. These were \non the 'left' of the Bolshevik political spectrum: Bukharin, Dzierzynski, \nKrestinski, Radek and Serebryakov. Lenin was forced to back off. 16 \nThe commission's composition was balanced equally between Lenin \nand Trotski. Lenin was represented by Rudzutak, Trotski by himself. 19 Like all the \nBolshevik leaders, he had a genuine ideological commitment. \n 156 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski refused to participate in the charade. \nThis time he was more aggressive than Lenin. Lenin had gained a new ally in the person of Zinoviev. This was a position akin to \nTrotski's in the Brest-Litovsk dispute in early 1918. Lenin was as \nannoyed with Bukharin in 1920 as with Trotski two years previously. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. \nLenin remained extraordinarily complacent.28 \nVisiting peasants, however, did not let Lenin forget them. By pitching the workers against the peasants, Lenin was setting \nup a situation like the fight between the goat and the ram, in which the \nlynx, whom Belyaev likened to world capitalism, could be the \nbeneficiary.30 Lenin's defence of official policy was not quite as \ndogged as usual. 31 Lenin hoped to indicate that the Politburo was mindful of the \npeasantry's distress. \nLenin rejoiced. \nThis gave Lenin the chance to re-think War Communism.38 In the Civil War the Bolsheviks had exacted taxes, \ngrain and conscripts from village communes as a whole. Let \nus be clear about Lenin's new thinking.40 \nOn the same day Lenin gave a report to the Bolshevik fraction on \nforeign concessionnaires.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. Lenin laid emphasis, \nas regards the threat from the west, upon improved relations with \nGermany. Not only the Workers' \nOpposition but many other Bolshevik speakers saw concessions as a \nbetrayal of the Revolution, the proletariat, Marx and communism.44 \nLenin had greatly misjudged the adaptiveness of his party. Lenin trimmed his report on behalf of \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSovnarkom of those aspects which had been most contentious. Disagreements in the \nCentral Committee about the trade unions were being aired at the \nCongress of Soviets; and Bolshevik delegates had to be carefully \ncourted if the Congress was not to turn into a fiasco. Strife returned to the Bolsheviks \nwith a vengeance. In vain did Lenin propose that 'the best politics \nhenceforward will be less politics'.45 \nWhat saved him from humiliation was the unreadiness of Bolsheviks \nto undo him in front of the small number of Mensheviks, Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Left SRs at the Congress. The Bolshevik party's \nmonopoly was not yet total, not quite.46 \nLenin dissociated himself from such an abandonment of War \nCommunism. He railed against peasants who became involved in what \nthe Bolsheviks called speculation.47 \nBut Lenin was still not out of the woods. Polemics on the agrarian \nquestion were almost inevitable even when Bolshevik delegates to the \nCongress were on their best behaviour. On 24 December, Lenin \nrepeated to a Bolshevik fraction meeting that a turn towards 'the \npeasant individual economy' was required.49 Even \nLenin, however, was taken aback at the vituperative discussion which \nensued. Lenin was angry. \nThe Central Committee met in the emergency on 27 December, and \nLenin described in graphic detail how truculent the Bolshevik delegates \n Less Politics.51 Lenin was \njaunty. 57 \nAll was turmoil for Lenin, including his more intimate life. Lenin was present and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfollowed the coffin through the cold, snow-laden streets.' 58 Lenin and Inessa probably had a sexual liaison \nof some kind before the Great War, and the emotional tie persisted.62 Whether Lenin reciprocated her attitude to him is not \nknown for certain. \n163 \ndiscussion', commenced on 30 December under the gaze of the \nBolshevik party fraction at the Congress of Soviets. Lenin and \nZinoviev stood together against Trotski. Lenin \nconcentrated his fire on Trotski.' Lenin declared that the working class still needed unions to \nprotect its interests. Bukharin obviously thought that he \ndetected a theoretical gaff, and made an interjection to Lenin's speech: \na rare occurrence by 1920. Before the October Revolution, Lenin had called for the \ninception of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest \npeasantry'. But Lenin disdained to enter \ndebate on the topic. \u00b7n \nLenin had come upon a formula that would see off his adversaries: it \nconveyed pride in the results of the October Revolution while \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that the workers had a continuing need of protection by \ntrade unions.76 The underlying explanation is that \nLenin stood for party unity and was able to portray Trotski as a \nsplitter. Trotski reacted \nby claiming that Lenin's indulgence to the unions was a rhetorical ploy. \nTo a large extent Trotski was right (even though it is equally true that \nLenin was hostile to the extreme anti-unionism of Trotski). And yet \nBolsheviks in the localities faced conditions which could no longer be \nhandled exclusively by command and violence. Yuri Milonov, the \nSamara provincial party leader was unwitting to call for the \nabrogation of the party's dominance over the soviets and trade \nunions; and E. lgnatov, a Bolshevik official in Moscow, wished to \nsupply the soviets with the right to veto appointments in the trade \nunions. Both baulked at the request of Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra \nKollontai for an equitable division of powers among party, soviets and \ntrade unions. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd. 78 Lenin castigated \nShlyapnikov as an anti-party syndicalist and his ideas as a 'syndicalist \ndeviation' from Bolshevism.79 Lenin ignored the evidence. Shlyapnikov \ndid not want to abolish the Bolshevik party; his platform was not \ndesigned to entrust the working class with untrammeled power. He was \nnot a syndicalist, and Lenin knew it.80 \nLenin introduced a philosophical dimension to the discussion: \nalways a sign of his irritation. Resentment of Bolshevik political and \neconomic policies within a garrison that had supplied the shock troops \nfor the party in 1917 was reaching boiling point. The peasantry hated the \ncontinuation of the forcible requisitioning of food, the imposition of \nlabour duties and the military conscription of their young men; and \ntheir discontent was clearly focussed on the Bolshevik party and its \ncommissars.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A. \n167 \nleader, put himself at their head and incurred Lenin's wrath as having \nmanipulated the minds of Tambov's peasants. They were determined to \nsecure justice for their cause, and offered a still greater threat to Lenin \nand his associates in 1921 than they had to Kerenski in 1917.92 \nAt first sight it was a bit rich of Lenin to harass Tsyurupa. It is also clear that the striking workers and \nmutineering sailors did not yet unduly bother Lenin and his associates. \nEqually interesting is the lack of Lenin's prominence in the debate.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.97 Since the October Revolution the tendency of \nBolshevik policy had been in the direction of reinforced state \nregulation of the economy. \nBut Lenin had been shaken into re-thinking his own attitudes more \nand more deeply. He had taken detailed notes on grievances expressed \nat a special meeting of non-Bolshevik peasant delegates at the Eighth \nCongress of Soviets on 22 December 1920.98 In addition, he visited \ncertain villages in Moscow province: Yaropolets on 14 November 1920 \nand Modenovo on 15 December 1920. \nPeasants also streamed into the capital seeking an audience with the \nSoviet leader throughout the winter of 1920-1921. Their memoirs were to be written within a political \nenvironment that brooked no criticism of the Bolshevik party and \nSoviet government; and, in any case, the nature of his office was bound \nto deter people from speaking frankly even to a man of Lenin's \nrenowned approachability.101 Only the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries \nat the Congress proper made this demand. 102 The first Bolshevik \nofficial to do so in Lenin's presence was V. 103 \nDid Sokolov finally change Lenin's mind. \nAt a conference of metal-workers on 4 February 1921 Lenin merely \nhinted at the direction of his thought. Four full members were present: Lenin, \nKamenev, Stalin and Krestinski. 107 It was at \nthis meeting that Lenin, having listened to a report by Deputy People's \nCommissar for Agriculture N. \nLenin's draft was scribbled out on a single sheet of paper and handed \nto a working party consisting of Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Osinski. The intra-party discussions in early 1918 had nearly \nbroken up the party. Already the Bolsheviks were at sixes and sevens \nabout the trade unions; and, at a moment of peasant revolts, Lenin had \nto handle his collapsible party with extreme care. \nPolitburo meetings throughout February decided the personnel and \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \npractical measures needed to crush the resistance to Bolshevik party \npower. A cautious approach was \nmaintained: the participants would be lesser Bolsheviks and not the \nparty's leaders. Several amend-\nments had been made to Lenin's sketch. 123 \nNevertheless Lenin might not have reconciled the Party Congress to \nthe tax in kind if popular rebellions had not intensified. Strikes and food \nshortages shook the minds of all Bolsheviks in Moscow. Strikes broke out \nin Petrograd, and an anti-Bolshevik leaflet campaign had been \norganised. Arrests of active \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, including those who were \nfactory labourers, were demanded. The original advocates \nof the tax were denounced by some Bolshevik activists as being \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSocialist Revolutionaries (as indeed Sokolov had once been);128 and \nthe tax was said to involve a re-installation of 'bourgeois relations' in \nthe economy (as in fact it did). 129 From Bolshevik leaders in the \nUkraine, including the entire Ukrainian Central Committee, there had \ncome a protest that a tax in kind would impede the People's \nCommissariat of Food Supplies from extricating any grain whatsoever \nfrom the peasants at a time of an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt across \nthe southern provinces.130 \nBut Lenin held firm.131 Nor did he fait to \nemphasise that the contents of the Ukrainian Bolshevik protest had \nacknowledged that the local working-class population already \ndemanded such a reform so that they could barter with the \npeasantry. \nLENIN'S COHORT \nThe party remained in a condition of shock at the divergence between \nLenin and Trotski over the trade unions. \n173 \nthe country who grew up thinking that the October Revolution had \nbeen led by an individual called 'Lenintrotski' .135 In 1918, during the \nBrest-Litovsk disrute, Lenin and Trotski had avoided trenchant \nmutual criticisms. The London magazine Punch \ncarried a detailed pen-and-ink sketch of Trotski brawling in an office \nand knocking askew a wall-picture of Lenin. \nLenin and Trotski knew that such a menace was not as acute as it \nappeared. Trotski had been asked by Lenin in the October Revolution \nto become People's Commissar for Internal Affairs. To be sure, he may have been exaggerating concern \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nabout his ethnic origin in order to avoid receiving certain posts.144 \nFurthermore, his readiness to turn the party upside down in pursuit of \nhis preferred policies was demonstrated by the 'trade union discussion'; \nand his behaviour after Lenin's death hardly betokens a person \nreluctant to inherit the position of dominant party leader. \nNevertheless in the winter of 1920-1921, while Lenin enjoyed the \nappearance of good health, Trotski fought him over policy only; there \nwas no attempt to reduce Lenin in importance. \nTrotski was undoubtedly putting a sincere case, and he was right to \nargue that the trade-union question touched on almost every aspect of \nthe party's strategy: state power, economic reconstruction, workers' \nrights, local self-government; but he should also have known that the \naverage party official, tried and tested in the heat of the military \nconflict of 1917-1920, felt that debate was a luxury which was ill-\naffordable by the Bolsheviks. Scarcely a month \npassed when Lenin omitted to make such a comment.145 Lenin wanted the same objective, \nbut omitted to say this directly: the term was repugnant to the Marxist \ntradition. Instead the \ntalk among Bolshevik party officials was that, with his power-base in \nthe Red Army, he might become the Napoleon of the Soviet regime. \nBolsheviks thought much about the precedents in the history of the \nFrench Revolution. Trotski's non-Bolshevik past and his abrasive \ntreatment of the party in 1918-1920 gave grounds for the fear that a \nBonapartist counterrevolution might be undertaken under his leader-\nship.J46 \nLenin meanwhile gained from his evident wish to deflect the party \nfrom a damaging discussion. Lenin's motley \nadversaries used their strongest venom in attacking each other. \n175 \nas if the sole way open to them to prove that they were still Joyal \nBolsheviks was to refer affectionately to 'Vladimir Ilich' . Zinoviev hurried round the \nmajor party organisations on Lenin's behalf, talking stingingly about \nthe People's Commissar for Military Affairs. Those Bolsheviks who \nhad been at the front in the Civil War, he emphasised, had scant \nunderstanding of conditions and possibilities in the rear. 151 This group, forced to \ncome off the fence dividing Lenin and Trotski, scared Lenin in 1921 by \ndeciding initially in favour of Trotski. Lenin revelled in verbal \nambiguity. At a time of strikes and mutinies there could be little \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprospect of prolonging their existence, and Trotski complied. Party organisation after organisation, despite \nTrotski's visits to them in person, came over to Lenin's side. A cabal of fifteen leading 'Leninists' was addressed by \nhim as the Congress gathered in Moscow. Here Lenin put the case that \nTrotski should be included on their slate for election since he would be \nin a permanent minority in the Central Committee and disabled from \ncausing a split in the party. But Lenin also insisted that the main supporters ofTrotski \nshould be removed; Krestinski, Preobrazhenski, Serebryakov and \nI. Lenin must already have had it in mind to give full \nmembership in the Politburo to Zinoviev in return for his part in \nTrotski's defeat, and discussions were under way to fill the Secretariat \nwith officials who had taken Lenin's line in the winter of 1920-1921. Lenin was amused: 'What's this I hear from a died-in-the-wool old \nfactionalist. \nTHE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Tenth Party Congress was opened by Lenin in the morning on 8 \nMarch I 92 I. \nAt the evening session Lenin delivered the long-awaited Central \nCommittee political report. 16s \nLenin's implicit argument was that the peasantry's capacity to \ndestabilise the authorities had been underestimated. Lenin declared that the \nfactional disagreements in the Bolshevik party were an intellectual \nluxury. Lenin described it as a 'petit-bourgeois counter-\nrevolution' more dangerous than the White invasions of Kolchak, \nDenikin and Yudenich. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry. 171 The \nreal drama lay with Lenin's strategical change since the previous \nCongress. Lenin's attitude to the Workers' \nOpposition would only cause further disunity. Osinski, for the Democratic Centralists, \nagreed with Lenin that syndicalism had grown as a force in the \nparty. Nor was Lenin immune from criticism. Sosnovski, a supporter of Trotski in the trade-union contro-\nversy, quipped that Lenin had barely mentioned the workers.176 Back came Yuri Milonov for the \nWorkers' Opposition, claiming that Lenin as Sovnarkom chairman \n Less Politics. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin. Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends. With the recent conquest of the Transcaucasus in \neveryone's mind, Stalin stressed the party's objective of equal rights for \nall nationalities; and he expatiated a bit on the tendency of several \nRussian Bolsheviks to indulge in 'Russian Great-Power chauvinism'. The slogan \nremained dear to Lenin. Still Lenin kept himself out of the \nway. \nLenin played his part again. 195 \nNothing was left to chance, and Lenin on the same day as the last of \nthe emergency sessions penned drafts of his two motions on the \nsyndicalist deviation and on party unity. 196 In the first motion, the \nWorkers' Opposition was condemned for is allegedly anti-Marxist \nideas; in the second, factional activity in general was banned on pain of \nexpulsion from the Central Committee for any faction's leader (and \nfrom the party for the faction as a whole). He emphasised that in February 1920, so far \nfrom being unorthodox as a Bolshevik, he had put forward a version of \neconomic reform not totally dissimilar from the current proposal to \nabolish grain requisitioning; he revealed also that Lenin at the time had \naccused him of 'Free Trade-ism'. All 479 votes were cast to confirm Lenin's membership. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'.206 At present the peasants were \ndiscontented, and Lenin added: 'Classes cannot be tricked.214 \nTwo speakers followed in Lenin's support, including Evgeni \nPreobrazhenski: the Bolshevik Left contained many who saw that \nsome reform was urgently necessary. 215 \nLenin's summary speech at the end was characteristically combative. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'.218 \nLenin had handled the Congress superbly. Lenin was \nvital to the re-orientation of policies.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'.220 And yet even he, the leading figure on the Bolshevik \nRight, took a stern view. Then, in the closing minutes, Lenin quickly \nintroduced the two debates on party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist \ndeviation.", "Bolsheviks_1922": " Prominent Bolsheviks were not \nunusual in trying to hide away the altercations among themselves. Most \npeople knew next to nothing about the Bolshevik wrangling about the \nNew Economic Policy; and the rumours about dissension in the party, \nwhich had came to the ears of those observers with friends in the \nparty's higher echelons, were dying down. And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. \nBolshevik leaders, including Lenin, were irked that a retreat from \nsupposedly socialist policies had been forced upon them. Not only Lenin and Trotski but also the rest \nof the Politburo peppered their public statements with references to the \nFrench Revolution and its eventual retreat from ideological radicalism. \nThe possibility that the New Economic Policy might initiate a counter-\nrevolution from within was in their thoughts and was sustained by the \nstridency of attacks made by non-Bolshevik Russians in emigration \nwho predicted this very denouement. \nLenin's illness reduced the chances for differences of opinion \nremaining amicable in the Politburo.5 Even so, Lenin kept his own pessimistic \ncounsel.7 \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe central party leaders surveyed these developments carefully, \ndeciding to make no public announcement.10 \nLenin had always been attentive about his health.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. \nMaksim Gorki heard from Lenin about the pains in his head; his sister \n Testament to a Revolution \n259 \nMariya remarked how savage they had become by the winter of 192(}-\n1921. Professor Osipov, one of Lenin's doctors, was later to discover \nabout incidents involving more than headaches. On that occasion Lenin had tried to \nmake little of his difficulty: 'My leg's tired, I've got pins and needles.'16 \nThese were to be hints for Osipov that Lenin had almost certainly \nsuffered a series of mild strokes. The novelty was that Lenin now urged that Rykov and \nTsyurupa should use the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (or \nRabkrin) as their main administrative apparatus of supervision.21 \nThe sole full member of the Politburo to approve Lenin's scheme was \nKamenev.22 Lenin irritatedly replied on 5 May, defending Rabkrin and \nrejecting Trotski's demands about the State Planning Commission. \nTrotski and Lenin argued as if it could be taken for granted that \nLenin would shortly return to his political jobs. The scheme proposed \nby him was carefully limited to the matter of his Sovnarkom deputies \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand their functions. Not \neven his stroke on 25 May 1922 changed his attitude, and Lenin was \ndetermined to resume his full duties with all speed. The Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic's most \nreluctant f. 7 \nLenin, his bossy exuberance and his eye for detail restored to him, \nplanned to re-enter political activity and its intensity. Another hypothesis was that Lenin was suffering merely \nfrom massive over-work.30 \nThere was another potential diagnosis which the Politburo withheld \nfrom public deliberations: namely that Lenin had syphilis. As yet we cannot say beyond peradventure \nthat Lenin was not suffering from it.37 This perfectly characterised Lenin's circumstances. \nYet Lenin simply could not understand a life outside politics.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke. Valentinov also noted that, in the pre-revolutionary \nyears, it was usually a crisis in politics which precipitated the elation or \nthe depression in Lenin. \nSeveral leading Bolsheviks began to argue that the business of \nimports and exports therefore be partially denationalised.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation.49 Lenin's summer \nconvalescence gave the proponents of denationalisation their chance. Trotski, like Lenin, \nwas hostile to the repeal of the state monopoly. 5\u00b0 If Lenin and Trotski \nhad trusted each other better, things might have been different. Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski. Since its inception, he had stressed that the New \nEconomic Policy should involve the maintenance of state control over \ntrade; and he saw terrible dangers in any lessening of control: 'A \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspecialist-smuggler at the frontier is one thing; but it is entirely another \nmatter to have the entire peasantry which will defend itself as a whole \nand fight against any authority trying to deprive it of its \"own\" \nprofit'. After \nconsulting the other members, he announced the postponement \nrequested by Lenin.s9 \nActive supporters of Lenin in the party leadership's front rank were \nfew. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. The severe aches and pains returned on 25 November, and \nLenin was incapacitated.'67 The doctors this time were successful in their \ninsistence: Lenin was to stop work absolutely for a whole week.70 Lenin was a tough old bird and in \nfact kept on working; but on 13 December, at eleven o'clock in the \nmorning, his doctors advised that he would be seriously at risk if his \ndisobedience continued. By midday on 12 \nDecember Lenin had made up his mind to ask Trotski for support.73 To Lenin's delight, Trotski replied \npositively the same day. \nLenin had turned the tables on them.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership. \nTrotski had been highly suspect to Lenin since the 'trade union \ncontroversy', and Stalin had been among Lenin's most valuable \nsupporters in limiting the influence of the party's left wing.81 \nLenin's health problems in the winter of 1921-1922 had pushed him \ncloser and closer to Stalin. Vyacheslav Molotov was \npolitically more reliable for Lenin than his trio of predecessors: \nKrestinski, Serebryakov and Preobrazhenski.82 \nLenin needed a new Sverdlov, and he thought Stalin would fit the bill \ndespite the unsettled relations between them in the past. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. Lenin and Stalin differed about the prospects of \nEuropean socialist revolution, about the employment of Imperial \nofficers in the Red Army and about the 'national question'. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress.86 In any case, bad blood had not come \nbetween Lenin and Stalin; as yet their disputes had been kept within the \nbounds of a party which thrived on polemics. Just such a colleague - a colleague who had \nappeared to concur with Lenin on most fundamental current issues -\nwas to Lenin's liking as he himself made arrangements for his \nconvalescence. He was already a Politburo member (whereas \n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMolotov had only even become a candidate member when selected as \n'responsible secretary').90 At \nthe plenum of the Central Committee it was Lenin who intervened to \nput minds at rest. Quite \nthe reverse: Lenin thought the General Secretaryship so important that \nits first holder was asked to liberate himself from governmental posts in \norder to discharge his duties.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time.94 Lenin on this occasion was \nignored by his colleagues. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. He wished to allay any suspicion \nharboured by Lenin that the Politburo was doing things which, if he \nhad been fit, would have incurred Lenin's displeasure. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin.99 Lenin put Stalin at his ease. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. Why had Lenin chosen his political colleague for this \nmission. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. Lenin and Martov had belonged to \nthe same St Petersburg Marxist organisation in the 1890s; they had \nfounded the newspaper Iskra together in the emigration in 1900. \nSubsequently they had fallen out: Lenin the Bolshevik struggled \nagainst Martov the Menshevik. \nRevealing what had passed between him and Lenin, he asked them \nwhat he should do. Lenin perked up a little at this and asked: 'Are you up to some \ncunning.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. He himself had \nalways had ambitions as a theorist as well as an administrator, and \nevidently thought his writings on the national question to be a \nsubstantial contribution to a growing revolutionary corpus; and, while \nStalin could not match the flashes of inspiration in the humanities and \nthe social sciences displayed by Trotski and Bukharin, there is little in \nthe work of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Pyatakov or any other outstanding \nBolshevik politician which put them out of his intellectual class. \nLenin's overt friendliness to Stalin was anyway predicated upon \nneed. Their past disagreements had once provoked \nTrotski to shout at Lenin that he was a 'hooligan' at a Politburo \nmeeting. 112 This self-restraint \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmight now pay dividends. Lenin was acquainted with Trotski's vanity. He had his greatest impact when \nworking with the approval of Lenin. The October Revolution and the \nCivil War had brought them together, and Lenin was inviting Trotski \nto resume close collaboration. \nTHE GEORGIAN AFFAIR \nLenin's rumblings in the dispute over foreign trade were a pallid \nrehearsal of his volcanic eruption about the new Constitution. A \nCongress of Soviets was due to be held in late December, and its \nproceedings were expected to define the relations between Russia and \nthe other Bolshevik-led republics of the former Russian empire. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. \nLenin still desired a multi-republican federation wherein the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic was a constituent republic alongside \nthe other Soviet republics; Stalin continued to call for the other Soviet \nrepublics simply to be pulled into the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet \nRepublic with rights of regional autonomy. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. The Georgian Bolsheviks \nstrenuously objected to Stalin's proposal that the Georgian republic \nshould be incorporated in a Transcaucasian Federation (which in turn \nwould enter the RSFSR). Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 117 A \nregional federal authority should be able to forestall inter-republican \nstrife; and, much as the Georgian Bolshevik leaders felt done down by \nthis, they had not always shown attitudes typical of socialist \ninternationalism. The Georgian Bolsheviks had even \nwished to introduce a law on citizenship which would discriminate \nheavily against the several non-Georgian minorities in the republic. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. 119 \nWhere the Georgian Bolsheviks failed, however, the party leadership \nin Ukraine had some success. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. The trouble caused \nby Frunze and his associates happened barely a week before Lenin's \nstroke. Lenin's guard was lowered by a \nnumber of factors. \nAfter the Russo-Ukrainian flurry and Lenin's stroke the question \nwas again pushed into the background. Only on 10 August, weeks \nbefore Lenin returned to work in the Kremlin, did the Politburo \ninstruct the Orgburo to 'prepare the question of the interrelationships \nbetween the RSFSR and the independent republics'. 129 \nThe decks were cleared for a struggle between Lenin and Stalin; and \nStalin, quite apart from having the advantage of being fit and active, \nfelt that he had reason on his side and that the party would support \nhim. The memory of Lenin's difficulties on the 'national question' in \n1917-1919,130 when Stalin had been mainly on his side, reinforced \nStalin's intuition that Lenin would lose this time. 133 The Armenian Central Committee took \nthe same line five days later; and on 16 September the party's \nTranscaucasian Regional Committee confirmed this on behalf of \nBolsheviks in Armenia, Azerbaidzhan and Georgia. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'. 139 \nThere was a tacit reluctance among local Bolsheviks to accept the \nstatus of mere 'autonomous republics' for their territories. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. 143 It was at \nthis point that Lenin came back into the reckoning. The new federation was to be called \nthe Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia and not the Russian \n Testament to a Revolution \n279 \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. 147 \nIf Stalin underestimated Lenin's determination, others did not. Lenin would see to that.'149 \nLenin had got his tail up.'150 By this he meant not \nonly Russians in his party who overlooked the wishes of the non-\nRussians in the general population but also non-Russian Bolsheviks \nwho were similarly insensitive. Lenin was well enough \nto attend, but had to withdraw at midday because of toothache. 152 Kamenev and Bukharin \ntook up the torch from Lenin and denounced the seepage of \nchauvinism into the Soviet state's activities. \nThe members included Stalin, Kamenev, Pyatakov, Rykov, Chicherin \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Kalinin as well as representatives from each of the non-Russian \nrepublics. When \nLenin returned to chair Sovnarkom on 3 October, an agreement held \namong its members to avoid controversy lest he become agitated. 157 At a meeting of the Transcaucasian \nRegional Committee of the Bolshevik party, Ordzhonikidze referred to \nthem as 'chauvinistic filth' .158 The Mdivani group's complaint reached \nLenin's ears, but he replied that he was amazed at the improper tone of \ntheir criticisms of Ordzhonikidze. \nOrdzhonikidze delightedly complied, referring to the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition as a 'Menshevik deviation' . Lenin did not \nsympathise with them, and Kamenev and Bukharin wrote to them \ncondemning their action. 163 In vain did the resigners \nwrite to Lenin protesting the justice of their cause. And Stalin showed his guile by acceding to the demand of the \nGeorgian Bolshevik dissenters for an investigative mission to be sent to \nTbilisi. The dissentient Georgian Bolsheviks nervously \nawaited their fate. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests. 169 \nLenin in Moscow was beginning anyway to see the need to keep an \neye on Stalin.171 Lenin asked to see Dzierzynski and Rykov, immediately after \ntheir return, in Moscow on 12 December.172 Lenin was appalled.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. The Georgian Bolsheviks had \nbeen defeated. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. The Bolshevik \nparty leadership had been casual in drafting legislation; they were \nactivists and wanted action, not fine laws which could never be broken. \nThey were also collectivists and, although no one doubted that Lenin \nhad enjoyed a predominant political position, he had no formal title to \nthis effect within the party. \nThe only leader who could broach the question was Vladimir Ilich \nLenin himself, and it was typical of his tough-mindedness that he \ndetermined to do so. Trotski was the renowned co-instigator \nof the October Revolution, Zinoviev headed the Executive Committee \nof the Communist International and Kamenev was chairman of the \nMoscow Soviet. 182 Lenin's perspicaciousness was dipping here. \nRykov and Tsyurupa, who had figured in his planning for the re-\norganisation of the governmental machinery, were rightly excluded \nfrom the list even though they were prominent politicians with much \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncurrent power. Lenin knew that they lacked the weight to affect the \nbalance of authority in political conflicts. Few \nBolsheviks outside the Politburo membership would have judged him \nto be any more worthy of inclusion than Pyatakov. Stalin, moreover, was thought to lack \ncompetence as a theorist - a major failing in a Bolshevik leader of that \nepoch. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. 183 \nNone of the six colleagues came out well from Lenin's comments. Trotski by contrast was \ndescribed as 'the ablest person' in the Central Committee; but Lenin \nadded that he had an excess of self-confidence and was attracted by \n'the purely administrative side of affairs'. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). On Bukharin, \nLenin's comments were equally astringent.' Lenin was merciless: 'He has \nnever studied and, I think, never fully understood dialectics. This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. \nIn late December, too, Lenin asked Krupskaya to confide the message \nto Trotski that his feelings towards him since Trotski had escaped from \nSiberia to London in 1902 had not changed and would not change \n'until death itselr. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. The alienation of most workers from \nthe party was already a commonplace of Bolshevik thought, and nearly \nall peasants were either too exhausted or too ignorant to take the \nSoviet regime seriously. Lenin's bipartite summary of the party's \ndependence on the two classes, furthermore, omitted to mention its \nreliance on the sprawling administrative stratum in order to maintain \nits own 'stability'. Be that as it may, what is striking about Lenin's \njudgement is his correct perception that a party split could occur even if \na policy dispute about the working class and the peasantry did not \ndivide Trotski and Stalin. Lenin foresaw that a schism was possible \nsimply over issues of personal jealousy and ambition. 192 \nCOVERT OPERATIONS \nWhat Lenin did in his character sketches was odd; but, in strict terms, \nhe had not infringed the prohibition upon his political activity imposed \nby the Central Committee plenum on 18 December. Evidently Lenin aimed to have an independent source of \ninformation: yet another sign that he took nothing and no one, not \neven his new ally Trotski, for granted. Lenin reeked nought of this. '201 Krupskaya kept the incident secret from Lenin, \nhowever, on the grounds that he might be upset. \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThat Stalin could have lost his own self-control to the extent of bad-\nmouthing his leader's wife and comrade is remarkable. It may be that, \nas was rumoured about him not long afterwards, he had already \nconcluded that Lenin's life was fast drawing to its close and that he had \nnothing to lose. Perhaps he judged that 'Lenin is kaput' . But he also knew about Lenin's resilience. \nThe struggle over foreign-trade policy continued to exercise the minds \nof the Bolshevik leaders. Lenin was still a dangerous and important \npiece on the chess-board. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.205 Lenin evidently was intent on some political \nreform, and no one had more to lose from this than Stalin. But when \nshe saw Fotieva and their colleague Mariya Glyasser next day, these \n Testament to a Revolution \n289 \ntwo expressed horror at her action in destroying Lenin's letter. \nVolodicheva was summoned again by Lenin the same evening.215 It was Volodicheva \nwho took down the six thumbnail sketches of Bolshevik leaders. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session. All three were friends, and Lenin must surely have trusted \nthem implicitly.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command. In their later lives they were wiJiing \npolitical handmaidens unto Stalin; and there is definite evidence that at \nleast Glyasser took an anti-Trotski position in the controversies of \n1923.218 \nNothing can yet be proved, but it would not be totally surprising if \nthese young women, squeezed in a vice of contrary loyalties and \nsensing that Lenin would not last much longer, continued to yield \ninformation to Stalin.", "Bolsheviks_1918": " The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. Lenin, Trotski, Zinoviev, Kamenev, \nSverdlov: the entire leading cadre of the party took it as their duty to \ngo frequently among the workers and impress them with their \ncommitment to ideals which would soon become the predominant \npolitical reality. In fact the Bolshevik central leadership lived in \nconditions which, if they were modest by the standards of the tsars, \nwere yet far removed from the still increasing poverty of Russian \nfactory workers. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places. He was expected to \n29 \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspeak there in the afternoon and again at the Mikhelson Armaments \nFactory at around 6.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm. Lenin barked out the words, fist raised in the air and eyes \nsparkling in front of the jostling listeners.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas. The Cheka had had its \nmen present at both the Corn Exchange and the Mikhelson Factory, \nand Bolshevik party officials likeN.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nSverdlov and his colleagues were ruthlessly seizing a chance to lay \ncollective guilt at the door of a party which had been overwhelmingly \nmore popular that the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was to be \noutlawed on the grounds of state treason.22 \nSverdlov wanted to perpetuate the memory of the assault on Lenin \nwhile preventing a cult of the martyr who had allegedly attacked him.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here.33 Lenin was chancing his arm intellectually.'35 \nThe strongest sections of the booklet lie with Lenin's demonstration \nthat Kautsky had expunged the arguments for violent revolution and \ndictatorship from his presentation of Marxism. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. They had suppressed soviets and labour organisations \nwhich had turned against Bolshevism. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement.51 \nTERROR \nThe attempt on Lenin's life left him poorly for some weeks. \nNikolai II and the Imperial family had been moved around the country \nsince the February Revolution of 1917.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic.55 Sverdlov told the Central Committee on 19 May 1918 that a \ndefinitive decision was needed about 'what to do with Nikolai'. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. He led a small group of Bolshevik leaders in \nMoscow who questioned whether the Cheka should be allowed to kill \nthe people it arrested without handing them over for due investigation \nand trial. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign. The problem \nwas that Kamenev was outnumbered in the inner counsels of the \nBolshevik central party leadership. This resulted in a minor victory for the anti-Cheka \nBolsheviks: the Cheka had previously gloried in its licence to ignore \nother institutions. Bukharin as an individual \ncould not be acquainted with all abuses, and arbitrary, hasty decisions \nremained intrinsic to the Bolshevik party's policy. Lenin's speeches were peppered with exculpations of the \nCheka.87 \nUnder Lenin's protection the terror proceeded undisturbed in the \nCivil War.119 \nPerhaps Lenin for once refused to support him adequately on this \noccasion. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him. His instructions to the \nPenza Bolshevik leaders on II August 1918 are testimony to this: \n'Hang no fewer than a hundred well-known kulaks, rich-bags and \nblood-suckers (and be sure that the hanging takes place in full view of \nthe people). The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated.97 \nThese world-changing events made no appearance on the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee agenda-sheet through to the end of the year. Lenin saw the \nSpartakusbund, which was a splinter group of the old German Social-\nDemocratic Party led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnecht, as the \nlikeliest ally; and Joffe was instructed to start talks with them on 20 \nSeptember. Lenin wrote impatiently to Sverdlov on I October: 'Things \nhave so \"accelerated\" in Germany that we too must not fall behind \nthem. Lenin sensed that a German October \ncould follow the Russian October of the previous year: 'The \ninternational revolution has got nearer over the past week to such an \nextent that account has to be taken of it as an event of the days \nimmediately ahead. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. In October he had signed a \nfinancial deal with the German government for the delivery of 80,000 \ntons of coal to Russia; 109 and, in return, he ensured that the Bolsheviks \nof Ukraine did not try to attack the German troops. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. 11 \nLenin spoke on Germany for all his colleagues engaged in the Civil \nWar or in other political duties. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. Rosa Luxem-\nburg and Karl Liebknecht had been released from prison some weeks \nbefore Wilhelm Il's abdication: Lenin welcomed them as future \ncomrades in the cause of the Third International and European \nsocialist revolution. Luxemburg by contrast was a fertile theorist and \npropagandist, and her strategy for revolution differed significantly \nfrom Lenin's. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Like the Left Communists in Russia, she regarded \nBrest-Litovsk as a betrayal of international socialism which would \nhamper the making of socialist revolution in Germany. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. \nWhile Lenin hoped that the Spartakists would form a German \nCommunist Party, Luxemburg wished - if a new party was to be \nformed - to call it the German Socialist Party so as to dissociate herself \nfully from the communist Lenin. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. Once again she was \noutvoted; but she ensured that Hugo Eberlein, the German Communist \nParty's delegate to the meeting of communist and pro-communist \norganisations projected by Lenin in Petrograd, was mandated to make \nonly minimal concessions to the Bolsheviks. 120 \nLuxemburg and Liebknecht would have made uncomfortable \npolitical partners for Lenin. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. 122 \nREDS AND WHITES \nAmong the faults of the Spartakists had been their lack of organisation \nand preparation and their underestimation of the forces ranged against \nthem; and Lenin was right to highlight them. With no greater excuse he \nfailed to anticipate the abrupt transformation in the Russian Civil War \nin the last two months of 1918. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. Thus the Soviet republic of Russia was \nreduced to a territory little greater than the mediaeval principality of \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMuscovy. The Reds retreated in disorder on 13 \nDecember 1918. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. Lenin's telegram did not reproach \nTrotski or the Red Army high command. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. Since 1914 he \nhad rejected all attempts to make distinctions between reactionaries, \nconservatives, liberals and anti-Bolshevik socialists; his political \nuniverse was Manichean. When Kazan fell to the \nCzechoslovak Legion, Lenin and his colleagues had hardly begun to \n Closing the Circle \n51 \nreform their military and political machinery for war. The \nDon Cossacks were meanwhile causing difficulties for the Bolsheviks \nand their Red forces in the southern cities of the Volga; and the French \nhad landed their naval squadron in Odessa on the Black Sea on 18 \nDecember 1918. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. Lenin wanted no repetition of \nthe searing controversy he had had with the Left Communists. \nKolchak and Denikin might know about the Prinkipo offer; the \nBolshevik party, apart from a few Central Committee members, were \nkept in the dark. They were for 'Russia One and Indivisible', and in \nany case perceived that any settlement with Lenin would last only so \nlong as he felt too weak to attack them. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed. To the north, in Arkhangelsk, the \nexpected push against the Reds never happened; internal weakness and \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe unwillingness of the British to involve themselves to a great extent \nin the Civil War induced the local leader N.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. There could be no certainty that they \nwould hold Moscow against Kolchak and Denikin, and Bolshevik \nfamilies had to be ready to flee in an emergency. A flurry of long-distance conversations between Lenin and \nTrotski led to an agreement that the crisis on the Eastern front was too \nsevere for Trotski to be able to attend the forthcoming Eighth Party \nCongress. \nFEEDING RUSSIA \nThere is a recurrent supposition that Lenin resorted to force against the \npeasantry only under the most extreme pressure of Civil War. By the end of 1918 \nthere were nearly 140,000 committees of the village poor in European \nRussia; and 7370 peasant cells of the Bolshevik party had been \nestablished. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 152 \nDeeply implicated in establishing the committees, Lenin kept quiet \nabout the fracas. 156 Leading Bolsheviks \nwere turning to an extremely small region to victual both the Red \nArmy and the urban population of 'Sovdepiya'. Sovnarkom's minutes are not detailed on the point; \nbut it may well be that Lenin anticipated a resolution of the crisis in \nfood supplies through the stocks of the Ukrainian peasantry. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction. The Bolsheviks \nwere awesome pioneers in this respect as in many others. On coming to govern in October 1917, \nthey had expected to squeeze power in the party's fist. The penetration \nof the old 'bourgeois' state by revolutionary means was a declared goal, \nand the Bolshevik party was determined to direct the process. The assumption was that \nworkers, soldiers and peasants would greet the October Revolution by \nparticipating actively in soviets and other sectional organisations. The \nBolshevik party would send its representatives to serve and lead these \norganisations. A departure of men and women from party committees \ninto jobs in the soviets had begun before the seizure of power on 25 \nOctober 1917; afterwards it turned into a mass exodus. Thus Lenin headed \nSovnarkom, and local Bolshevik leaders moved effortlessly into the \nchairmanship of their regional, provincial and urban soviets. 1 \nThis did not bother leading Bolsheviks so long as the Revolution's \ntriumphal advance continued and the party's representatives behaved \n58 \n Only One Year \n59 \nharmoniously. The period had ended by the second half of 1918. \nAlready in January and February, the Brest-Litovsk dispute had \nshaken the complacency of Lenin and his colleagues.3 But it was a straw fluttering in the wind which became \na hurricane when the Soviet regime's resources were thrust on to a war \nfooting after the Czechoslovak Legion's revolt in midsummer 1918. \nOld public bodies were retained and headed by Bolsheviks. No one, least of all Lenin, gave \na second thought to demarcating the functions of all the institutions. In 1918, Lenin and his Sovnarkom colleagues \nwere dispatching plenipotentiaries to bring order to food supplies or to \ntransport. Lenin wrote as chairman of Sovnarkom, Sverdlov as \nsecretary of the Party Central Committee or frequently as chairman of \nthe Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of \nSoviets. Trotski was the sole \nBolshevik leader with comparable influence in the latter months of \n1918. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. 11 If Lenin with What is to be Done. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917. It was all \nvery well for Lenin to be complacent. Local Bolshevik leaders were run ragged by both their \nincreasing duties and the loss of administrators to the Red Army. \nLazar Kaganovich in Nizhni Novgorod and middle-ranking Bolsheviks \nsuch as N. 1s \nThis dismissiveness of the matter at hand was no longer possible \nafter Lenin had heard from Stalin and Dzierzysnki. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst. \nLenin had been involved in particular decisions; and some of them, \nsuch as those relating to the Ukrainian Communist Party, had large \nimplications for Bolshevism throughout the old Russian empire. But husband Yakov saw no urgent need for \nreform; and Lenin apparently concluded that, ifSverdlov felt that way, \nthen things must be all right. Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov. The choice of the three members confirmed Lenin's \nwillingness to leave such administration to others: Yakov Sverdlov, \nM. This is what I'm pushed to do by the interests of the \ncause, and of course the absence of a piece of paper from Trotski won't \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstop me. 'I categorically insist,' he telegrammed to Sverdlov and \nLenin, 'on Stalin's recalt.'33 \nIt was Lenin's convalescence after the attempt on his life that \nbrought Sverdlov into such matters, and Trotski began sending top \ncopies of correspondence to Sverdlov rather than to Lenin.34 Lenin \nwould normally have hated such a loss of personal control, but he was \nreconciled to this temporary condition by Sverdlov's obvious loyalty. \nTrotski repeated his objections to Stalin's contravention of policy \ntowards the employment of Imperial officers; he also criticised the \nappointment of inexperienced Bolsheviks such as Kliment Voroshilov \nas Red Amty commanders. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. Avanesov, an associate of Stalin. Okulov fell out with \nVoroshilov in December, and this time Lenin came down on the side of \nTrotski.41 \nThe thing was that Lenin appreciated the advantage of not \nidentifying himself too closely with either Trotski or Stalin. But Lenin, being a committed \noverseer of terror, mostly turned a blind eye. Stalin offered no threat to \nhis primacy among Bolsheviks.42 In 1918 Trotski was by far the greater potential rival. \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHis talent was indisputable. Lenin is said to have commented to him \nafter the October Revolution: 'And what if the White Guards kill you \nand me.'43 It suited Lenin \nadmirably that Trotski had to impose organisation and discipline in the \nRed Army. Lenin, smarting from his mauling in the Brest-Litovsk \ncontroversy, contentedly watched disfavour falling on someone else. Several Bolsheviks who had been prominent \nbefore and even during 1917 failed to cope with the tasks of \ngovernment. But Lenin wished to preserve the leading group in \nplace, and everyone now knew who the main figures were: Lenin, \nTrotski, Stalin, Sverdlov, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Dzierzynski and \nBukharin. This inner core held sway by 1918-1919, and would supply \nthe major players in the struggle to succeed Lenin.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. Only Lenin's premature \ndeath could have so juddered the politics of the Kremlin. Sverdlov and \nLenin had at least tried to make the other leaders work with some \nsemblance of harmony.49 \nSverdlov's death gave impetus for a re-organisation of the central \nparty apparatus. The Kremlin dyarchy of Lenin and Sverdlov would \nhave been ended in any event. \nLenin anticipated the re-organisation with equanimity. Lenin desired the intermittent \nfractiousness to be replaced by unified action in the Civil War. Lenin and his party were held in quarantine by \nEurope's governments. Lenin was thinking flexibly. On reflection he decided that more harm than good might \nresult at a moment when he and his Central Committee colleagues were \nlaying the ground for a Congress heralded since 1914 in Lenin's \ndeclarations: the inaugurative meeting of the Third Internationa1. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear. But probably Lenin had judged it \nimpossible while the treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be respected on \npain of German military retaliation. Lenin also always kept his eyes on developments among \nEurope's socialists; indeed he had paid more attention to them in the \nyears both just before and during the Great War than to the military, \neconomic and political forces of capitalism'. s9 \nLenin opened the proceedings on 2 March 1919 by saying: 'In \naccordance with the behest of the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, I am opening the first international communist \ncongress. The difference lent the proceedings a greater implicit \nauthority; and, by referring to his party as the initiator of the \nCongress, he emphasised the special role of the Bolsheviks.62 Lenin in turn was both exigent and conciliatory. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The revolutionary grouping in \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFrance had fewer than a dozen members. The remainder were \nalready resident in Moscow; it was laughable to pretend that such \npersons were not under the control, direct or not, of the Bolsheviks: \nseveral were Bolshevik party members. The contradictions of the \nrecords and memoirs of the next two days of consultations indicate the \nskullduggery at play; loyal Bolsheviks, then and later, wanted to \nsanitise the dirty work.66 On the \nsame day Lenin delivered his theses 'on bourgeois democracy and the \ndictatorship of the proletariat'. The Bolsheviks by then had their tails \nup. Nothing in the theses was novel for Russia since October 1917; but \nLenin sketched ideas which, for the West, were highly unusual. Lenin had \nmade the decisive achievement in founding his own International, and \nwisely refrained from pushing the Bolshevik demands too hard. There was scant \nmention of Marx, Engels and Marxism. Nor did Lenin discuss the role of the party. 71 On 5 March, Zinoviev's resolution on the Berne conference \nresumed the attack on Kautskyism, retailing the Bolshevik version of \nthe inter-socialist controversies about the Great War and asserting that \nthe Second International currently gave 'service to international \nreaction'.73 \nTrotski rounded off the Bolshevik contribution with a draft \nmanifesto which summarised the deliberations at the Congress in \ntypically vivid and compelling language. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).75 Lenin, having opened the Congress modestly, closed it in \nsimilar vein.] the \nmovement in favour of the Soviets is spreading further and further; and \nthis movement is nothing other than a movement aimed at the creation \nof a new, proletarian democracy: it is the most significant step forward \nto the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the complete victory of \ncommunism. At hand is the foundation of an international Soviet \nrepublic.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Lenin, especially after \nSverdlov's untimely death, was blamed for failing to co-ordinate the \ncivilian party apparatus; Trotski was castigated for co-ordinating the \narmed forces to the detriment of party traditions and personnel. The leading Bolshevik in \nNizhni Novgorod, Lazar Kaganovich, insisted that organisational \n Only One Year \n73 \nreforms had not been carried far enough.78 He \nappeared to be unaware that Lenin and Sverdlov had already initiated \nsuch a system.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. Authoritarianism, they claimed, \ndeprived the Bolsheviks of the organisational dynamism that had \nserved them well in the October Revolution. A sense had been growing in late 1918 that the so-called \nduumvirate of Lenin and Sverdlov had to be brought to an end. \nLenin's prestige, as well as sympathy for him as he convalesced, \nprotected him from direct criticism. No one felt \nthat Lenin did not work hard. Nor could there be any suspicion that \nSovnarkom would be more efficiently organised under someone other \nthan Lenin. Lenin was gently chided \nnot so much for lacking organising talent as for omitting to take \nmeasures to support himself with a carefully-co-ordinated team of \norganisationally-talented personnel. 84 \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe figure of Trotski by contrast evoked outright resentment. His \nearly anti-Bolshevik career had led many to demur at his recruitment to \nthe party in mid-1917.86 While no one questioned Lenin's sincerity, Trotski came \nwidely under suspicion as the cuckoo in the Bolshevik nest. Trotski admitted in 1919 \nthat 'Bonapartism' might arise in the revolutionary army; but the more \nacute danger to the Soviet state, he averred, stemmed from Bolsheviks \nin the armed forces who were incompetent or obstructive. Lenin did not disavow Trotski's policy; on the \ncontrary, he spoke several times in the winter of 1918-1919 in favour of \nthe enlistment of 'bourgeois specialists' in the Red Army. Apparently it came as a surprise to \nLenin to learn that the Reds had had to induct no fewer than thirty \nthousand Imperial officers in order to keep armed forces of any kind in \nthe field. Thereafter, according to Trotski, Lenin supported Trotski.91 \nAs late as 13 March, however, Lenin avoided antagonising Trotski's \ncritics and referred to them at a meeting in Petrograd as 'belonging to \nthe numbers of the most dedicated and convinced Bolshevik-\nCommunists'.93 On 14 March, still not having departed for the front, \nTrotski chanced his arm by getting the Central Committee to agree to \nprohibit leading Bolsheviks in the Red Army from attending the \nCongress unless a special request were to be made. Sergei Minin, who had befriended \nStalin in Tsaritsyn in mid-1918, was the most prominent such \nindividual. Lenin would not have made the same \nmistake. \nLenin delivered a eulogy of the late Yakov Sverdlov. International relations had dominated the \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprevious Party Congress, and most party officials had been swept into \nmilitary work in subsequent months. \nLenin was curt with refusals to serve on such bodies: 'You can't \ndecline, comrade Muranov. Bolsheviks applauded thunderously. 106 These included not only Left \nCommunists but also the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. He even claimed that, until spring 1918, the regime's measures \nin many ways carried through a bourgeois revolution. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants. Lenin remarked: 'Organisational activity \nhas never been a strong side of Russians in general and Bolsheviks in \nparticular, and meanwhile the main task of the proletarian revolution is \nprecisely an organisational task. But \nhis inoffensiveness was not reciprocated: Lenin breathed fire and \nbrimstone in his complementary report. 115 Lenin particularly asserted the 'right of nations to self-\ndetermination'; and, noting that Bukharin appeared to accept the \napplication of this notion to industrial societies such as Germany, \nLenin reminded the Congress that the German working class had not \nbecome politically 'differentiated' in its entirety from the German \nbourgeoisie and that any referendum of German workers would not \nnecessarily result in a vote for socialism. But Lenin was a master of \nrhetorical distraction. He acknowledged that 'a decree has not yet been \nissued for all countries to live by the Bolshevik revolutionary calendar', \nbut insisted that the prospect of European revolution had not \nvanished. Georgi \nPyatakov, Lenin's oldest Bolshevik opponent on the national question, \nattacked him. Finnish independence, granted by Lenin to Svinhufvud \nin December 1917, was castigated as a fiasco. 123 Only Central Committee colleague Aleksei Rykov supported \nLenin unequivocally. 124 Lenin, of course, did not intend to facilitate \ndemands for separation from Russia by non-Russian nations. As Lenin put \nit, 'Come across any communist and you'll discover a Great Russian \nchauvinist. 127 Zinoviev roused the \nCongress by claiming that the Russian Communist Party had won the \nright to exercise ideological leadership over all far-left socialists, and \nhis report was unanimously approved. 135 Lenin \ndetermined to stay clear of the dispute if at all possible. Okulov, another of Trotski's staff, \ncondemned the Bolshevik leaders on the Southern front who had \nnotoriously imprisoned 'military specialists' on a river barge rather \nthan admit them into their forces. 138 Next to speak was Southern front \ncommissar Voroshilov, who described cases of sabotage by the \nImperial officers and told the Congress that, if he had hearkened to \nLenin's advice, the rapid occupation of the Ukraine by the Reds would \nnot have occurredY9 Both Voroshilov and Stalin, moreover, \ndisingenuously stressed their acceptance of military specialists in \nprinciple; and Stalin added that he disapproved of those of Smirnov's \ntheses which were likely to undermine strict military discipline. \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nYet his disagreements with Lenin were evident.140 Lenin waded in. Lenin \nrevealed that the Bolsheviks on the Southern front had lost 60,000 men \nin battles against forces which were numerically inferior by far. Trotski's name had to be \ncleared, and Lenin did this without compunction. Lenin had cast in his lot with Trotski, and the \ndelegates were not inclined to rock the boat in wartime. Osinski in \nparticular had claimed that, while Lenin and Sverdlov had been \nacting as the Central Committee, there had been 'no political line'.150 Osinski, retorting \nthat Lenin himself had admitted that 'personal politics' had been \ndeveloping, focussed on the bureaucratic phenomena in party and \ngovernment and demanded a return to the elective principle. 151 Sapronov \nsupported him: he complained that too many abuses of power were \nreversible only by face-to-face pleadings with Lenin, who would then \nintervene directly. Lenin could claim that it indicated a \ncommitment to self-determination, Bukharin that the reference to \nunequal rights was not applicable in the areas under the party's control \n(since the Soviet Constitution guaranteed national equality). 161 But Sokolnikov had been compelled to make \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfurther concessions. Lenin understood this; \nTrotski did not. But even Lenin failed to follow things as closely as he \nhad needed. Among the speakers, a certain \nPanfilov criticised Lenin's pessimism and especially recommended \ncollectivisation for the prosperous agricultural communities of \nUkraine. 168 Lenin had not been without support, 169 but had had to \nspeak robustly to bend the commission his way. '172 The \nHungarian socialist revolution pointed the way to the future.176 There was a discreet abandonment \nof the idea, as proposed by Lenin in 1917, that workers and poor \npeasants would jointly rule Russia. 178 \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRevolutionary wars could be anticipated as the struggle between \nsocialism and capitalism intensified. The \npriority, in Lenin's words, was to 'attain a further rapprochement of \nthe organs of power with the labouring masses'. The rights of \nnational self-determination and secession, which Lenin had demanded, \nwere obfuscated in the final version: this was the single major defeat he \nsuffered in the discussions on the party programme. Lenin's original draft had been written in the heat of the \ncontroversy between Trotski and the Military Opposition, and had \navoided mention of the Red Army. 192 Lenin managed to effect a blend \nof clear intention and reassuring rhetoric which he had failed to obtain \non the national question. Eulogies of revolutionary justice, \nallowing the Bolsheviks and their supporters to feel unrestricted even \nby their own legislation, marked out a strategy for the party in the \npost-war epoch. \nBulwarks against the deployment of power in a manner undesirable \neven to the Bolshevik party are considered still more casually than in \nLenin's The State and Revolution.", "Bolshevik_Government_1905": " 7 Sturm und Drang \nBLOODY SUNDAY \nYet it was not only expatriate social-democrats like Lenin who were \ncaught unprepared by the political storms of 1905.

The Bureau would not \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconvoke the Congress until the Central Committee had definitely \nrefused to do so. Lenin pooh-poohed such feelings as formalism.19 Lenin was enraged. Convinced that he had been improperly treated in \nsummer 1904, Lenin had broken off personal relations with Noskov.20 \nIt would be difficult for Lenin to dominate the central party apparatus if \nNoskov returned to the scene. Noskov's Bolshevik Conciliators would \ninsist that Mensheviks be allowed to be elected as Congress delegates.21 To Lenin's way of thinking, Menshevism was a \ncancer in the body pf the party: it had to be cut out immediately. \nLenin's one-mad proclamation of the parting of the ways was saluted \nby a number of Bolsheviks in Geneva and Zurich. Petersburg in December 1904. 24 Lenin \nreplied on 29 January 1905.'26 This \nwas wartime, Lenin declared.29 Lenin \nwould at last get his Congress. He genuinely believed, in so far as his inner \ncalculations may be assessed, that Menshevik strategy as it was \nevolving in the winter of 1904--5 constituted a menace to the prospects \nof successful revolution; he was therefore equally intent upon breaking \nwith any Bolsheviks like Noskov who refused to engage in uncondi-\ntional struggle with the Menshevik leaders. The point to be made is not \nthat Lenin was being fundamentally insincere.31 He also made it harder \nfor Mensheviks to come over to the Bolshevik side.33 \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'TWO TACTICS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY IN THE \nDEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION' \nEvidence for the authenticity of his belief in the imminence of \nrevolutionary upheaval is found in his theoretical writings. He had it quickly published \nand transported clandestinely to Russia; and the rapid approval of its \nstrategical outline by virtually every Bolshevik demonstrates his \ncontinuing popularity as a theorist even at a time when his prestige as a \npractical leader was entering a partial eclipse.35 No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. \nAs soon as published, Lenin's words attracted a familiar accusation: \npopulism.3s Lenin's \nreply was caustic. The Russian \nbourgeoisie lacked not only the political will to destroy the autocracy \nbut also the social and economic power necessary for the governance \nof Russian society once the popular insurrection had occurred. It \nwould therefore fall to the Russian working class to carry out the \ndemocratic reforms vital to the reconstruction of state and society: \nworkers would carry through the democratic revolution. Did not their plans \ncontradict the Russian Marxist prognostication that a socialist revolu-\ntion could occur in any country only after a lengthy epoch of \ngovernment by the bourgeoisie. Its task would be \nto lay the fundaments of a democratic state structure in Russia; and it \nwould eventually be pushed aside, through the ballot box, by the \npolitical parties of the bourgeoisie. Immediately he was accused of offering a \n 130 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndisguised version of populism.45 \nThe webs spun by Parvus and Trotski momentarily encoiled Lenin.5o Lenin exhibited no knowledge \nof this. The Russian Marxist notion of the \ntwo-stage transition to socialism was not yet jettisoned. Lenin \nnonetheless argued that socialists should constitute the first temporary \ngovernment after the absolute monarchy's removal. Lenin maintained that, if the revolutionary \npotentiality of the peasants was to be realised, their political \nrepresentatives had to obtain a share in power. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party.51 \nLenin emphasised that his provisional revolutionary government \nwould not be introducing socialism. Russia was not yet \nripe for socialist revolution; and the socialist coalition presumably \nwould eventually lose power to other political parties as economic \nmodernisation was realised. \nHe and the Mensheviks referred Lenin to the decision of the Second \nInternational, taken in 1904, forbidding socialist parties to enter \ncoalition governments.54 Lenin had his reply to hand. The Russian provisional revolutionary govern-\nment's task would be entirely different. Lenin's revolu-\ntionary dictatorship, unbridled by legal constraints, would quickly \nbecome oppressive. The rural population would not voluntarily accept Bolshevik \nagrarian policy; and immense discontent would occur if the socialist \ncoalition was determined to carry out its policies.57 \nLenin had hoped to pre-empt such criticisms by enlarging the \nenticements to the peasantry in the party programme. In 1905, Lenin observed the countryside'S \nferment.58 And yet, far from reassuring the \nMensheviks, Lenin's proposals alarmed them. Under such a regime, asked Lenin, where \nwould counterrevolutionaries get the necessary backing to form an \narmy to destroy the democratic institutions created by the provisional \nrevolutionary government. It is difficult to judge who was more right, Lenin or \nMaslov. The \npolitical framework envisaged by Lenin in 1905 was destined never to \ncome into existence in precisely the shape described by him. The \nOctober Revolution of 1917 gave rise to policies which differed \nimportantly from Lenin's earlier projections. But Soviet rural history \nstill offers clues for the adjudication of the Lenin-Maslov controversy. \nThe Bolshevik government encountered stiff resistance when it \nintervened directly and heavily in the operations of the peasant \neconomy: the New Economic Policy of 1921 was a recognition by the \ngovernment that the peasants were intent upon ordering their \neconomic life as they saw fit. Lenin's writings in 1905 overestimated \nthe Russian peasantry's predisposition to welcome policies designed to \neffect rapid modernisation of agriculture. \nThe arrangements for the Congress were out of Lenin's hands. He steered the Congress away \nfrom allowing representation to Bolshevik splinter groups in cities \nwhere the legitimately-constituted committees favoured the Men-\nsheviks.6s Yet Krasin was not the \nonly delegate to express doubt that Russian workers acknowledged the \nnecessity of political revolution.6s Lenin was content.70 Lenin sided with Rumyantsev.71 \nOn the connected issue of participation in trade unions, Lenin went \neven further than Rumyantsev. Lenin wanted the party to start \nforming trade unions. Rumyantsev was unpersuaded; he retained that \nwidespread Bolshevik distaste for activity that appeared directed \ntowards non-political ends.72 The \nCongress's drafting commission overruled Lenin. Tskhakaya, in particular, contended \nthat the Russia of mid-1905 differed little from the Russia of 1902. \nLenin's first report to the Congress dealt with entrance into a \n'provisional revolutionary government'. Bolshevik policy was \ndesigned to prevent, not to engineer a Millerandist sell-out. Lenin went further. And indeed there was something akin to \nanticipatory relish in Lenin's further statement that the revolutionary \ndictatorship of the workers and the peasantry in Russia should \norganise its own terror. It may well be that Lenin was carried \naway in the heat of the moment, and that he revealed a policy which he \notherwise preferred to cosset with euphemisms.81 \nBolsheviks of all complexions anyway warmed to his speech; not a \nsingle delegate rose to oppose him. The Lenin-Krasin resolution won a massive majority. He omitted \n 136 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention of land nationalisation. \nLenin defended the formulation loyally at the Congress. \nVladimirov enquired where the party should in fact stop with its \nagrarian reforms.' was Lenin's response.86 Not for the \nonly time in 1905 the urge to move towards Trotski's 'permanent \nrevolution' showed itself in Lenin's reflex reactions.88 Lenin, however, sided with Bogdanov.89 True, Lenin and Bogdanov obtained the scrapping of \nMartov's definition of the terms of party membership in favour of \nLenin's;90 but their other recommendations encouraged a relaxation of \nhierarchical arrangements.92 \nLenin and Bogdanov, however, disagreed about the structure of the \ncentral party apparatus.93 They had had their \nfill of the emigre disputes of 1903-4; many hinted that Lenin had been \namong the most offenders. He objected to the growth of a cult around Lenin, \ndeclaring: 'I am not a Leninist, I'm a party activist, a revolutionary \nsocial-democrat, a Marxist.96 So as to prevent Lenin's total humiliation, \nDesnitski proposed a vote of thanks for V pered' s services to the party. 97 Lenin's contribution \nto party life was highly esteemed, but not regarded as being indispens-\nable. But this \nwas an all-Bolshevik affair. Lenin still exhibited fractiousness towards \nthose social-democrats not espousing Bolshevism. Equal impatience was \nshown to Lenin's motion to excoriate the Mensheviks as 'disorganis-\ners' who should be treated as 'standing outside the party' . Bogdanov sought the \nre-unification of the party, albeit a party united under Bolshevik \nleadership. He forced compromise upon Lenin.101 \nLenin had the sense to retreat with composure. There were four other members of this all-\nBolshevik body: Bogdanov, Krasin, Postolovski and Rykov.103 Each \nwas independently-minded and had a record of standing up to Lenin. \nAUTOCRACY IN RETREAT \nThird Congress delegates, when proceedings ended on 27 April 1905, \nfelt sure that political unrest in Russia was about to increase in \nseverity; the debates had put Lenin in closer touch with his native land, \nif only through the medium of activists who had journeyed thence to \nLondon.

The Soviet declined to advocate the pro-\ngramme of any single political party or group; it aimed, as a 'non-party \norganisation', to unite the capital's workers. The strikes were intended to achieve civic \nfreedoms as well as higher wages; the Petersburg Soviet's slogans \ncalled for the formation of a democratic republic. lo9 The Soviet \nintroduced its own administration, including a workers' militia. Trotski \nregretted that the Soviet could not manage to re-unite the social-\ndemocratic factions in the capital.

Delegates from Russia sided with Bogdanov. But this \nwas an all-Bolshevik affair. He forced compromise upon Lenin.

Nikolai II made concessions.", "Bolshevik_Policy_1905": " 7 Sturm und Drang \nBLOODY SUNDAY \nYet it was not only expatriate social-democrats like Lenin who were \ncaught unprepared by the political storms of 1905. All parties in \nRussia and in the emigration were astounded. \nSo it was in Russia on 9 January 1905. Petersburg. The brutality of the authorities \nwas notorious in the Russian empire; and yet until 9 January 1905 the \npopulation had generally absolved the monarchy of direct responsi-\nbility.7 \nEvents in Russia had their own momentum; the situation changed so \nfast that no emigre leader, not even an epistolary zealot such as Lenin, \ncould provide detailed advice to committees at home. \nLabour unrest was severe in Ivanovo-Voznesensk. Petersburg workers in autumn 1905 and given the name of \n'soviets' (or 'councils').8 Social-democrats, mostly Bolsheviks, led the \n 124 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIvanovo Assembly. But industrial conflict was pulling an increas-\ning number of social-democrats, both Mensheviks and Bolsheviks, into \nthe fray despite such inhibitions. The summer of 1905 witnessed \nfurther strikes and demonstrations in Tver, Lodz and Nizhni Nov-\ngorod.9 \nLenin had for years been preaching a fire sermon against tsarism; \nand his cursing of the government had been equalled in ferocity only by \nhis blackguarding of those revolutionaries who seemed to him to lack \nthe fullness of his own resolve to pull down the entire autocratic order. Liberals and socialist-\nrevolutionaries vied to put the peasant movement on a national basis. He and his wife hurried off to inform \nLenin and Krupskaya. But not to Lenin. 15 This reflected Lenin's wishes, not organisational \nactuality.'16 The Central Committee and Iskra, \nhe announced to Bolshevik comrades in Zurich on 5 January 1905, \nhad forfeited their claim to legitimate authority; by their own actions \nthey had 'placed themselves outside the party'.'17 \nThe recipients of his correspondence found no detailed explanation \nof his switching of tactics; he apparently assumed that Iskra's recent \narticles left the Bolsheviks no choice. She had always contended that such an \ninfringement would bring the Bolsheviks into unnecessarily bad \nodour; and the Bureau agreed with her. Lenin pooh-poohed such feelings as formalism.19 Lenin was enraged. Convinced that he had been improperly treated in \nsummer 1904, Lenin had broken off personal relations with Noskov.20 \nIt would be difficult for Lenin to dominate the central party apparatus if \nNoskov returned to the scene. Noskov's Bolshevik Conciliators would \ninsist that Mensheviks be allowed to be elected as Congress delegates.21 To Lenin's way of thinking, Menshevism was a \ncancer in the body pf the party: it had to be cut out immediately. \nLenin's one-mad proclamation of the parting of the ways was saluted \nby a number of Bolsheviks in Geneva and Zurich. Even Gusev, who until then had mirrored Lenin's \nideas, thought it wise to make an agreement with the Central \nCommittee about joint actions in St. Petersburg in December 1904. 24 Lenin \nreplied on 29 January 1905.'26 This \nwas wartime, Lenin declared.29 Lenin \nwould at last get his Congress. \nNot for the last time, his colleagues wrongly inferred that they had put \nan end to Lenin's disruptions. He genuinely believed, in so far as his inner \ncalculations may be assessed, that Menshevik strategy as it was \nevolving in the winter of 1904--5 constituted a menace to the prospects \nof successful revolution; he was therefore equally intent upon breaking \nwith any Bolsheviks like Noskov who refused to engage in uncondi-\ntional struggle with the Menshevik leaders. The point to be made is not \nthat Lenin was being fundamentally insincere. He failed to perceive the harm he \nmight be doing to the chances of amicable co-operation among \nBolsheviks of all shades; and this was all the more regrettable a failure \nsince he himself recognised that revolution was impossible without a \nlarge corps of experienced, militant activists.31 He also made it harder \nfor Mensheviks to come over to the Bolshevik side. Lenin's intemperate mode of behaviour \nharmed his own cause.33 \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'TWO TACTICS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY IN THE \nDEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION' \nEvidence for the authenticity of his belief in the imminence of \nrevolutionary upheaval is found in his theoretical writings. He had it quickly published \nand transported clandestinely to Russia; and the rapid approval of its \nstrategical outline by virtually every Bolshevik demonstrates his \ncontinuing popularity as a theorist even at a time when his prestige as a \npractical leader was entering a partial eclipse.35 No, said Lenin: the uprising \nhad to be planned and co-ordinated from above by the social-\ndemocratic party central leadership. \nAs soon as published, Lenin's words attracted a familiar accusation: \npopulism.3s Lenin's \nreply was caustic. The Russian \nbourgeoisie lacked not only the political will to destroy the autocracy \nbut also the social and economic power necessary for the governance \nof Russian society once the popular insurrection had occurred. It \nwould therefore fall to the Russian working class to carry out the \ndemocratic reforms vital to the reconstruction of state and society: \nworkers would carry through the democratic revolution. Did not their plans \ncontradict the Russian Marxist prognostication that a socialist revolu-\ntion could occur in any country only after a lengthy epoch of \ngovernment by the bourgeoisie. Immediately he was accused of offering a \n 130 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndisguised version of populism.45 \nThe webs spun by Parvus and Trotski momentarily encoiled Lenin.47 Lenin assured his follow-\ners: 'We shall not stop halfway.5o Lenin exhibited no knowledge \nof this. Two Tactics remained his doctrinal summary in \nmid-1905. The Russian Marxist notion of the \ntwo-stage transition to socialism was not yet jettisoned. Lenin maintained that, if the revolutionary \npotentiality of the peasants was to be realised, their political \nrepresentatives had to obtain a share in power. It \nwould achieve the reforms demanded by the Russian Social Demo-\ncratic Labour Party.51 \nLenin emphasised that his provisional revolutionary government \nwould not be introducing socialism. Russia was not yet \nripe for socialist revolution; and the socialist coalition presumably \nwould eventually lose power to other political parties as economic \nmodernisation was realised. \nHe and the Mensheviks referred Lenin to the decision of the Second \nInternational, taken in 1904, forbidding socialist parties to enter \ncoalition governments.54 Lenin had his reply to hand. The Russian provisional revolutionary govern-\nment's task would be entirely different. To the Mensheviks it mattered \nlittle that Lenin did not intend to decree instant socialism: Lenin's \nsubjective aims did not greatly bother them. Lenin's revolu-\ntionary dictatorship, unbridled by legal constraints, would quickly \nbecome oppressive. The rural population would not voluntarily accept Bolshevik \nagrarian policy; and immense discontent would occur if the socialist \ncoalition was determined to carry out its policies.57 \nLenin had hoped to pre-empt such criticisms by enlarging the \nenticements to the peasantry in the party programme. In 1905, Lenin observed the countryside'S \nferment.58 And yet, far from reassuring the \nMensheviks, Lenin's proposals alarmed them. Under such a regime, asked Lenin, where \nwould counterrevolutionaries get the necessary backing to form an \narmy to destroy the democratic institutions created by the provisional \nrevolutionary government.60 \nAs with so many other discussions inside the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party, the argument ultimately returned to the \nagrarian question. It is difficult to judge who was more right, Lenin or \nMaslov. The \npolitical framework envisaged by Lenin in 1905 was destined never to \ncome into existence in precisely the shape described by him. The \nOctober Revolution of 1917 gave rise to policies which differed \nimportantly from Lenin's earlier projections. But Soviet rural history \nstill offers clues for the adjudication of the Lenin-Maslov controversy. \nThe Bolshevik government encountered stiff resistance when it \nintervened directly and heavily in the operations of the peasant \neconomy: the New Economic Policy of 1921 was a recognition by the \ngovernment that the peasants were intent upon ordering their \neconomic life as they saw fit. Lenin's writings in 1905 overestimated \nthe Russian peasantry's predisposition to welcome policies designed to \neffect rapid modernisation of agriculture. \nThe arrangements for the Congress were out of Lenin's hands. He steered the Congress away \nfrom allowing representation to Bolshevik splinter groups in cities \nwhere the legitimately-constituted committees favoured the Men-\nsheviks. \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's mood, however, was buoyed up by the early broadly-based \nsupport he obtained for his call for a strategic offensive.6s Yet Krasin was not the \nonly delegate to express doubt that Russian workers acknowledged the \nnecessity of political revolution. Lenin found this acceptable: he and his \nassociates agreed to modify the motion.6s Lenin was content.70 Lenin sided with Rumyantsev.71 \nOn the connected issue of participation in trade unions, Lenin went \neven further than Rumyantsev. Lenin wanted the party to start \nforming trade unions. Rumyantsev was unpersuaded; he retained that \nwidespread Bolshevik distaste for activity that appeared directed \ntowards non-political ends.72 The \nCongress's drafting commission overruled Lenin. Tskhakaya, in particular, contended \nthat the Russia of mid-1905 differed little from the Russia of 1902.7s At all events the \ndiscussion had shown how far removed was Lenin from seeking the \neternal application of What Is To Be Done. \nLenin's first report to the Congress dealt with entrance into a \n'provisional revolutionary government'. Bolshevik policy was \ndesigned to prevent, not to engineer a Millerandist sell-out. Lenin went further.78 Lenin drew a veil, presumably consciously, over \nMarx's changeability. And indeed there was something akin to \nanticipatory relish in Lenin's further statement that the revolutionary \ndictatorship of the workers and the peasantry in Russia should \norganise its own terror. It may well be that Lenin was carried \naway in the heat of the moment, and that he revealed a policy which he \notherwise preferred to cosset with euphemisms.81 \nBolsheviks of all complexions anyway warmed to his speech; not a \nsingle delegate rose to oppose him. He put \nforward an amendment to Lenin's motion, but it was an amendment \nreadily accepted by Lenin. The Lenin-Krasin resolution won a massive majority. He omitted \n 136 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention of land nationalisation. \nLenin defended the formulation loyally at the Congress. \nVladimirov enquired where the party should in fact stop with its \nagrarian reforms.' was Lenin's response.86 Not for the \nonly time in 1905 the urge to move towards Trotski's 'permanent \nrevolution' showed itself in Lenin's reflex reactions.88 Lenin, however, sided with Bogdanov.89 True, Lenin and Bogdanov obtained the scrapping of \nMartov's definition of the terms of party membership in favour of \nLenin's;90 but their other recommendations encouraged a relaxation of \nhierarchical arrangements.92 \nLenin and Bogdanov, however, disagreed about the structure of the \ncentral party apparatus. But Lenin wanted to retain a bipartite arrangement whereby \nthe Central Committee was situated in Russia and the party newspaper \nin Switzerland; Bogdanov held that both should be based on Russian \nsoil.93 They had had their \nfill of the emigre disputes of 1903-4; many hinted that Lenin had been \namong the most offenders. He objected to the growth of a cult around Lenin, \ndeclaring: 'I am not a Leninist, I'm a party activist, a revolutionary \nsocial-democrat, a Marxist.96 So as to prevent Lenin's total humiliation, \nDesnitski proposed a vote of thanks for V pered' s services to the party. 97 Lenin's contribution \nto party life was highly esteemed, but not regarded as being indispens-\nable. But this \nwas an all-Bolshevik affair. Lenin still exhibited fractiousness towards \nthose social-democrats not espousing Bolshevism. Equal impatience was \nshown to Lenin's motion to excoriate the Mensheviks as 'disorganis-\ners' who should be treated as 'standing outside the party' . Bogdanov sought the \nre-unification of the party, albeit a party united under Bolshevik \nleadership. He forced compromise upon Lenin.101 \nLenin had the sense to retreat with composure. There were four other members of this all-\nBolshevik body: Bogdanov, Krasin, Postolovski and Rykov.103 Each \nwas independently-minded and had a record of standing up to Lenin. \nThere was little possibility of Lenin's railroading his policies through \nthe new central party apparatus in the months to come. \nAUTOCRACY IN RETREAT \nThird Congress delegates, when proceedings ended on 27 April 1905, \nfelt sure that political unrest in Russia was about to increase in \nseverity; the debates had put Lenin in closer touch with his native land, \nif only through the medium of activists who had journeyed thence to \nLondon. The Bolsheviks wanted insurrection. \nReturning to Geneva, Lenin still shared this optimistic ebullience. \n 138 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut gradually the news began to make him reconsider. \nIndustrial disputes occurred across central Russia. Petersburg. The Russian word means \nCouncil; and the Petersburg Soviet's original purpose was to provide \nleadership of the current wave of strikes in the capital. \nThe Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries \nwere invited to send activists to work in an advisory capacity inside the \nExecutive Committee. The Soviet declined to advocate the pro-\ngramme of any single political party or group; it aimed, as a 'non-party \norganisation', to unite the capital's workers. The strikes were intended to achieve civic \nfreedoms as well as higher wages; the Petersburg Soviet's slogans \ncalled for the formation of a democratic republic. lo9 The Soviet \nintroduced its own administration, including a workers' militia. Trotski \nregretted that the Soviet could not manage to re-unite the social-\ndemocratic factions in the capital. The Mensheviks collaborated with \nhim willingly, but the Bolsheviks baulked for a time at the Soviet's \ninsistence upon its 'non-party' status. Soviets were springing \nup in towns and cities; as many as fifty had established themselves by \nthe end of 1905. Bogdanov hastened back \ninto Russia in 1904.6 Lenin refused all \ninvitations to emulate their action. Petersburg.lO \nLenin was irate that no one had even asked his opinion. \nThey had plans, well before the Manifesto, to start a legal Bolshevik \nnewspaper based in Russia (and perhaps its creation would have \ncompelled Lenin to go back to St. Petersburg even if no Manifesto had \nbeen issued). But there was another Lenin \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \n(and many more besides). In the second half of 1905 it was this Lenin who \ncame to the fore. He now claimed, to Bogdanov's bemusement, to be \nquite unbothered by the prospect of joining up again with the \nMensheviks; he even chided those Bolsheviks who 'exaggerated' the \npoints of dispute between the two factions.15 Bogdanov too wanted to \nsecure Bolshevik dominance inside a re-unified social-democratic \nparty; but many local groups of Bolsheviks were destroying his \nbargaining position by recombining with Menshevik groups without \nthe Central Committee's permission.1S Lenin by contrast was almost benign. He conceded that the \nBolshevik Central Committee (as if he himself had played no role in \nthe matter) had in the past unfairly cashiered social-democratic \ncommittees led by Mensheviks. Lenin \nwanted to delay it until spring 1906; but he again noted ruefully that \nthe Central Committee had not invited his advice.1s He worried even \nmore about the attitude of many Bolsheviks to non-party working-\nclass organisations. Lenin did not endorse \ntheir general viewpoint any more than previously; but he shared the \npriority given by Martov and Akselrod to ensuring that social-\ndemocrats did not let other political parties dominate the organisations \nof the Russian labour movement.19 Lenin now welcomed the Men-\nsheviks in the party as a means of putting pressure on his own \nBolsheviks to bend more readily in his own direction of policy. Petersburg.21 He \nalready knew of the Petersburg Soviet. He brought with him a draft \narticle advocating Bolshevik participation, expecting to get it pub-\nlished in Novaya Zhizn. Bogdanov's policy \nhad been that the Central Committee should involve itself in the \n Predicting the Tide \n143 \nPetersburg Soviet only on condition that the Soviet accepted the \nsocial-democratic programme. The Soviet had predictably repudiated \nthis demand. The Central Committee had thereupon urged all \nBolsheviks to withdraw from the Soviet.24 It took weeks for Lenin to \nsoften this intransigence. It \ncould hardly have been otherwise; the Bolsheviks, if ever they were \ngoing to organise an insurrection, were bound to have to enter mass \nworking-class organisations. \nLenin himself, possibly under Central Committee pressure, attended \nthe Soviet only infrequently. Trotski's name, not Lenin's, \nwas on Petersburg workers' lips. \nON PHILOSOPHY AND ON THE SOVIETS \nLenin and Bogdanov announced their differences over soviets and \ntrade unions as being of secondary importance in the winter of 1905-6; \nthe overriding task was to prepare an uprising to instal a provisional \nrevolutionary government. This consensus fortified Lenin's factional \nloyalty. He, the founder of Bolshevism, knew \nscarcely any Bolshevik leader in st. \nLenin objected to Bogdanov's essential conception of Marxism. In epistemology, Lenin sided with \nPlekhanov. So far, \nBogdanov and Lenin were in agreement. Bogdanov linked their outlook with \nMarxism.37 \nNevertheless Lenin and Bogdanov concurred that philosophical \ndisagreements need not affect their political alliance.3S Lenin expressed outrage when Plekhanov \ndeclared that a causal link existed between Bogdanov's 'subjectivist' \nphilosophy and his 'voluntarist' pursuit of a revolutionary dictator-\nship.39 \nLenin was of the opinion, all the same, that Bogdanov lacked the \nintellectual flexibility appropriate to the politician. Free-ranging in philosophy, Bogdanov in 1905 \nwas dogmatic about the concept of the 'vanguard party'. If the soviets \nwould not accept leadership from the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party, he implied, then too bad for the soviets.40 And too bad \nalso for the workers who elected delegates to those same soviets. He \nwas as doctrinaire about this as any Bolshevik hardliner (even though \nsuch an attitude was not in fact a logically unavoidable conclusion to be \ndrawn from What Is To Be Done. Lenin's view, as sketched in \nNovember 1905 and elaborated in his 1906 pamphlet Victory of the \n Predicting the Tide \n145 \nKadets, was different: he wanted the soviets to act as 'the embryos of \nthe new revolutionary power' . The Petersburg Soviet should initiate the process \nby selecting representatives to announce themselves as 'the pro-\nvisional revolutionary government of all Russia' . The \nsoviet, he declared, was a 'fighting organisation for the attainment of \nspecific goals'. Lenin's reactions tugged him in opposing directions. Lenin, \nwho had once sung the praises of the 'professional revolutionary', \nwanted to fling open the gates of the party to ordinary, inexperienced \nworkers without a smattering of Marxist doctrine: all to prod the \ncommittees out of their 'inertia' .50 \nYet Lenin simultaneously repeated that the party alone was the re-\npository of revolutionary wisdom. \nOrganisational discipline too had to be preserved; and party com-\n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmittees should ensure that their activists in the soviets toed the party \nline.52 Lenin occasionally spoke as if it was a pity that Bolsheviks had to \njoin the soviets at all.53 \nConsequently Lenin, however far he swam out towards the notion \nthat the working class was Marxist by instinct, did not toss away his \nlifebelt of traditional Bolshevism; and, though he had pragmatic \nreasons for continuing with his overtures to the Mensheviks, he still \nalso conceived of Menshevism itself as an impractical strategy. He \ncensured Akselrod, Dan and Martov even though they were the party's \nonly theorists who produced articles which prefigured the emergence \nof the soviets in late 1905. Social-democrats should work to ensure \ntheir own election to the congress-cum-soviet.55 Whenever he read of \nsuch plans, Lenin returned to his centralist premises. Like Trotski, Lenin thought that the \n'democratic dictatorship' could be installed only by simultaneous \nprocesses of central direction and local self-organisation.56 \nFAILURE OF INSURRECTION \nIf Lenin's thinking in 1905 was more tension-laden than was custom-\nary even for him, it must be appreciated that Russian politics changed \nwith bewildering rapidity inside a few months. Lenin was an active politician, not an armchair commen-\ntator. Since Lenin was \nconcerned lest the Bolsheviks might float adrift of working-class \nopinion, it was natural for him to make a strong case for the instinctive \nvirtues of the factory labourer. \nBefore 1905 he had experienced small difficulty in communicating \npolicies to his Bolsheviks; but his editorial job in Novaya Zhizn, upon \nhis return to Russia, was in the gift of a Central Committee suspicious \nof his pro-soviet enthusiasms. Semen Shvarts \nwas then a Bolshevik agitator in the capital. Yet he knew nothing of Lenin's idiosyncratic stance in \nthe Central Committee (even though Shvarts himself much approved \nof participation in the soviets).58 Many Bolshevik committee-men at \nlower levels shared the Central Committee's distrust of non-party \norganisations. On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. Soviets should be treated \nmerely as 'the technical apparatus' for carrying the party's leadership \nto the working class. The months \nfrom October to December witnessed the entrance of Bolsheviks into \nmore mass organisations such as the trade unions and the soviets. They sought to use the soviets as a base \nfor propaganda in favour of armed insurrection. They helped in \nstrengthening the Moscow Soviet in December (which contrasted with \ntheir behaviour in St. The \nPetersburg Soviet called upon the people to withhold tax payments. \nThe Petersburg Soviet's life was ended as suddenly as it had begun.61 \nLenin's influence over events in St. The Moscow Bolsheviks, who held the party's city \ncommittee, decided to mount an insurrection before the authorities \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrepeated their attempt at suppressing revolutionary activity.62 The \nMoscow Soviet sanctioned the uprising. Lenin's doubts, expressed in early autumn, had proved \nwell-founded. Paradoxically it was the incautious policy which he and \nothers had urged on the party in spring 1905 that led to the disaster. \nTAMPERE AND THE DUMA \nWhile insurrection took place in Moscow, a Conference of Bolsheviks \nwas being held to the north. Petersburg.66 The crisis in Moscow led to a \nbreakdown of communications between Russia and Finland. Insurrection remained the Bolshevik \npriority.69 Initially there were two dissenters: Gorev and Lenin. They \nviewed a policy of boycott as yet another sign of the Bolsheviks' naive \ninflexibility. Lenin had dreaded this since summer. \nLenin's attitude was less rigid. Like all Bolsheviks, he denounced the \nlaw's provisions as a mockery of constitutionalism. Under the \ncover of this process, Lenin argued, it would be possible for workers to \nre-establish the soviets. Lenin continued to discuss the \nmatter with other delegates. He turned to Lenin for backing. Lenin \nsaid he had changed his mind.73 \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction. The secret \nof his alleged domination over all things Bolshevik, it was asserted, lay \npartly with his ability to beguile committee-men of inadequate formal \neducation. Undoubtedly Lenin deployed his erudition to advantage. \nMen of humble social origin were legion in the Bolshevik faction. Throughout his career as a party \nboss, Lenin had to take their feelings into account. The reporter was Lenin.77 Negotiations between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks followed \nhard on the Conference. Lenin and Martov were present.78 Lenin also loyally pressed the \nBolshevik argument for boycotting the Duma. \nIronically, he made a case not dissimilar from Lenin's earlier one: that \nthe Duma elections should be exploited as an instrument for revolu-\ntionary self-organisation by the working class. Bolshevik opposition, \nhowever, was strong; and the Mensheviks, being themselves suspicious \nabout the Duma, bowed to their arguments.79 \nOver the winter of 1905-6, however, the political situation in the \ncountry became clearer. The successful candidates, \nin order of popularity, were Plekhanov, Dan and Lenin. \nLenin's report proposed land nationalisation. Without fully abandoning this \nposition, Lenin now also contended that intervention and control by \ngovernment would powerfully increase the rate of economic change.88 Lenin's remark implied that \nPlekhanov had originally not opposed nationalisation. In any case Lenin himself could hardly claim \ncomplete consistency in policy.9o \nThe disagreement between Maslov and Lenin over agrarian policy \nreflected differing expectations about the post-tsarist Russian state.91 Lenin, as a Bolshevik, envisaged a \ndifferent scenario. Discussion \ncovered the entirety of Russian history. Russian \nfeudalism was a bastard variant.94 Lenin had challenged this view in the 1890s. Suddenly, a \ndecade later, his historiographical differences with Plekhanov were \nseen to underpin a question of enormous immediate relevance: what \nwas the nature of this tsarist state and how best could social-democrats \ndismantle it. This was that \n Predicting the Tide \n153 \nLenin, for all his agro-economic expertise, was unable to keep most \nBolsheviks with him. Suvorov, a Bolshevik who was politically and philosophically \nclose to Bogdanov, baulked at land nationalisation; instead he \nproposed a scheme which would designate all agricuituralland as the \nproperty of the peasantry. Such Bolsheviks considered it impossible to \nprevent the peasantry from appropriating whatever they wanted in the \ncountryside once the revolutionary conflagration had begun.98 Lenin \ncame some way to accommodating Suvorov's objection.99 But most Bolsheviks stayed \nwith Suvorov. And Lenin, thinking Suvorov's ideas to be incorrect but \nnot fundamentally damaging to Bolshevik strategy, voted in his \nsupport and against Maslov. Not only \ndoes it show us Lenin the practical politician under pressure to back \npolicies which were not entirely to his liking. It also reveals how, even \non a major question of policy such as land tenure, Lenin was not the \nmaster of the Bolshevik faction. And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from 1906, that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October 1917 by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions.lOl Bolshevik attitudes remained under fire. Already in the \nCongress, Lenin had been accused by Plekhanov of talking like a \nsocialist -revol utionary . Lenin's insurrectionism was said to have blinded him to \nother political opportunities. 103 This made painful listening for Lenin; \nit had been the Central Committee, not he, which had been reluctant to \nparticipate in the soviets in 1905. But Martynov's mistake also brought \nadvantages to Lenin. This was Akselrod's \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreport on the Duma.l04 Lenin led off for the Bolsheviks in reply. He retained reservations about Bolshevik policy; \nbut factional ties prevented him from stating them openly. He stated that he did not hold comrade Lenin exclusively to \nblame for the party's past troubles.llo \nLenin accepted the result with equanimity.lll He also \nannounced that he did not believe that Bolsheviks and Mensheviks \ncould not work together in the same party. They spoke against the \narmed robberies that the Bolsheviks had undertaken to increase their \nfaction's treasury.ll4 Lenin's support for such 'expropriations' was \nwell-known. Unlike the majority of Bolsheviks present, Lenin sided with \nthe Mensheviks. Negotiations evinced an accord to include seven Men-\nsheviks and three Bolsheviks in the Central Committee. Lenin was not \namong them. The Bolsheviks chosen were Desnitski, Krasin and \nRykov (who was to be replaced by Bogdanov upon his release from \nprison). It was possibly a signal from his factional associates that he and \nhis close supporters had moved too far away from their line of policy; \nbut they cannot have felt extremely strongly about this since he \ncontinued for the rest of 1906 to assume a leading position, alongside \nBogdanov and Krasin, in Bolshevik discussions. His energies were to be reserved for his widely-acknowledged \nspecialism: editing Bolshevik newspapers and other publications.119 \nAt any rate, the entire Bolshevik leadership was at least agreed on the \nneed to maintain an autonomous factional central apparatus inside the \nformally re-united party. A Bolshevik Centre was secretly established. \nLenin found the Congress less gratifying.", "Bolshevik_Policy_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.3 Lenin concluded: 'All hopes of a peaceful development of the \nRussian revolution have disappeared definitively.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. Representatives of the \nparty's localleaderships of Moscow and Petrograd as well as Central \nBureau of the Military Organisation also attended. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.', according to Ordzhoni-\nkidze's later account, Lenin let it be known that the factory-\nworkshop c9mmittees could provide the institutional base for the \nforthcoming socialist administration.6 Even the April Party Confer-\nence had given no absolute commitment to rule by soviets;7 and in \nThe State and Revolution, written in the months after the July Days, \nLenin had barely mentioned the soviets. Only Sverdlov fully accepted Lenin's view-\npoint immediately after the July Days.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. In addition, the party had \ninvested its energies in persuading workers that 'soviet power' was \nthe noblest objective; and the practical difficulties of justifying \nLenin's proposed change of slogans, when Bolshevik activists spoke \nat open mass meetings, would be considerable. 10 \nLenin wrote a short article, 'On Slogans', in reply and condemned \nthe Central Committee for what he saw as a lack of tactical \nflexibility.\" 'On Slogans' was published by the Kronstadt \nBolsheviks, and reached a number of activists in the provinces. 12 \nLenin's efforts did not go unrewarded; and a shift towards his stance \nhad in any case been occurring in the Central Committee even before \n The Fire Next Time \n203 \n'On Slogans' became widely known.14 Yet he affirmed that the ultimate objective remained the same: \nnamely to establish a socialist administration of soviets. Stalin added: \n'We are unequivocally in favour of those soviets where we have a \nmajority, and we shall try to set up such soviets. 16 \nYet Lenin's fortunes were not as bad as they seemed.' 17 Thus he made clear that his rejection of the \nsoviets was not to be regarded as permanent. Perhaps this clarifica-\ntion (or modification, if Ordzhonikidze's statement in his memoirs \nabout the factory-workshop committees is to be believed)18 nudged \nStalin and the Central Committee majority towards accepting that \nLenin's hostility to the 'All Power to the Soviets. Lenin's Bolshevik critics may also \nhave been reassured to note that he acknowledged that an immediate \ninsurrection was impracticable.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets.20 Lenin and Zinoviev could not risk the journey; \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Trotski, Lunacharski and Kamenev were in prison.21 \nThe decree was not unwelcome to Lenin inasmuch as it dissuaded \nBolshevik critics from continuing to demand that he should deliver \nhimself up to the authorities. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. His \nmain aim was to show that the Bolshevik leadership had not \nprovoked the clashes on the streets of the capital in early July. Vasilev \ncomplained that the party's agrarian policy was still so vague that the \nBolsheviks were failing to win support among peasants. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. In such a \ncontingency, according to Bukharin, the Bolsheviks would have to \nfight a defensive revolutionary war against the Germans. Kharitonov objected to the tendency in Bukharin's draft \nresolution to treat the European political situation as a uniform \nwhole and to play down the peculiar opportunities afforded in \nRussia; he also pointed out that, so far from there being certainty \nthat socialist governments would be established in the West, the war \nmight end with 'an imperialist peace'.34 Lenin, while sharing Osinski's concern intellectually, \nwould surely have approved of Bukharin's tactful reticence. He mentioned that 'certain comrades' still believed \ni~ to be 'utopian to raise the ,question of socialist revolution' in \nRussia. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. Whereas Lenin had held forth about the era of \nimperialism and the imminence of European socialist revolution, \nStalin addressed the specificity of Russia. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed. \nEven Stalin's cautious arguments for a socialist take-over were \nresisted by N. Angarski, a delegate from Moscow province, who had \ncriticised Lenin at the April Party Conference and who still \nadvocated a return to pre-1917 Bolshevik tenets. Stalin \nread out the Central Committee's motion 'on the political situation', \nwhich called for the abandoning of 'All Power to the Soviets. \nDzhaparidze for ignoring the prospect of socialist revolution in the \n 1.

(above) Lenin goes for a stroll in Moscow, Spring 1918. Molotov got to the root of the matter with a statement that \nwas vintage Lenin: 'It is necessary to point out the path for the \ntaking of power into our hands: that is the basic problem. A \nsocialist admini .48 In the meantime Russia was 'on the eve of \nfamine'. Osinski wanted more fundamental reforms; and yet he \n~lso objected to the slogan of governmental control over production \nsince such control would be dangerous if exercised not by the \nBolsheviks but by Kerenski. '52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential. Preobrazhenski wanted to \nspecify that the movement towards socialism in Russia was \ndependent on 'proletarian revolution in the West'. Stalin, with the \nCongress behind him, retorted that such an idea underestimated what \ncould be achieved in Russia on the country's own resources. Stalin's later advocacy of 'socialism in one country' was being \nbroached in a sketchy manner even before the October Revolution. Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. Trotski, who had only recently become a \nBolshevik, now joined the central party leadership. The Bolshevik right, which had been strongly represented in \nthe central party body after the Seventh Conference in April, had lost \nground. As Lenin put his thoughts in order for a seizure \nof power and for a programme of social and economic reforms, he \ncould look to a more receptive set of colleagues than he had \npossessed since entering the politics of Russian Marxism. \nKERENSKI AND KORNILOV \nDespite the dispute over slogans, no Bolshevik at the Congress gave \nthe impression of expecting to take power in the immediate future. If \nLenin had been there, things might have been different. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. For Lenin, this proved conclusively that \nthe Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were collaborating \nwith the forces of counter-revolution.64 Kerenski's policies, even \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthough Lenin exaggerated, undoubtedly moved rightwards. In foreign policy, the Allies were told that the Russian \ncommitment to winning the War was undiminished.66 \nKerenski, as Lenin continually asserted, relied on military support \nto reimpose the cabinet's will in Petrograd. The sole major omission from the list of \nparticipants was the Bolshevik party. The fate \nof both the cabinet and the soviets hung in the balance.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. A counter-\nrevolutionary mutiny had restored them to free activity in the \ncapital; the sole major Bolshevik who could not afford to appear \nin the open was Lenin.70 \nLenin, analysing the events as reported in the press, swung between \ninterpretations. Lenin's claim that \nMilyukov colluded with the Kornilov revolt has not been corro-\nborated; 72 but it was widely believed that he expected a coup and \nwould give it his approval. Accordingly, Kerenski badly \n11eeded to mend his fences with the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries in the soviets. The rising influence of the Mensheviks and \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries induced even Lenin to raise, on 1 \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSeptember, the question of whether a peaceful development of the \nrevolution was possible. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 73 \nLenin noted that peaceful revolutions, while being rare, were not \ninconceivable. 74 \nIt was an intriguing phase in Lenin's career. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. By 12 September \nhe was writing 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power' and demanded an \nimmediate uprising; and, on 14 September, he repeated this call in \n'Marxism and Insurrection';77 both documents were letters addressed \nto the Central Committee. Thus the 'peaceful \ndevelopment' of the revolution sketched by Lenin would have started \nonly after a violent phase had been endured. His \nfirst justification was that both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets \nhad acquired Bolshevik working majorities earlier in the month.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.82 Kamenev and Trotski, who had both been released \nfrom prison, were nominated as Bolshevik spokesmen and required \nto demand the removal of Kerenski and the installation of a \ngovernment composed entirely of socialists.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Trotski, too, was \nmoving towards such a standpoint and earned a plaudit from Lenin \nfor the taunts he flung at the non-Bolshevik socialists at the \nDemocratic Conference: 'Bravo, comrade Trotski.'84 But even \nTrotski believed that insurrection could not immediately be under-\ntaken, and the Central Committee as a whole resisted Lenin's \nproposal. It \nwas as if Lenin had been the boss of a gang intent on robbing a bank \nwho had incautiously confided his intentions to paper - his fellow \ngang-members wished to destroy the incriminating evidence.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Martov and the \nMenshevik-lnternationalists and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nhad already moved towards accepting the need for an exclusively \nsocialist government to be formed. Through the first weeks of October there was a series of \nvictories for the Bolsheviks in elections to the various mass \norganisations. Soviets, trade unions and factory-workshop commit-\ntees were falling into their control.92 \nTo be sure, these pro-Bolshevik voters were not wholly conscious \nof the nature of Bolshevism; and, outside Russia and the Russian-\ndominated cities in the peripheral regions of the old empire, direct \nsupport for the party was minuscule. Lenin's affirmation that 'the \nmajority of the people' favoured the Bolsheviks lacked cogency. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. \nLenin's insistence that time was not on the side of the Bolshevik \nparty is therefore hard to explain. \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin suggested that a further Kornilovite coup attempt could be in \nthe offing; he also maintained that Kerenski would deliberately hand \nthe country over to the Germans. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. \n'THE STATE AND REVOLUTION' \nLenin's hardheaded campaign for what he saw as his party's interests \nwas one aspect of a multifaceted political personality. The State and \nRevolution was the most refined embodiment of Lenin's strategy for \nthe carrying through of a socialist transformation in modern \nindustrial societies. The contents \namounted to a co-ordination and explication of the textual data \ncollected in the notes on Marxism and the state taken before the \nFebruary Revolution. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917.98 \nLenin's second chapter discussed the viewpoint of Marx and \nEngels on the revolutionary upsurge across Europe in 1848-51. Lenin retailed the characteristics approved by Marx. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. \nInstead, he wanted a 'working corporation', and Lenin perceived this \nfundamentally as a plea for mass participation in public life. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. 106 By \nany standard this was hyper-confidence; the return to Russia in 1917 \nhad reinforced his sanguine earlier hopes as articulated in 'Marxism \non the State'. Lenin noted the Anti-Diihring's notion that the state \nwould eventually 'wither away'. The ultimate Marxist \nobjective was a state-free society; but Lenin maintained that the \ntransition from capitalism to communism required an intermediate \nstage of socialism which would be inaugurated by the formation of a \nsocialist state: the dictatorship of the proletariat. 110 \nAs a Marxist, Lenin wanted to examine 'the economic founda-\ntions' for this withering away. \nLenin's allegations of financial corruption and political manipulative-\nness were cogent; and an ampler indication of the collusion between \ngovernmental ministers, industrial magnates and press barons would \nhave bolstered his case considerably. But Lenin was writing for \nMarxists, who needed no persuasion on such issues. 114 According to Lenin, Kautsky had \nP. This \nnaturally raised the question of why Lenin had not criticised such \nalleged neglect before 1914. Lenin replied that Kautsky had at least \nadhered to basic Marxist standpoints until 1914, particularly the idea \nthat 'the revolutionary era was beginning' (which appeared in The \nPath To Power in 1909).118 This was a reference to the absence of a description of the \n'dictatorship of the proletariat' in general and the soviets in \nparticular. It also made Lenin's State and Revolution seem more \noriginal than it was. Bukharin's name was not mentioned even \nthough his wartime reconsiderations of Marxism had been influen-\ntial in leading Lenin to the basis of his new contentions.'2\u00b0 Non-Bolsheviks felt no such \ninhibition. Kautsky and Martov attacked the book robustly; their \nremarks were all the more interesting inasmuch as both were \nMarxists and shared many of Lenin's intellectual premises.124 \nMartov's examination of such texts matched Lenin in exegetical \nskill. Martov delighted in exposing Lenin's sleights of hand. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. Indeed, Lenin saw himself as offering a vision \nof a totally harmonious and self-regulating society which was \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrealisable within a not too lengthy period; and he anticipated a more \nor less easy, trouble-free socialist revolution. 133 \nHis non-Bolshevik critics, however, did not limit themselves to \nMarxology. Moreover, Lenin's \ntwo antagonists did not share the unargued premise of his book that \neach class would gravitate permanently towards support for a single \nparty. The State and Revolution did not mention parties at all; and \nKautsky and Martov were introducing data from 1918, when a one-\nparty state became an enduring phenomenon in Russia. 139 \nLenin very probably had no conscious intention that a socialist \ndictatorship should undertake a large-scale and bloody repression; \nbut this only serves to demonstrate the facile quality of his thinking: \nthe objective likelihood of such a dictatorship having to turn to \nterrorist methods in order to sustain its power was strong. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Lenin failed, for \nexample, to explain how the local soviets would interact with central \nsoviet organs after the revolution. 141 This is not to claim that Western parliamentary \ndemocracies always embody a just and efficient system of rule in \nevery way; but the point at issue is that Lenin's alternative does not \nseem inherently more just or more efficient even from a theoretical \nstandpoint. \nIt is not sensible to assume, as Lenin did, that administrators can \nbe prevented from forming themselves into a corporate group (or \ninto groups) simply by insisting on electivity, on the right of instant \nrecall and on payment at a worker's rate. Kautsky put it in a nutshell when he retortc;d to Lenin that \nclasses can rule but cannot govern; and that mass participatory \nqemocracy is utopian. Yet what \nwas the relationship between such theory and subsequent Russian \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhistory. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Lenin's offering was a strange \nconcoction. Russia was not the exclusive \nfocus; and, when he started taking notes on socialist revolution in \nJanuary 1917, Lenin must have had Germany more firmly in mind \nthan his native land. Lenin did not specifically \nstate that his book was intended as a blueprint for the immediate \nfuture of Russian politics (even though many scholars have treated it \nsimply as such). All therefore knew of Lenin's \nintentions with the utmost clarity. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. \nHe knew only too well that the old Russian empire's population \nwas constituted predominantly by peasants, and wished as a Marxist \ntheorist to take account of the fact. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 153 But there was \nno fixed terminological pattern, and Lenin sometimes reverted to the \nformulas he had evolved in the spring. 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. The second \npoint is that Lenin apparently made only eight explicit references to \ndictatorship from the start of September through to 25 October159 -\nnot a enormous number in view of the topic's importance. \nIn addition, all those references occurred in the carefully-composed \nprose of Bolshevik newspaper articles and pamphlets. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Yet the result was that the great mass of workers and \npeasants outside the Bolshevik party can scarcely have known about \nhis full range of plans. This can hardly have been fortuitous; Lenin \ncannot have wanted to upset popular sensibilities unnecessarily, and \nthe virtues of dictatorship would not automatically have commended \nthemselves to the Russian working class. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. And so, whereas the general population - probably \nincluding most rank-and-file Bolsheviks- was unaware of his fiercer \nintentions, careful and regular readers should have picked up the \nmessage. 166 \nLenin, indeed, did not stop short of anticipating the use of 'terror' \nin Russia. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Lenin wanted the \nlaw changed so that 'the exploiters (i.' Strictly speaking, Lenin's plan for \ndifferential legislation on capital punishment did not involve \narbitrary violence; he wanted capitalists executed for specific \noffences, not just because they were capitalists. For most of the year, however, he preferred to avoid the \ntopic altogether or to concentrate on what he described as the terror \nbeing perpetrated against the Bolsheviks by the Provisional Govern-\nment. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. 178 And yet even from September, when he ceased to \ndemand the slogan's withdrawal, he offered no depiction of the \nfuture institutional framework of governance by soviets. His attitude \nto the alliance between workers and peasants in the soviets displayed \na particularly weak belief in democratic procedures. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. He omitted to \nsay what he would do if this vanguard were to turn against the \nBolsheviks and favour other parties; he had developed no ideas of \nmulti-party competition. \nNATIONALITY PROJECTS \nLenin beat the drum about the struggle for political revolution, \nsummoning workers, peasants and soldiers to overthrow the Provi-\nsional Government; but the rhythms of the national question were \nnot forgotten by him. The Provisional Government \nand its Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary supporters were \nfearful lest the Bolsheviks should take advantage of its difficulties \n The Fire Next Time \n229 \nwith some of the non-Russian nationalities. Such conflict \nwas grist in Lenin's mill, and after the Seventh Bolshevik Party \nConference he continued to demand that all nations in the old \nRussian empire should be accorded the right of secession. 180 It \nremained his argument that socialists, by advocating the right of \nsecession, would earn the trust of the non-Russians and thereby \npersuade them to stay within or to rejoin a multinational state which \nincluded the Russian people. 182 The \nfact that neither Finns nor Ukrainians were currently striving for \ncomplete independence bolstered Lenin's case against his party's left \nwing, that his talk of the right of secession was a danger to the \nformation of a large socialist state in the old Russian empire. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. But \naccount should also be taken that, in terms of ideas, Lenin's \nproposed solution of the national question within a unitary state \nhad much in common with Semkovski's. Lenin too called for 'broad \nregional autonomy' in areas populated by a large non-Russian nation \nand for schooling to take place in the native language. 192 The crucial \ndifference was that Lenin entirely refused to consider Semkovski's \narguments on ethnic intermingling (and it was only after the October \nRevolution that he began to face up to the problem). 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. 196 \nAnd yet we should be wary of assuming that even Lenin made \nnational self-determination into a prominently visible plank in his \nplatform. In his pre-October \npublications of 1917, he composed only three short articles on \nfuture national and ethnic policy. \nPerhaps he was too busy with other questions; but this can hardly \nhave been the main reason inasmuch as, until April 1917, he had \nmade so much fuss about national self-determination. Possibly he \nrecognised that the future boundaries of the old imperial state were \nbeyond prediction and that emphatic talk by Bolsheviks about the \nright of secession might induce more secessions than would otherwise \noccur: he explicitly avoided offering a set of 'demands' on behalf of \nspecific nationalities. Leading Bolsheviks privately asked him to \nclarify his policy; but he argued that it was more advisable to limit \nthe party's pronouncements to a simple 'declaration of principles' \n(and even then he published this prevaricatory remark not in a mass-\ncirculation newspaper or at an open mass meeting but in the low-\ncirculation 'thick journal' Enlightenment, which was read mainly by \nBolshevik intellectuals).201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917.202 \nLenin probably considered the matter as being less immediately \ncritical than he had earlier imagined. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. And, even where the Provisional Government \nfaced troubles in non-Russian areas, the underlying problems were \ncharacteristically economic and social in nature.204 It was wiser to \nleave the non-Russian areas to stoke up their own anger against the \nProvisional Government and to await further developments. Lenin \ndid precisely that. All Bolsheviks saw that the \neconomy's rapid deterioration was a crucial issue in the struggle \namong the political parties, and Lenin was his party's major \neconomic spokesman. He got down to elaborating his ideas from \nearly summer 1917. Newspapers across the spectrum of Russian \npublic opinion were talking of an inevitable catastrophe. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint. He did \nnot abandon this approach in 1917, at least not entirely; but he \nshifted his emphasis towards moral condemnation (even though, \nsince the 1890s, he had identified such condemnations as being the \ndefect of Russian agrarian-socialist thought).206 Lenin railed against \nthe greed and selfishness of businessmen. \nLenin even asserted that the economic crisis was quickly soluble. His \n The Fire Next Time \n233 \nwritings contrasted with those of Bolshevik economists such as V. 208 Lenin retorted that the \ncountry abounded in food, coal, oil and metal and confronted fewer \nobjective difficulties than did Germany. In \nfairness to him, it must be said that his criticism of Russian \ncontemporary commentators who had ignored this ph~nomenon \nhad had a great deal of cogency in 1915-16; but the crippling \nstrains on industry and commerce in 1917, especially from mid-\nsummer, were unmistakable to all who experienced them.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans. Lenin urged the idea's dissemination and implementa-\ntion across the country and throughout all major industrial \nsyndicates and banking institutions.214 Lenin's intention was for \nwage-earners to supervise owners and managers. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin. 218 \nThis concorded with his more optimistic views on the extent of global \ncapitalist development already achieved and on the speed which \ncould characterise the inception of socialism in Russia as well as in \nEurope in general.219 \nLenin was more cautious. In May 1917 he wrote about the \ndesirability of governmental control 'over the trusts, over the \nbanks, over trade, over the \"parasites\" . 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. Lenin seldom forgot his \nduties as chief of a political party. 224 \n The Fire Next Time \n235 \nOther proposals put forward by Lenin included progressive \ntaxation on incomes and property; compulsory publication of \nshareholdings of over 5000 roubles; universal labour duty, which \nwould mean that those who did not work would not eat either. Lenin may have been cautious by Bukharin's \nstandards, if not by Milyutin's, and even stood towards the right of \nBolshevik economic thought in 1917; but he still occupied a spot on \nthe extreme left of the spectrum of Russian economic proposals \noutside his party. In May 1917 he mentioned that, with \nthe anticipated rapid ending of the war, there would be a demilitar-\nisation of industrial production. Ilin' (Lenin's pseudonym as author of The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia in 1899) had focused on the \nintimate relationship between the respective advances of agriculture \nand industry. \nFurthermore, there was no originality in Lenin's points about \ndemilitarisation. There he had repeated his argument \nthat a simple transfer of the land into the hands of the peasantry as a \nwhole would not help the village poor, who lacked the equipment, \n 236 \nLenin: A Political L((e \nlivestock and finances to farm independently: he was continuing to \nappeal mainly to the poorest section of the peasantry.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy. Not enough is known about the \ndebates behind closed doors to allow us to say why Lenin altered his \nstance; but probably either the Central Committee forced him or he \nindependently took cognisance that nationalisation would not prove \nattractive to the peasants. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. Two hundred and forty-two 'peasant instructions' had \nbeen collated, and Lenin urged that the party accept them as the \nbasis of the Bolshevik party's policy.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers.240 Lenin's change of policy meant \nthat he was taking up the Socialist-Revolutionary agrarian pro-\ngramme. On the contrary, he thought that, despite what \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries expected, their policy would in effect \npreside over capitalism in the countryside.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation.245 \nLenin enjoyed the discomfiture of his opponents, and was not at all \ndisconcerted by the accusation that he had stolen another party's \npolicy. He wanted power for himself and his party, and he wanted \nthis power to be directed at the eventual attainment of socialism in \nRussia and Europe. The result was not intellectual coherence; indeed, \nthe switch from policies aimed at workers and the poorest peasants \nto policies aimed at workers and the entire peasantry destroyed a \npillar in the edifice of his strategy as announced in April 1917. \nThis was an engaging and even endearing characteristic; but it also \nshowed a casualness and, for a theoretician who had castigated all \nand sundry for their weaknesses of analysis and anticipation, an \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhypocrisy and irresponsibility. Lenin's self-awareness was not great. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader. The scent of real power grew stronger, and \nLenin's excitement at his opportunity intensified. 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. If these \ndifficulties are large in the late twentieth century, when the \n239 \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \ninstruments of the mass media are profusely available to political \nleaders, they were still larger in earlier decades. \nLenin's opponents, at the time and afterwards, focused upon his \ndelight in manipulative politics. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. In the committees of the \nparty there was greater awareness, and Lenin needed to express \nhimself more sophisticatedly among activists and leaders in Petro-\ngrad. Whether in a treatise like \nThe State and Revolution, or in a mass-circulation newspaper article, \nor at an open-air workers' gathering, or in a Central Committee \nclosed session, or even merely in a jotted note which remained \nunpublished until after his death (and such notes elucidate vital \naspects of his career): all his pronouncements must be analysed in the \nlight of the prevailing circumstances and of the specific objectives \npursued by Lenin at the time. Ambiguity and \ninchoateness proliferated, but this partly derived from the reluctance \nof Lenin and other Bolsheviks to analyse developments in other \ncountries in much detail. Strictly speaking, Lenin had no 'foreign \n To All the Peoples \n241 \npolicy'. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own. In addition, the Bolshevik outlook was orientated upon \nclasses rather than upon political elites.5 Lenin had asserted that \nclass-based struggle across Europe was desirable.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution.8 \nLenin was preoccupied by the search for signs of discontent in \nfactories and barracks in Germany. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 10 The \nBolshevik central newspaper kept a steady eye on such events as they \nbecame public news. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. Lenin can \nscarcely be faulted for acting on the premise that the public record \nunderstated the continental tumult. \nNeither he nor his Bolshevik colleagues provided serious commen-\ntary upon the German submarine attacks on American shipping, or \nthe ensuing entry of the USA into the war on the side of the Allies. \nLenin barely bothered to follow the changing fortunes of the armies \nlocked in battle on the Eastern and Western fronts. \n To All the Peoples \n243 \nWriters in the non-Bolshevik Russian press perceived these events \nas having a cardinal significance. 17 And yet not once did Lenin \nmention Michaelis by name. 19 \nMenshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary and Kadet commentators inter-\npreted Lenin's attitude in two ways: either Lenin lacked all trace of \nmilitary and political realism, or else his zeal to pull Russia out of the \nWar was so overpowering that he would sign a separate treaty with \nthe Germans. Calls \nby him and other Bolshevik Central Committee members for \n'fraternisation' between Russian and German soldiers corroborated \nthis dual conclusion among his enemies. 21 \nAnd so Lenin was obliged to enunciate what he would do if, \nshould he come to power, a European socialist revolution failed to \nensue. His usual gambit was to brush the matter aside by contending \nthat the Bolsheviks, simply by proposing a 'democratic peace' and \npublishing the secret treaties, would stimulate popular insurrections \nin Europe. Lenin proclaimed that the chances of success were '99 to \nI 00'. 22 His confidence was enhanced by the precedent of the Russian \nnear-revolution of 1905-6, when rebels in Asia and Europe had been \ninspired to demand democratic reforms. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 24 References by him and by Stalin to the importance of non-\nEuropean nationalism marked them off from several other leading \nBolshevik strategists. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war. were \nto place us in the situation of a revolutionary war', the Bolsheviks \nwould not refuse the challenge;29 and in his second speech five days \nlater he announced that 'in certain circumstances we cannot get by \nwithout revolutionary war'. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Lenin's statements \nimplied that the Bolsheviks would fight only if circumstances forced \ntheir hand; and he eschewed any indication about the timing of such \na war. 33 In the second place, the circumstances of Lenin's remarks \ndeserve scrutiny. His Pravda articles and his speeches to the First \nSoviet Congress were framed as a response to the allegations that the \nBolsheviks would sign a separate treaty with Germany. \nConsequently, most Bolsheviks did not know that 'revolutionary \nwar' had ever been among Lenin's proposals.36 Lenin's journalism and \n To All the Peoples \n245 \nopen speech-making gave an ever-diminishing impression of a man \nwho contemplated the renewal of the war even as a contingency plan. Possibly Lenin recognised that his party's popularity lay in \nits promise to end the war, and that even a conditional prospect of \ncontinuing with the fighting would be unattractive. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Before 1917, Bukharin and Trotski objected to Lenin's \ndismissiveness towards the European peace movement. 39 The inclina-\ntion to talk about peace and play down the theme of a possible \nrevolutionary war grew stronger after the February Revolution, and \nLenin followed rather than led his colleagues in this.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. There can be no definitive answer; but it is not \ninconceivable that, when writing privately in favour of revolutionary \nwar, he was not revealing his genuine intentions but felt that the time \nhad not yet arrived to convince his colleagues, especially those on the \nleft wing of the Bolshevik party, of the impracticability of prolonging \nmilitary engagement. \nIndeed, it may be wrong to assume that Lenin really had a firm \nand considered attitude to 'revolutionary war' in these months. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917.46 \nLenin's reasons for changing his emphasis are unclear.48 He may also have sensed that his \npolemics against the Provisional Government would be more biting if \nthe specifically Russian dimensions of governmental problems were \npin-pointed by the Bolsheviks. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment. He was right to declare that the controls over \ncapitalism introduced by Menshevik ministers in summer 1917 were \nineffectual, and that the concessions on the land question extracted \nfrom the Cabinet by the Socialist Revolutionaries did not radically \nalter the rural economic order.50 \nNone the less Lenin's thinking had its incoherences as well as its \nexaggerations. And he could perceive that it would do the Bolsheviks \nno harm if they put themselves forward as better protectors of the \nnational interest than were the Kadets, the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. 53 At any \nrate Lenin disowned the aim of seeking the dissolution of the Russian \narmed forces. Lenin, the \nunbending internationalist and harrier of all professed patriots, was \nsimultaneously standing forward as the only sure defender of Mother \nRussia. The German military danger, Kerenski's alleged \ntreason and the need to keep the Russian army in operational order \nwere themes helping to repudiate the accusation that Lenin and other \nBolshevik leaders were German agents. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. The main accusers in the press, \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nVladimir Burtsev and Grigori Aleksinski, stated that Lenin had met \nup with Parvus on his trip back from Switzerland. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Aleksinski published a recorded list of \ntelegrams which had passed between Lenin (or other members of \nthe Ulyanov family in Petrograd) and Bolshevik representatives such \nas Hanecki, Radek and M. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry. 57 \nCertainly, German diplomacy had an interest in looking favour-\nably upon the party of Lenin. Bolshevik propaganda about peace \nassisted in increasing Russian weariness with the war; and politicians \nin Berlin knew that if the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, at the \nvery least a truce could be arranged on the Eastern front. Their contention, expressed in a series of \nformal statements from April to July, was that personal defamation \nwas being used as a means of achieving the annihilation of the \nBolshevik party. Lenin's training in jurisprudence \nmade him reply to it cautiously. And yet it does not amount to a refutation of the charge \nthat the Bolshevik Central Committee frequently and knowingly \nreceived donations from the German government.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them. \nNo moral considerations inhibited the Bolshevik Central Commit-\ntee from receiving a subsidy from anyone at all. Lenin took Plekhanov's \nremark at the Second Party Congress as his guideline that the only \nquestion to be asked about any policy was whether it helped the \nprospects of revolution. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy.67 Lenin's principles allowed him to receive subventions \nfrom a 'bourgeois government' with equanimity. The fact that the \ngovernment offering the funds in 1917 was at war with the \ngovernment of one's own country was a matter of indifference for \nhim.f both the Russian and German governments; and that the German \nauthorities' recklessness in assisting the Bolsheviks financially would \nnot alter his commitment to the strategy. Kerenski would treat the receipt of such monies \nby the Bolsheviks as high treason, and most Russian citizens would \nhave sympathised with Kerenski's assessment. Trial and even \nexecution of Lenin might easily follow. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection. 69 \nLenin consequently had every stimulus to keep quiet about the \nfinancial arrangements. \nSuch Bolsheviks were almost certainly unaware that much dirt might \nhave come out in the wash of a public trial. 70 \nYet account needs to be taken that German financial subventions \nwere not unique to the Bolsheviks.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). Attempts \nwere apparently made to do the same with non-Russian nationalists \nin the Russian empire. \nAnd yet Aleksinski and his friends, as well as their successors since \nthe Second World War, did not merely state that the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee received 'German gold'; they asserted that the \nfunds from Berlin were indispensable for the Bolshevik political \nadvance in 1917.74 \n To All the Peoples \n251 \nAleksinski, however, could not supply all the monetary details; and \nwe still do not know how much money arrived in the Bolshevik \nexchequer. Finances were in any case not the greatest difficulty for \nRussian parties in the months from March 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee obtained its \npremises in the Kshesinskaya Palace, but paid nothing for it and \nejected the owner, the ex-ballerina and court favourite M. Also, the 200-300,000 people who \njoined the Bolshevik party were expected to contribute to party \nfunds, 78 and Pravda, after its first issue, was not given away but sold. \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions. 79 In the following discussions with \nCentral Committee emissaries, Lenin insisted on returning to put his \ncase.80 Lenin \narrived bewigged and beardless. 82 Then Lenin spoke for an hour.83 The gist of Lenin's words, however, has survived. Again, he \ncontrasted mid-October with early July, arguing that 'the majority' \nwas behind the Bolsheviks.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'. 87 \nBefore such an audience, which was in closer touch than he with \ncurrent political developments, Lenin sought to argue that insurrec-\ntion was urgently required. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. Uritski, while being on the left of the Bolshevik \n To All the Peoples \n253 \nspectrum, asserted that the military force available for an insurrec-\ntion was insubstantial; but he took this as a reason for conducting \nstrenuous propaganda among the Petro grad garrison soldiers. After the Central Committee meeting they were to \ncompose a letter to various leading Bolshevik bodies; and its contents \npresumably give an indication of the arguments used by them at the \nmeeting itself. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two.93 None the less, Lenin had \nnot got quite everything his way: the suggestion that the transfer of \npower should take place at the northern regional soviet gathering was \nr~jected. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide. His \ncolleagues also felt that, even if an uprising in Minsk were to succeed \n(which was unlikely), a damaging impression would be given that \npower was passing not to the soviets in general but to a splinter \ngroup of soviets dominated by Bolsheviks.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. It also \nremained to be discovered how the rest of the Bolshevik party would \ntake to the Central Committee's line. Kamenev and Zinoviev \ndispatched their critical letter to the Petersburg and Moscow City \nCommittees as well as to other influential party bodies and fractions \ninside the soviets;96 they knew that other right-wing members of the \nCentral Committee - notably Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov - had not \nattended on 10 October: the hope was nurtured that a further debate \nmight pull Lenin back from the brink. Nor do all the major city \ncommittees of the Bolshevik party seem to have been initiated into \nthe decision of 10 October. This possibly suited Lenin, since he knew \nhe had a strong chance of support from the Petrograd and Moscow \nleaderships. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. 10\u00b0 Casually snatching off his wig and \nplacing it on the table in front of him, Lenin repeated the arguments \nin favour of speedy insurrection. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. Volodarski from the Petrograd Soviet maintained that \nworkers would answer a summons from the Soviet \u00b7to take to the \nstreets. Every other \nspeaker, including the Bolshevik rightist V. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. It also displayed a \nfeeling throughout Russian politics that Kerenski's government had \nlost its way; that Kerenski would not go quietly and would try to \ndisarm the soviets; that the Bolsheviks should not flinch in the \ncoming trial of strength. And so discussion shifted towards the \nquestion whether the Bolsheviks should initiate the clash. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Lenin \ncastigated both of them for ignoring 'objective conditions'. Lenin's sharp words did not \nhave an immediate effect. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. 112 \nIt was beginning to look as if the meeting regarded defence as the \nbest form of attack; and Zinoviev and Kamenev, sensing that their \nposition was not in fact irretrievable, restated their objection to \nLenin. His solution was to suggest that the \nforthcoming All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies be kept in permanent session until the Consti-\ntuent Assembly so as to pressurise the Assembly to carry out the \nappropriate decisions. Kamenev charged Lenin with forcing the \npolitical pace. '1,' he declared, 'have a greater faith in the Russian \nrevolution. Lenin had for \nmonths declared that only the Bolsheviks would dare to convoke the \nAssembly. Lenin's motion reaffirmed the 10 October decision and \n To All the Peoples \n257 \nexpressed 'complete confidence that the Central Committee and the \nSoviet would at the right time indicate the propitious moment and the \nappropriate methods of the offensive'. Uritski and Dzierzynski; all were instructed to \n'enter the membership of the revolutionary Soviet committee' .120 It is \nlikely that the reference was to the Military-Revolutionary Commit-\ntee of the Petrograd Soviet, and that this was its preferred instrument \nfor the government's overthrow. \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. When this Committee was selected on 20 \nOctober, its five-man Bureau included three Bolsheviks: Antonov-\nOvseenko, Podvoiski and Sadovski. \nLenin approved the Central Committee's choi \u00b7e of the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee as the organ of insurredion and wished to \nkeep its activities under review. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. Sverdlov main-\ntained contact with Podvoiski, whom he sent to Lenin - probably on \nsome date between 20 and 23 October. 122 Lenin conducted a \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngruelling interview since Podvoiski wanted the Bolshevik Military \nOrganisation to head the uprising. Lenin supported the Central \nCommittee in insisting that a non-party organ, the Petrograd \nSoviet's Military-Revolutionary Committee, should have charge. For the purposes of political presenta-\ntion it was vital that 'the Soviet' and not 'the party' was seen to be \nseizing power. 124 \nLenin was merely accentuating their point (and at last displaying the \ntactical subtlety which was to win him such renown); but his \nintervention put a useful check on Podvoiski. 125 He wanted no \nrepetition of the trouble caused by the Bureau of the Bolshevik \nMilitary Organisation in the July Days. Podvoiski got his own back \nby enquiring about Lenin's progress with 'the decrees on the land, on \npeace, on workers' control over production and on the organisation \nof the Soviet republic'. But Lenin laughed off Podvoiski's implied \nreproach: 'First it's necessary to seize power and then set about \nprinting the decrees. Kamenev and Zinoviev had dispatched an anti-Lenin letter to \nBolshevik party organisations; and, on 18 October, Kamenev \npublished a declaration against a seizure of power in the far-left \nsocialist but non-Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn (or 'New \nLife'). J3J Trotski had taken to suggesting that, if the \nBolsheviks took tg the streets, it would happen only in reaction to an \nattack by the Provisional Government; 132 and Zinoviev was attracted \nto such a proposition even though he knew that Trotski was using it \nmerely as a subterfuge. Stalin, Workers' Path editor, probably calculated also that \nZinoviev and Kamenev would help in restraining Lenin from too \nreckless a strategy in the days ahead. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Lenin's incaution had \nacquired deserved notoriety in August and September; his harangues \nin favour of action at any price could have cost the party dearly in \nOctober. The Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee continued preparations for an uprising \nwhenever the moment seemed ripe. The Bolshevik press in \nPetrograd warned constantly of the dangers posed by a resuscitation \nof Kornilovite conspiracies. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. On 22 October, Trotski broke cover by advocating \nthat the forthcoming Congress of Soviets should select a new \ngovernment for the country. He asked a \nPetrograd Soviet crowd to pledge support to him and his endeavours. There remained several Bolsheviks, not only in the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee but also in the\u00b7 party's City Committee, \nwho demanded an immediate seizure of power: Lenin was not the \nonly Leninist. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 136 Fofanova, who \nworked in the Bolshevik Central Committee Secretariat, implored \nhim not to venture out of doors. On 24 October, Kerenski tried to \nsuppress Bolshevik newspapers in the capital; police raids were \nfrequent. To the Central \nCommittee's delight, Kerenski's repressive demarche was widely \ntaken to authenticate the Bolshevik claim that they were simply \ndefending themselves when making their military dispositions. \nAnd yet the proffered help of one central figure, Lenin, was \nshrugged aside. Lenin sent out Fofanova several times to the Central \nCommittee in the Smolny Institute on 24 October with his pleas to be \nallowed out of hiding. \nHe covered part of his face with a bandage, positioned his trusty wig \non his head, grabbed his cap and went with Eino Rahja towards \nBolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. As the Bolsheviks and \ntheir supporters in the armed forces and the Red Guard spread their \npower through the capital, a surprised and dejected Kerenski made \nhis plans for escape from the cordon around the Winter Palace. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. 147 Lenin's tactical recommendations were therefore little \ndistinguishable from the Central Committee's current practice. Lenin \nsought to change this. It was Lenin's will to ensure that, when the delegatt:s \nassembled, power would already have been grasped from the \nProvisional Government; and, as soon as he reached the Institute, \nhe imparted this idea to his colleagues with characteristic insistence. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. Its contents are \nunknown; 152 but Lenin took over the final elaboration. At 10 am Lenin decided that the \nmoment was appropriate to announce the regime's removal. \nComposing a manifesto 'to the citizens of Russia', he declared: \n'The Provisional Government has been overthrown. State power had \npassed into the hands of tht\" organ of the Petrograd Soviet of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies: the Military-Revolutionary So-\nviet, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \ngarrison'. Lenin \npresumably wanted to have it recorded that the insurrection had been \nundertaken before the Congress met. This interim, on the other hand, \nprevented any possible vacillation by the non-Bolshevik \u00b7delegates to \nthe Congress about Kerenski's overthrow; they would meet with a \nfait accompli. \nLenin's case for urgent measures was not entirely a figment of his \nfevered brain. The Bolsheviks, while knowing that they would \nconstitute by far the largest party at the Congress with around 300 \nout of 670 delegates, knew they would lack a clear majority. Lenin redoubled his demands for a storming of the \npalace, but the besieger. A Petrograd \nSoviet session opened at 2. \nHis statement that Lenin was to address the Petrograd Soviet drew \n\\mremitting applause'. Trotski gave him a suitable introduction: \n'Long live comrade Lenin, who has now returned to us.' 158 Lenin, \nhardly identifiable without his moustache, spoke briefly on the \nprogramme of the as yet unformed Soviet government. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. An \nunnamed member of the audience interjected that the Bolshevik \nparty had improperly arrogated the rights of the Congress of Soviets. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. 161 \nNeither then nor later did Lenin indicate whether his tactics had \nbeen deliberately geared towards this very result. \nMartov, himself no great tactician, could scarcely believe that Dan \nand Chernov, who twenty four hours previously had endorsed \npolicies designed to bring about an immediate peace and an \nimmediate confiscation of gentry-owned land, would walk out of a \nCongress which was about to announce exactly such policies, and \nthat they would toss aside the opportunity to bargain with the \nBolsheviks about the composition of an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform.165 Martov rose, on the Congress floor, to call for a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict on Petrograd's streets, and for negotiations \nto produce a government consisting of all the parties represented in \nthe soviets. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Lunacharski, a member of the Novaya Zhizn group, who \nhad rejoined the Bolsheviks with the Interdistricters, declared that he \nhad 'absolutely no objection' to Martov's suggestion. The main-\nstream leaderships of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies, however, held to their plan; they castigated the Bolshevik-led \nviolence, demanded further negotiations with Kerenski and walked \nout. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. 169 \nEarlier in the year, there had been vituperative claims that Lenin \nhad returned to Russia to claim the long-vacant throne of the \nanarchist Bakunin. Such claims misread Lenin's intentions; for the \nstateless communities of anarchism were no part of the Bolshevik \nleader's intentions for the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the \npoorest peasants'. The \nBolshevik fraction of the Congress of Soviets met to co-ordinate \ntactics. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. Lenin was busy in all of them: he \nhad returned to the centre of action. Decrees and resolutions on the \ngovernment, on the land and on peace were hastily negotiated - and \nLenin, having sent his sister Mariya back to Fofanova's flat for \nmaterial, undertook most of the composition. Trotski \nand Lenin, joint architects of the October Revolution, shared the \nstage; and Lenin, to tumultuous applause, introduced the proceed-\nings and laid the 'Decree on Peace' and the 'Decree on Land' before \nthe Congress. 173 \nFIRST WEEK, FIRST DECREES \nThe various pronouncements made by the Bolshevik leadership in the \nweek after the October seizure in Petrograd were of momentous \nsignificance in modern Russian history; and they also deserve \n To All the Peoples \n267 \nscrutiny inasmuch as their wording reveals much about the worries \nwhich the Bolshevik party leadership had about the political \nsituation. Lenin had previously been arguing that the party's \nsupporters would appreciate action better than words. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. \nThe proclamation written by him for the Congress of Soviets on 25 \nOctober174 had justified the 'victorious uprising' in Petrograd by \nreference to the 'will of the huge majority of workers, soldiers and \npeasants'. These were early days, and the Bolsheviks and their \nsupporters watched warily how the countryside would react to them. \nThe proclamation described the intentions of 'soviet power'. 'Soviet power' would also guarantee the right of self-\ndetermination for 'all nations inhabiting Russia' . The forcible \n 268 \nLenin: A Political L(fe \nincorporation of 'small nationalities' was explicitly rejected. 180 The \nSoviet authorities declared a wish to abandon secret diplomacy \nforever. Yet \nLenin was not quite as incautious and lacking in guile as might \nappear. The \nreasons were not explained by Lenin. The claim has sometimes been \nmade that he was already backing away from his earlier commitment \nto international revolution, or at least that he was placing the \ninterests of the Soviet state's survival above those of potential \nrevolutions elsewhere. Lenin \nconsequently employed uncharacteristic vocabulary, describing the \ncontinuation of the War as 'the greatest crime against humanity'. 187 \nThis was as near as Lenin could go towards a call for international \nsocialist revolution without aggravating the already great risk that \nhis decree would not be published outside Russia. Furthermore, Lenin \n~sserted that the land of 'rank-and-file peasants' was not subject to \nconfiscation. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. The principal \nmeasure signalling the other side of Bolshevik intentions was the \nDecree on the Press which was published on 27 October. The Decree \non the Press made plain that the Soviet authorities under the \nBolsheviks would brook no fundamental opposition (and the \ncontemporaneous searches of houses and printing enterprises by \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee enforced the decree immedia-\ntely). Bolshevik spokesmen argued, as had Lenin in The State and \nRevolution that the propertied classes had always had an unfair \nadvantage in setting up newspapers, and that the use of the press \nshould not be confined mainly to the rich. Yet the basic intention to \nclose down anti-Bolshevik newspapers was only lightly veiled. \nThemes of repression figured less in the output of decrees and \ninstructions than themes of liberation; but this did not signify that \nLenin came to government with gentle aims. Laws to nationalise banks and \nindustrial syndicates, which Lenin had talked of before the October \nseizure of power, had yet to be formulated. Eventually, on 5 \nNovember, twelve days after the Petrograd uprising, Lenin released a \nstatement calling on workers to 'introduce the strictest control over \nproduction and accounts' and to arrest anyone found committing \nsabotage. Instead, the new authorities laid their stress on the rupture \nwith the politics of Russia and Europe constituted by the October \nseizure of power. Workers, along \nwith soldiers and peasants, were being encouraged to 'take all power \nin the localities into the hands of their soviets'. It has been tempting \nto treat the Russian revolutionary events as if they were entirely \nindependent of the situation in the rest of the world and as if Russia, \nwhile having an impact on other countries, did not in her turn \nregister their impact. The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. As night \nfollows day, it was certain that Russian withdrawal from the conflict \nwould attract unpleasant consequences from abroad. If revolutions failed \nto occur in Europe, the chances of Sovnarkom's survival were \nintimately linked to the question of whether any foreign capitalist \npower had the resources and opportunity to intervene militarily in \nRussia. No Russian army in 1917-18 could have repelled the armed \nmight of either the Germans or the Allies if such might had been \nturned on them in concerted fashion. \nThus the absence of revolutionary explosions in Europe, as Lenin \nwas to concede, 1 meant that his regime's fortunes depended \nultimately on a factor beyond its control: the continued mutual \nexhaustion of the Central Powers and the Allies in the War. \nThe victorious progress of Bolshevism before October 1917 could \nnot permanently obscure these supreme military issues. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nLenin's name had been on several successful lists put forward by \nthe Bolsheviks; and, in accordance with the then current system of \nproportional representation, he chose to be returned as one of the \ndeputies for the Baltic fleet. His manipulativeness and \nlack of public candour was so extreme that, while the Second \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was in \nsession, he implored his Bolshevik Central Committee colleagues to \nannounce a postponement of the Constituent Assembly elections.4 \nThis was a natural corollary of his admission to the Central \nCommittee on 10 October that the Constituent Assembly would \nnot side with the Bolsheviks. Only 168, or 22 per cent, were Bolsheviks; they had suffered a \nmassive defeat. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary.8 And yet no Bolshevik before October is recorded as \nhaving anticipated the scale of the actual defeat. Lenin's worst fears \nduring the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies were fulfilled. \nBolshevik spokesmen argued that the Assembly arrangements had \nbeen unfair to them. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. Lenin recognised that \ncaution had to be exercised with regard to his own party members \n(who were not universally in favour of the Assembly's suppression), \nto some among his Left Socialist Revolutionary allies and to a \ngeneral population which might not take kindly to the infringement \nof its newly-obtained democratic rights. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. On 12 \nDecember, Lenin successfully called for the reselection of the Bureau \nof the Bolshevik fraction in the Assembly on the grounds that a \nsterner attitude towards the Assembly was appropriate: nothing was \nbeing left to chance. He also met with Bolshevik leaders who had \nreturned from the Ukraine; 14 he spoke on the phone with the \nAmerican Ambassador in Petrograd. 18 Yet Lenin refused \nto be deflected from his tasks. On 3 \nJanuary 1918 the announcement was made on Sovnarkom's behalf \nthat the Constituent Assembly would be acceptable only if it \nsupported 'soviet power'. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. 22 A demonstration held by supporters \nof the Assembly, who naively supposed that the Bolsheviks would \nnot use force upon fellow socialists, was fired upon. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out.24 (It was also a very rare \nexample of Lenin using quasi-humorous behaviour to achieve a \npolitical end. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. The Socialist Revolu-\ntionary agenda was accepted by a vote on the floor, and the \nBolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries walked out in \nprotest. By late evening he was \nreading out the details of legislation that he now perceived the \nBolsheviks would stop him implementing.25 \nMeanwhile Lenin, conferring with the Bolshevik fraction, decided \nthat there should be no second session of the Assembly.26 Orders \nwere issued forbidding the Palace guard to attack the opponents of \nSovnarkom as they left the building; earlier in the day a Bolshevik \nsupporter had pointed his rifle at the unfortunate Shvetsov as he was \nspeaking.27 A forlorn group of anti-Bolshevik Constituent \nAssembly delegates left the Palace, never to return. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. Lenin could at last relax. Bonch-Bruevich later \nrecalled: 'Lenin was agitated and was paler than ever before . Perhaps he was getting his own back for the \nderision he had suffered at their hands when, at the First Congress of \nSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in June 1917, he had \nexclaimed that his party was willing to rule Russia alone. Lenin's self-\nrestraint could not disguise the momentousness of the occasion. With \nor without Lenin's actions, there would probably have been civil war \nin Russia after the Provisional Government's demise. But the \ndestruction of the Constituent Assembly, which was ratified by a \ndecree of Sovnarkom on 6 January, ensured that the anti-Bolshevik \narmies would be stronger than they might otherwise have been. \nMany Socialist Revolutionaries were to fight against the Reds, not \nbecause they shared the aims of generals from the old imperial \nregiments but in pursuit of rectifying the great wrong done to their \nparty at the Tauride Palace. The Bolsheviks had talked increasingly \nabout civil war since coming to power, but they claimed that it was \nthe Kadets and their allies who were bent on unleashing military \nconflict. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. It burned bright in the minds of Constituent \nAssembly deputies who had come to Petrograd demanding fair \npolitical treatment and the chance to bring Bolshevik rule peacefully \nto an end. Their current aim was to establish a government of Assembly \ndeputies in the Volga region and to seek the military removal of the \nBolsheviks from power throughout Russia. \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSOVNARKOM'S CHAIRMAN \nYet Lenin had an arsenal of self-confidence. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition.32 The Bolsheviks \nwould predictably dominate it since they held even more town and \ncity soviets than in October 1917. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. The tactical beauty of this, from the Bolshevik \nparty's standpoint, was that the overwhelming majority of the \ncountry's population were peasants and that Sovnarkom would \ntherefore come to appear as representative of the lower social classes \nin general and not just the workers and the urban poor. Bolshevik hegemony would be preserved. The Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were as naive about the Bolshevik central leader-\nship's ruthlessness as the Socialist Revolutionaries had been about \nLenin's disregard for the rights of the Constituent Assembly; but at \n The Obscene Peace \n311 \nthe time they thought the deal worth making since the Bolsheviks \nwere willing to offer them compromises on the single act of \nlegislation, then under preparation, that most interested them: the \nBasic Land Law. 33 \nNot that Lenin's planning lacked an idealistic aspect. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty. 36 Lenin had imbibed enough \nof the revolutionary spirit to allow fellow People's Commissars to \nraise subjects not previously tabled for discussion,37 but his instinct \nwas to reinforce order and orderliness. 39 \nIn the intervals between Bolshevik Central Committee meetings,40 \nSovnarkom was the major centre of power in the country. Lenin tried \nto direct its entire work. Trotski and Stalin were invaluable collaborators, and \nthe skills of the Bolshevik ex-undergrounders at central and local \nlevels of government ought not to be forgotten. Trotski's past as an anti-Bolshevik and his obvious \ntalent (and, worse still, his knowledge of his talent) counted against \nhim. Of the other prominent Bolsheviks, both \nZinoviev and Kamenev had compromised themselves by their so-\ncalled 'strike-breaking' in October 1917; and younger leaders such as \nBukharin and Pyatakov, who were taken seriously by Lenin before \n1917 and who were to figure in his 'testament' of 1922, lacked \nLenin's prestige and authority. When all is said and done, however, none \nof these practical administrators rivalled Lenin. 43 \nNot that Lenin lived a life that was normal for most inhabitants of \nthe Soviet republic.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries were nervous about peasant feelings \nand on 6 December the new tax law was amended to allow local \nsoviets to exempt the poorer sections of the population from all \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntaxation. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation.49 \nThis title signified that nationalisation was no longer a Bolshevik \nshort-term aim. The Bolsheviks had \nwanted to base transfers of property to a greater extent with an \nincrease of productivity in mind; but the need to reconcile their \npartners in Sovnarkom forced them to give way. This meant that Bolshevism also had to forgo an \ninsistence on retention of the large estates in integral form; and that \nthe agricultural wage labourers, as distinct from poor peasants, were \nnot supported as strongly as the Bolsheviks had originally desired. 52 \nLenin won a few minor battles. 54 The return to \ntheir native villages of hundreds of thousands of peasant conscripts, \nwhose acquaintance with the Bolshevik programme was closer than \nthat of the normal rural population, made little difference. Local \nsoviets from January 1918 started to dispatch armed squads into the \ncountryside in quest of grain. 55 Sovnarkom desisted from com pre-\n The Obscene Peace \n315 \nhensive forcible requisitioning, and Lenin's occasional talk of an anti-\nspeculator terror was not yet a systematic and lasting policy. 56 \nThe Bolshevik inclination towards using violence against the \npeasantry, which is traceable to the manipulative attitude to \npeasants traditional in Bolshevik thought,57 was emerging, but the \narmy which would be necessary to suppress peasant discontent, was \nnot yet formed. Sovnarkom encouraged demobilisation of several \nregiments in late 1917. The pre-October commitment to demilitaris-\ning industrial production and switching to output for the civilian \nmarket was also being fulfilled; and Sverdlov engineered the closure \nof Bolshevik party committees in the Russian army on the Eastern \nfront. 58 Yet military conflict, in civil war and in foreign anti-\nBolshevik crusades, was expected. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.60 Six weeks later, on 21 January 1918, the Soviet authorities \nunilaterally annulled the foreign and domestic loans incurred by \nNikolai II and the Provisional Government.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists. \nThirty-eight per cent of large factories were closed in the first ten \nmonths of Soviet power.63 A state-managed industrial sector seemed \nto most Bolshevik leaders the cure for this problem. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists. But Bukharin and Osinski pressed for the creation of a \ngeneral body to co-ordinate the process and obtained Lenin's \nconsent.66 \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Council's ameliorative impact on the industry and trade was \nnegligible. Even Lenin was \naccepting the sober predictions of his associate, V. Milyutin, \nbefore October 1917.68 There were still Bolsheviks who drew up \nplans for a perfectly-functioning system of complete economic \nmanagement, as Lenin irritably noted. \n'Workers' control' was not abandoned as a policy; a statute on the \nprinciple was passed on 14 November 1917. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. Few Bolsheviks objected when Aleksandr Shlyapnikov was \nappointed commissar with extra-legal powers to restore an opera-\ntional network. \nThis menacing condescension had been largely, but not wholly, \nsubmerged in Bolshevik pronouncements before October 1917. The Bolshevik leaders did not \nenjoy the compulsion they were applying to the working class; they \nassumed that, in time, the workers would understand the require-\nments of the situation and would support the party. 73 Lenin's old adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nstrongly disapproved of what he regarded a a premature attempt at \nthe transition to socialism; and the dispersal of the Constituent \nAssembly appalled him.74 And skilled \nand literate workers assumed positions in the administration of the \nyoung Soviet state. \nTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN DISPUTE \nLenin's restlessness with Trotski's tactic of 'neither war nor peace' \ngrew sharply in 1918. On 7 January, a day after the Constituent \nAssembly's closure and six days after the assassination attempt, the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders conferred while Trotski briefly took leave from \nBrest-Litovsk. The terms offered to the Soviet delegation by \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, especially the proposal that the \narmies of the Central Powers would maintain their occupation in \nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic region, had provoked a furious \nreaction in the local committees of the Bolshevik party.77 \nOn 8 January, Lenin could ascertain the strength of the internal \nparty opposition when he addressed sixty three leaders of the \nBolshevik fraction to the Third Congress of Soviets of Workers', \nSoldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. 80 \nA wedge existed between two tendencies of opinion hostile to a \nseparate peace; and Trotski had confided that, in the event of a \nGerman invasion, Lenin could count on his vote in favour of a \nseparate peace. 'In any event,' \nLenin argued with Trotski, 'I stand for the immediate signature of \npeace, it is more secure. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee. But it would give time for the \nBolsheviks to 'strangle' the Russian bourgeoisie and to prepare an \narmy for a future revolutionary war- he made no pretence of being a \npacifist. But he had always recognised the practical \ndifficulties and wanted, for the moment, to allow Trotski's policy \nof prolonging the negotiations to continue;85 and Moisei Uritski, \nwho had worked shoulder to shoulder with Lenin over the \nConstituent Assembly, maintained that Lenin was now guilty of \nthe same Russo-centrism in foreign policy that had played him false \nin 1915.86 Lenin was obviously not the only Bolshevik leader who \ncould point to another Bolshevik leader's past failings. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened. Yet signs appeared that Lenin was gaining ground: five \nparticipants now voted in favour of a separate peace.95 Their anti-Lenin \narguments were not as unequivocal as they might have been.96 \nAt Brest-Litovsk, time was running out for the Soviet delegation. Lenin urged \na rapid reconvening of the peace talks and, if the Germans were still \nwilling, the signature of a treaty on the terms specified in December \n1917. No one, to Lenin's relief, would any longer press the case \nfor an immediate declaration of revolutionary war. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). 98 Lenin had come within inches of political victory in \nthe Central Committee. Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. 102 Trotski was now \non Lenin's side. Nerves of steel would still be required; nobody in the \nBolshevik Central Committee knew whether the Central Powers, \nonce their armies had started moving and found the resistance to be \nso feeble, would agree to halt. The \nrespective policies of Lenin and Trotski, mutually contradictory, had \nto be reassessed. \nThe republic would be confined to central, northern and south-\neastern Russia and the territory to the east. \nLenin, while suspecting him of posturing, declined to respond. 105 Lenin was horrified and threatened to \nleave Sovnarkom and the Central Committee: 'These terms must be \nsigned.' 106 Lomov struck back: 'It is \n 322 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnecessary to take power without V. [Lenin].'107 \nBut Lenin could see he would win. 109 Yet Lenin's victory was \ncomplete in the Central Committee. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means. Soviets, trade unions, factory-workshop commit-\ntees, and party organs: these were infused with Bolshevik personnel \nwho were instructed to get on with the job at hand.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. Naturally this \npushed leading Bolsheviks back into the central body where they \ncould resolve their own disagreements on policy definitively and \nwithout interference from other parties. The \nargument over coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries in November 1917 had involved a similar recourse to the \nCentral Committee; but the three months of controversy over the \nproposed separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmore intense and set a powerful precedent for subsequent develop-\nmentsY1 \n The Obscene Peace \n323 \nThe party as a whole resumed greater importance when the Brest-\nLitovsk negotiations were discussed. While the battle raged in the \nCentral Committee, Bolsheviks at lower levels was riven by conflict. \nLenin recognised that the central party leadership's authority was not \nlimitless and that further struggles would be necessary if the party \nwas to follow the newly-adopted central policy. Lenin had not written such a message \nto Plekhanov in the dispute of 1900. Only Trotski \ncame near to him in prestige as a pre-eminent Soviet statesman; but \neven Trotski could have no claim to recognition as the Bolshevik \nparty chief. There was talk among them of dropping \nLenin from the government and even of imprisoning him if this alone \nwould guarantee the retention of a policy hostile to a separate peace. 114 \nLenin, by contrast, was someone who could confront a difficult \nsituation and take responsibility for the outcome. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. But his international policy of 1918 came \nout well in comparison with the suggestions of his Left Communist \nopponents. \nLenin also had the advantage of possessing a strong group in the \ncentral party apparatus. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. These two shaped the contents of the Secretariat's correspon-\ndence in the direction of acceptance of Lenin's policy. 118 His proven skills as a polemicist made Lenin, who had \nalways had a soft spot for 'Grisha', forgive everything that had \nhappened between them in October 1917. Lenin cannot have been \nwholly displeased when Zinoviev unleashed a furious assault on \nTrotski's vacillatory demeanour in the Brest-Litovsk dispute even \nafter Trotski had disowned the proposal for revolutionary war: it was \nimportant that Trotski was warned not to change his mind yet \nagain. 123 \nMany Bolshevik opponents experienced inhibitions in attacking him. Safarov denied that Lenin's faction were \ndescribable as 'collaborators' with imperialism. Their policies embodied \nideological purity and practical despair. 127 In addi-\ntion, there could be no revolutionary war if only the local Bolshevik \ncommittee members were in favour of fighting it. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. 129 \nIt is against this background that the swing towards Lenin has to \nbe assessed. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. Their commitment to intra-\nparty democracy was no firmer than Lenin's. So Lenin's instinctive \nfeeling was realistic that his policy had a great chance of acceptance \nif open discussions were held and if those party rank-and-filers who \nwere likely candidates for conscription in a revolutionary war were \nmade aware of the implications. Without Lenin, the Brest-Litovsk \ntreaty would probably not have been signed; and the Germans might \nwell have invaded all Russia. But Lenin had a tide of mass opinion \nrunning his way, and no Russian politician knew better how to \nexploit his advantages. 133 \nThe second (and penultimate) day started with Lenin's political \nreport. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 134 Success, according to \nLenin, had been possible only because 'international imperialism' \nwas temporarily distracted from intervening in Russia. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany.' 136 Safety for the Soviet republic would come about only \nthrough 'an all-European revolution'. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. Just as Lenin's Bolshevik followers had \nswallowed their pride by participating in Stolypin's emasculated \nThird State Duma in 1907, so now they ought to conclude a \nseparate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bolshevik leftists were like the Polish noblemen of \nformer times who died in a beautiful pose, saying: 'Peace is a \ndisgrace, war is honour. Lenin was lucky to face such opponents. \nLenin was gambling on obtaining a lengthy breathing space, on the \nGermans abiding by their word, on the inability of the two military \ncoalitions in the War to come together to strangle the young Soviet \nrepublic in its cradle. So \n 328 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhy bend the knee to the German high command at Brest-Litovsk. Uritski noted sarcastically that \nLenin would sign a separate peace even if it was destined to last only \na couple of days. 144 Like other Bolshevik leftists, Uritski was \nhorrified both by the compulsory evacuation of the recently-\nconquered Ukraine and by the compulsory demobilisation of the \nRussian army.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. This was a polemical opportunity \nthat would not have been missed by Lenin if the roles had been \nreversed. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. 153 \nTrotski also helped Lenin by declaring contempt for the leftist plan \nfor partisan warfare conducted with 'the knives of Pskov peasants' \ninstead of rifles and artillery. Ryazanov was less charitable \nto Lenin's group, accusing Sverdlov of closing down the party's \norganisations in the old army solely in order to make it harder for the \nparty to resist the proposal for a separate peace. Stozhok from the Donbass opposed Lenin's policy; \n0. Maskov, a Urals \ndelegate, came over to Lenin's side despite having been mandated \nto advocate revolutionary war. 160 Debate was ended, and \nBukharin's closing speech predicted that the 'breathing space' would \nnot be realised and that Lenin would soon have to adopt the position \nof the Bolshevik left. 161 Lenin replied that, if it had not been for \nBukharin, the Central Committee would have chosen its current \nsensible policy earlier. Abrasively, he added: 'To declare war on \nGermany now would mean giving in to the provocation of the \nRussian bourgeoisie. And where Lenin had spoken generally about \na breathing-space before 'the attack of the imperialists', Trotski \nwanted to mention 'the inevitable and imminent attack'. The motion called for 'the most energetic, \nmercilessly decisive and draconian measures to raise the self-\ndiscipline and discipline of the workers and peasants of Russia'; it \ndeclared that 'a liberationist, patriotic socialist war' was unavoidable, \nand that universal military training should be put in hand. 168 The \nCongress therefore decided to pass Lenin's resolution but to withhold \nit from publication. Instead a short announcement on the ratification \nof the peace would appear in the official Soviet press. Lenin held himself aloof from the wrangling. The \nepisode gave further reinforcement to Lenin's position as patriarch of \nhis party. Lenin \ngave a joint report on two further issues: the revision of the party \nprogramme and the change of the party's name. His aim was to \nincorporate sections in the programme to highlight the differences \nbetween the Bolsheviks and most other adherents of the Second \nInternational. Lenin, denouncing 'bourgeois democratism', called for a \nnew type of democracy based on the Russian soviets. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. While 'subscribing to Lenin's every word in his characterisa-\ntion of the state', he called for a definition of socialism. Lenin's \nvague references to the nationalisation of the means of production \nlacked the necessary concreteness. 178 When debate shifted to the \nquestion of the party's name, however, Bukharin spoke strongly on \nLenin's side; and the Congress voted to redesignate the party as the \n 332 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in order to distinguish it \nfrom other Marxist parties in Russia and elsewhere. Trotski's success signalled his meteoric rise in the \nBolshevik party. 184 \nLenin, despite his brave face, knew that troubles remained in store \nfor the Soviet republic. \nConflicts between the peasantry and the local soviets were intensi-\nfied. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. \nAnd in south-eastern Russia, the Socialist Revolutionaries were \nmustering to establish an alternative Russian government consisting \n The Obscene Peace \n333 \nof deputies from the dispersed Constituent Assembly. Anti-Bolshevik \nregimes had sprung up in the Transcaucasus and counter-revolu-\ntionary armies were being formed in south Russia and Siberia to \noverthrow Sovnarkom. International problems were acute: Germany \ncould not be trusted even after the Brest-Litovsk treaty, and the \nAllies, furthermore, were already planning armed intervention in \nRussia. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. He sought \ninfluence among Marxists. He did not control the Bolshevik faction \nand, in the First World War, his contacts with its members in the \nRussian empire became extremely frail and intermittent. \nNevertheless, at the level of political philosophy, he markedly \ninfluenced his own Bolsheviks even though they objected to his \ndivisive tirades; and, as often as not, it was Lenin who set the agenda \nfor Bolshevik debates even if he did not always win them. He had \nthe inestimable advantage that the maintenance of a foreign-based \napparatus was important for Bolsheviks in the Russian empire. Thus \nthe Okhrana, by arresting revolutionaries and severely constricting \nthe freedoms of the illegal labour movement, made a Lenin possible. \nAnd so he survived, acquiring the prestige of a veteran and a major \nthinker among Bolsheviks. His \nMarxism evinced a fanaticism which was common in varying degrees \namong Bolsheviks - and it was alloyed with non-Marxist doctrines \nand impulses which he did not acknowledge. Bolshevism was not the \n 334 \nLenin: A Political Life \noriginator of all ideas of dictatorship. The idea that the oppressive \ntsarist order should be followed immediately by an order which \nforeswore authoritarianism had a long tradition in Russian revolu-\ntionary attitudes before the Bolsheviks existed; and it was not \nconfined to the Russian empire either. Lenin's framework of Marx-\nism was very elastic. On many questions of Russian politics and \neconomics, furthermore, he developed ideas which were combatively \nexpressed. When he insisted that the Bolsheviks should address the \nnational question, he took risks with his own reputation among \nthem. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. Yet this was an \nexaggerated image; Russian military defeat and economic collapse \nwere not caused by him and his party, and the Provisional \nGovernment was falling headlong before its dissolution. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. Yet the socio-economic requirements of urban \nRussia clashed with what was demanded by the countryside. \nLenin's policies misjudged the enormity of the old Russian em-\npire's crisis. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. The chances of the prolonged survival of such a regime, \nlinking Bolsheviks with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, \nhad never been large; but Lenin was prominent in preventing the \nattempt from being made. He brushed aside all criticism with the \ndeclaration that the policies of the Mensheviks and the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had had their opportunity in government before the \nOctober Revolution, and they had failed. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world.", "Bolshevik_Policy_1920": " \nLENIN AND TROTSKJ \nBolsheviks wanted the Soviet state to guide all public and private \ninstitutions in their expanding republic. \nThe Bolshevik party had expounded such an ambition soon after the \nOctober Revolution, and elaborated it in its party programme at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919. Even among Bolsheviks there \nwere inhibitions about the desirable scope of the state's pretensions. \nThe October Revolution was meant, in Lenin's words, to introduce a \ndictatorship of the proletariat. The fact that the party had used \nviolence against the working class had not eradicated a feeling among \nBolsheviks that the interests of the workers should be protected. Leading Bolshevik \ntrade unionists, such as Central Committee member Mikhail Tomski, \nwere comfortable with the notion of a one-party and one-ideology \nstate. Trotski, People's \nCommissar of Military Affairs, requested the militarisation of Soviet \npublic life. Trotski's continuation of his challenge to party policy \ndistracted attention from Stalin's humiliation and re-focussed attention \non Trotski. Lenin despaired of his Politburo and Red Army colleague. There \nhad been assaults on Lenin's management of both the Polish campaign \nand the party's internal affairs, and a resolution had been passed on the \nneed to reform party organisation. The \npeasants of Russia and the Ukraine were taking up arms against the \nSoviet authorities. In Lenin's estimation, these were the issues requiring urgent \nattention. For a start, Trotski was resting his case on practicality as well \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas theory. \nIn Trotski's opinion, the working class of 1917 no longer existed.3 \nLenin, however, had luck inasmuch as his policy neither necessitated \nan unsettling change in the measures of the day nor confronted \nparticularly fearsome adversaries; for the Democratic Centralists and \nWorkers' Opposition did not much trouble him. Lenin, as he had shown in controversy after controversy before the \nGreat War and would show again in the foreign-trade discussion of \n1922, was even more likely to act in such a fashion. Lenin would tolerate him no \nmore. These were \non the 'left' of the Bolshevik political spectrum: Bukharin, Dzierzynski, \nKrestinski, Radek and Serebryakov. Lenin was forced to back off. 16 \nThe commission's composition was balanced equally between Lenin \nand Trotski. 19 Like all the \nBolshevik leaders, he had a genuine ideological commitment. \n 156 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski refused to participate in the charade. \nThis time he was more aggressive than Lenin.22 But the stand-off between Lenin and \nTrotski meant that his reduced group held the balance of power in the \nCentral Committee; and, although not all of the group's members liked \nhis specific slogan, it was sufficiently vague to allow them to force it \nthrough as Central Committee policy. Lenin was as \nannoyed with Bukharin in 1920 as with Trotski two years previously. Even \nif allowance is made for the fact that the Soviet regime controlled a \nterritory smaller than the former Russian empire, a grain harvest of \nforty six million tons was poor. As the Reds \nmoved southwards in September and October to concentrate their \nmilitary efforts upon General Wrangel, debate began about the ways \navailable to reconstruct the economy of Russia and the peripheral \nregions of the former empire. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. \nLenin remained extraordinarily complacent. As he \ncame to recognise the crisis for what it was, Lenin persisted with \nexisting measures. War Communism had to work better. It was \nKalinin, not Lenin, who insisted on 14 September that the Politburo \nshould establish a commission of enquiry into the conditions of the \npeasantry.27 Lenin stuck to the grain requisitioning, to the labour \narmies, to a virtual state monopoly in industry; he also reiterated his \ncommitment to attracting concessionnaires into the Russian economy.28 \nVisiting peasants, however, did not let Lenin forget them. By pitching the workers against the peasants, Lenin was setting \nup a situation like the fight between the goat and the ram, in which the \nlynx, whom Belyaev likened to world capitalism, could be the \nbeneficiary.30 Lenin's defence of official policy was not quite as \ndogged as usual. 31 Lenin hoped to indicate that the Politburo was mindful of the \npeasantry's distress. \nLenin rejoiced. \nThis gave Lenin the chance to re-think War Communism. Lenin edged his way towards a \nnew agrarian policy.38 In the Civil War the Bolsheviks had exacted taxes, \ngrain and conscripts from village communes as a whole. Compensation on an individual basis was thought to \nsmack of indulgence to the kulak; and, even though the committees of \nthe village poor were disbanded in Russia in December 1918, class \nstruggle in the countryside remained the state's conscious objective. Let \nus be clear about Lenin's new thinking.39 Opinions were divided, and Lenin and Preobrazhenski were \ninstructed on 20 December to draft a resolution on the agrarian \nquestion presentable to the Eighth Congress of Soviets.40 \nOn the same day Lenin gave a report to the Bolshevik fraction on \nforeign concessionnaires. He argued that they would not only assist \neconomic recovery but also divide the Soviet regime's enemies among \nthemselves.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. Lenin laid emphasis, \nas regards the threat from the west, upon improved relations with \nGermany. Not only the Workers' \nOpposition but many other Bolshevik speakers saw concessions as a \nbetrayal of the Revolution, the proletariat, Marx and communism.44 \nLenin had greatly misjudged the adaptiveness of his party. Lenin trimmed his report on behalf of \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSovnarkom of those aspects which had been most contentious. Disagreements in the \nCentral Committee about the trade unions were being aired at the \nCongress of Soviets; and Bolshevik delegates had to be carefully \ncourted if the Congress was not to turn into a fiasco. Strife returned to the Bolsheviks \nwith a vengeance. In vain did Lenin propose that 'the best politics \nhenceforward will be less politics'.45 \nWhat saved him from humiliation was the unreadiness of Bolsheviks \nto undo him in front of the small number of Mensheviks, Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Left SRs at the Congress. The Bolshevik party's \nmonopoly was not yet total, not quite. Furthermore, it did Lenin no harm \nthat these other socialist parties were asking for a reform of economic \npolicy more basic than Lenin's proposal.46 \nLenin dissociated himself from such an abandonment of War \nCommunism. He railed against peasants who became involved in what \nthe Bolsheviks called speculation.47 \nBut Lenin was still not out of the woods. Polemics on the agrarian \nquestion were almost inevitable even when Bolshevik delegates to the \nCongress were on their best behaviour. On 24 December, Lenin \nrepeated to a Bolshevik fraction meeting that a turn towards 'the \npeasant individual economy' was required.49 Even \nLenin, however, was taken aback at the vituperative discussion which \nensued. Despite his best efforts, the Bolshevik fraction at the Congress \nrejected the Lenin-Preobrazhenski proposals on the grounds that they \nfavoured only the kulak. Lenin was angry. \nThe Central Committee met in the emergency on 27 December, and \nLenin described in graphic detail how truculent the Bolshevik delegates \n Less Politics. \nLenin was empowered to go back to the fraction to re-assert the policy \nof the Central Committee.51 Lenin was \njaunty. Lenin was forceful in his contention that the oil-wells in \nBaku in Azerbaidzhan and in Grozny in the north Caucasus were in \nsuch ruin that 'extreme measures' such as the introduction of foreign \nconcessions were vital. Even so, it was only by eight votes to six that \nthe plan was accepted in principle by the Central Committee; and, as a \nsop to the critics, Lenin had to agree to Aleksei Rykov being asked to \ninvestigate how the Soviet republic would go about independently \nreconstructing the oil industry if the attempt were to be made. 57 \nAll was turmoil for Lenin, including his more intimate life. Her \ncorpse was conveyed by train to Moscow's Kazan Station at three \no'clock in the morning of II October 1920. Lenin was present and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfollowed the coffin through the cold, snow-laden streets.' 58 Lenin and Inessa probably had a sexual liaison \nof some kind before the Great War, and the emotional tie persisted.62 Whether Lenin reciprocated her attitude to him is not \nknown for certain. \n163 \ndiscussion', commenced on 30 December under the gaze of the \nBolshevik party fraction at the Congress of Soviets. Lenin and \nZinoviev stood together against Trotski. Lenin \nconcentrated his fire on Trotski.' Lenin declared that the working class still needed unions to \nprotect its interests. 67 \nLenin emphasised, in an off-the-cuff remark, that the Soviet state \nwas 'not a workers' but a workers' -and-peasants'' state. Bukharin obviously thought that he \ndetected a theoretical gaff, and made an interjection to Lenin's speech: \na rare occurrence by 1920. Before the October Revolution, Lenin had called for the \ninception of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest \npeasantry'. But Lenin disdained to enter \ndebate on the topic. \u00b7n \nLenin had come upon a formula that would see off his adversaries: it \nconveyed pride in the results of the October Revolution while \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that the workers had a continuing need of protection by \ntrade unions.76 The underlying explanation is that \nLenin stood for party unity and was able to portray Trotski as a \nsplitter. Trotski reacted \nby claiming that Lenin's indulgence to the unions was a rhetorical ploy. \nTo a large extent Trotski was right (even though it is equally true that \nLenin was hostile to the extreme anti-unionism of Trotski). And yet \nBolsheviks in the localities faced conditions which could no longer be \nhandled exclusively by command and violence. Yuri Milonov, the \nSamara provincial party leader was unwitting to call for the \nabrogation of the party's dominance over the soviets and trade \nunions; and E. lgnatov, a Bolshevik official in Moscow, wished to \nsupply the soviets with the right to veto appointments in the trade \nunions. Both baulked at the request of Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra \nKollontai for an equitable division of powers among party, soviets and \ntrade unions. The \nfreedom of the Lenin-versus-Trotski controversy was not extended to \nShlyapnikov. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd. 78 Lenin castigated \nShlyapnikov as an anti-party syndicalist and his ideas as a 'syndicalist \ndeviation' from Bolshevism.79 Lenin ignored the evidence. Shlyapnikov \ndid not want to abolish the Bolshevik party; his platform was not \ndesigned to entrust the working class with untrammeled power. He was \nnot a syndicalist, and Lenin knew it.80 \nLenin introduced a philosophical dimension to the discussion: \nalways a sign of his irritation. Comical \nas this is as a response to Bukharin's perfectly ordinary and innocent \nturn of speech, it was written in earnest: 'In parenthesis it is \nappropriate to note for the benefit of young party members,' asserted \nLenin, 'that it is impossible to become a conscious, real communist \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwithout studying -\nand truly studying -\neverything written by \nPlekhanov on philosophy since this is the best of the entire \ninternational literature of Marxism.'81 \nTOWARDS THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY \nThe 'trade union discussion' prolonged the diversion of the leadership's \nattention from problems which had begun to be addressed, however \nimperfectly, at the Ninth Party Conference of September 1920. A \nPolitburo decision was taken on 28 January 1921 enjoining Trotski and \nZinoviev, who were on an investigatory mission for the Council of \nLabour and Defence in the Urals, to relegate questions about the trade \nunions to the background. Resentment of Bolshevik political and \neconomic policies within a garrison that had supplied the shock troops \nfor the party in 1917 was reaching boiling point. The peasantry hated the \ncontinuation of the forcible requisitioning of food, the imposition of \nlabour duties and the military conscription of their young men; and \ntheir discontent was clearly focussed on the Bolshevik party and its \ncommissars.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A. Antonov, a local \n Less Politics. They were determined to \nsecure justice for their cause, and offered a still greater threat to Lenin \nand his associates in 1921 than they had to Kerenski in 1917.90 Siberia \nand the Caucasus were discussed;91 but it was Tambov that caused \ntrepidation in the Politburo.92 \nAt first sight it was a bit rich of Lenin to harass Tsyurupa. It is also clear that the striking workers and \nmutineering sailors did not yet unduly bother Lenin and his associates. Almost all the debates at the Politburo on 2 \nFebruary revolved around the clash between the peasantry and the \nregime. \nEqually interesting is the lack of Lenin's prominence in the debate.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.97 Since the October Revolution the tendency of \nBolshevik policy had been in the direction of reinforced state \nregulation of the economy. \nBut Lenin had been shaken into re-thinking his own attitudes more \nand more deeply. He had taken detailed notes on grievances expressed \nat a special meeting of non-Bolshevik peasant delegates at the Eighth \nCongress of Soviets on 22 December 1920.98 In addition, he visited \ncertain villages in Moscow province: Yaropolets on 14 November 1920 \nand Modenovo on 15 December 1920. \nPeasants also streamed into the capital seeking an audience with the \nSoviet leader throughout the winter of 1920-1921. Their memoirs were to be written within a political \nenvironment that brooked no criticism of the Bolshevik party and \nSoviet government; and, in any case, the nature of his office was bound \nto deter people from speaking frankly even to a man of Lenin's \nrenowned approachability. 102 The first Bolshevik \nofficial to do so in Lenin's presence was V. 103 \nDid Sokolov finally change Lenin's mind. \nAt a conference of metal-workers on 4 February 1921 Lenin merely \nhinted at the direction of his thought. 107 It was at \nthis meeting that Lenin, having listened to a report by Deputy People's \nCommissar for Agriculture N. Lenin's jottings \nwere the basis of what became known as the New Economic Policy. \nLenin's draft was scribbled out on a single sheet of paper and handed \nto a working party consisting of Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Osinski. 110 No \nPolitburo resolution was recorded on the proposed change of policy; \nand Lenin, in contrast with his behaviour in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, held back from joining this crucial working party. Already the Bolsheviks were at sixes and sevens \nabout the trade unions; and, at a moment of peasant revolts, Lenin had \nto handle his collapsible party with extreme care. \nPolitburo meetings throughout February decided the personnel and \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \npractical measures needed to crush the resistance to Bolshevik party \npower. 113 \nOn 16 February 1921 the Politburo decided to sanction a press \ndebate on the pros and cons of a tax in kind. A cautious approach was \nmaintained: the participants would be lesser Bolsheviks and not the \nparty's leaders. Several amend-\nments had been made to Lenin's sketch. 122 It was a blow for the consensus achieved in the Politburo; \nbut even Lenin, while disagreeing with Tsyurupa, had opposed the re-\nemergence of middlemen who would take grain for sale in other towns. An entire economy run from Moscow remained \nthe objective. 123 \nNevertheless Lenin might not have reconciled the Party Congress to \nthe tax in kind if popular rebellions had not intensified. It was by no \nmeans universally accepted in the party that a lowered level of state-\nprocured grain would alleviate urban food-supply difficulties; and the \nvehemence of the Bolshevik fraction's reaction to the much milder \nproposal for agrarian reform made by Lenin and Preobrazhenski at the \nEighth Congress of Soviets lingered in the Politburo's memory. Strikes and food \nshortages shook the minds of all Bolsheviks in Moscow. Strikes broke out \nin Petrograd, and an anti-Bolshevik leaflet campaign had been \norganised. The original advocates \nof the tax were denounced by some Bolshevik activists as being \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSocialist Revolutionaries (as indeed Sokolov had once been);128 and \nthe tax was said to involve a re-installation of 'bourgeois relations' in \nthe economy (as in fact it did). 129 From Bolshevik leaders in the \nUkraine, including the entire Ukrainian Central Committee, there had \ncome a protest that a tax in kind would impede the People's \nCommissariat of Food Supplies from extricating any grain whatsoever \nfrom the peasants at a time of an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt across \nthe southern provinces.130 \nBut Lenin held firm.131 Nor did he fait to \nemphasise that the contents of the Ukrainian Bolshevik protest had \nacknowledged that the local working-class population already \ndemanded such a reform so that they could barter with the \npeasantry. Lenin had pushed through a reform by \nmethods different from those used in his victory over the Brest-Litovsk \ntreaty. But it is equally true that, if Lenin had not headed the \ncampaign for reform, the proposal would probably not have reached \nthe agenda sheet of the Tenth Party Congress. \nLENIN'S COHORT \nThe party remained in a condition of shock at the divergence between \nLenin and Trotski over the trade unions. \n173 \nthe country who grew up thinking that the October Revolution had \nbeen led by an individual called 'Lenintrotski' .135 In 1918, during the \nBrest-Litovsk disrute, Lenin and Trotski had avoided trenchant \nmutual criticisms. \nLenin and Trotski knew that such a menace was not as acute as it \nappeared. Trotski had been asked by Lenin in the October Revolution \nto become People's Commissar for Internal Affairs. To be sure, he may have been exaggerating concern \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nabout his ethnic origin in order to avoid receiving certain posts.144 \nFurthermore, his readiness to turn the party upside down in pursuit of \nhis preferred policies was demonstrated by the 'trade union discussion'; \nand his behaviour after Lenin's death hardly betokens a person \nreluctant to inherit the position of dominant party leader. \nNevertheless in the winter of 1920-1921, while Lenin enjoyed the \nappearance of good health, Trotski fought him over policy only; there \nwas no attempt to reduce Lenin in importance. \nTrotski was undoubtedly putting a sincere case, and he was right to \nargue that the trade-union question touched on almost every aspect of \nthe party's strategy: state power, economic reconstruction, workers' \nrights, local self-government; but he should also have known that the \naverage party official, tried and tested in the heat of the military \nconflict of 1917-1920, felt that debate was a luxury which was ill-\naffordable by the Bolsheviks. Scarcely a month \npassed when Lenin omitted to make such a comment.145 Lenin wanted the same objective, \nbut omitted to say this directly: the term was repugnant to the Marxist \ntradition. Instead the \ntalk among Bolshevik party officials was that, with his power-base in \nthe Red Army, he might become the Napoleon of the Soviet regime. \nBolsheviks thought much about the precedents in the history of the \nFrench Revolution. Trotski's non-Bolshevik past and his abrasive \ntreatment of the party in 1918-1920 gave grounds for the fear that a \nBonapartist counterrevolution might be undertaken under his leader-\nship.J46 \nLenin meanwhile gained from his evident wish to deflect the party \nfrom a damaging discussion. \n175 \nas if the sole way open to them to prove that they were still Joyal \nBolsheviks was to refer affectionately to 'Vladimir Ilich' . Those Bolsheviks who \nhad been at the front in the Civil War, he emphasised, had scant \nunderstanding of conditions and possibilities in the rear. Lenin would have certainly have done so if \nhe thought he could have got away with it. 151 This group, forced to \ncome off the fence dividing Lenin and Trotski, scared Lenin in 1921 by \ndeciding initially in favour of Trotski. Lenin revelled in verbal \nambiguity. At a time of strikes and mutinies there could be little \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprospect of prolonging their existence, and Trotski complied. Party organisation after organisation, despite \nTrotski's visits to them in person, came over to Lenin's side. Here Lenin put the case that \nTrotski should be included on their slate for election since he would be \nin a permanent minority in the Central Committee and disabled from \ncausing a split in the party. But Lenin also insisted that the main supporters ofTrotski \nshould be removed; Krestinski, Preobrazhenski, Serebryakov and \nI. Lenin must already have had it in mind to give full \nmembership in the Politburo to Zinoviev in return for his part in \nTrotski's defeat, and discussions were under way to fill the Secretariat \nwith officials who had taken Lenin's line in the winter of 1920-1921.'59 \nIn addition, Lenin planned to call a meeting of all those who agreed \nwith him on the trade unions. Lenin was amused: 'What's this I hear from a died-in-the-wool old \nfactionalist. \nAt the evening session Lenin delivered the long-awaited Central \nCommittee political report. 16s \nLenin's implicit argument was that the peasantry's capacity to \ndestabilise the authorities had been underestimated. Lenin declared that the \nfactional disagreements in the Bolshevik party were an intellectual \nluxury. Lenin described it as a 'petit-bourgeois counter-\nrevolution' more dangerous than the White invasions of Kolchak, \nDenikin and Yudenich. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry. Lenin stressed that such a tax had been \nintroduced into law in October 1918, but had proved impractical in the \nCivil War. 171 The \nreal drama lay with Lenin's strategical change since the previous \nCongress. Skvortsov-Stepanov, Lenin had set \nthe programme for the proceedings. Lenin's attitude to the Workers' \nOpposition would only cause further disunity. Osinski, for the Democratic Centralists, \nagreed with Lenin that syndicalism had grown as a force in the \nparty. Nor was Lenin immune from criticism. Sosnovski, a supporter of Trotski in the trade-union contro-\nversy, quipped that Lenin had barely mentioned the workers.176 Back came Yuri Milonov for the \nWorkers' Opposition, claiming that Lenin as Sovnarkom chairman \n Less Politics. It was his contention that the strict line on the trade unions \naccepted by Lenin at the previous Party Congress was responsible for \nstimulating working-class discontent. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin. In Moscow, as he pointed out, 'the arch-democrat Stalin' \nhad been organising Lenin's faction as if an internal party war were \nbeing fought. Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends. When the \ntime arrived for Lenin to respond to his critics, he was ill-disposed to \ncompromise. With the recent conquest of the Transcaucasus in \neveryone's mind, Stalin stressed the party's objective of equal rights for \nall nationalities; and he expatiated a bit on the tendency of several \nRussian Bolsheviks to indulge in 'Russian Great-Power chauvinism'. 185 \nFurthermore, Lenin in 1921 would indubitably have been annoyed by \nStalin's dismissiveness about national self-determination. The slogan \nremained dear to Lenin. Zatonski from the Ukraine argued against the creeping \nGreat Russian chauvinism and stated that Stalin seemed to deny that \nany republics independent from Moscow were conceivable. He also \nconfessed that he himself, a Bolshevik leader, failed to understand the \nprecise nature of the treaty between Soviet Russia and Soviet \nUkraine. He thereby \ngave the impression of being closer in thinking to Lenin than was \nstrictly true. Still Lenin kept himself out of the \nway. \nLenin played his part again. 195 \nNothing was left to chance, and Lenin on the same day as the last of \nthe emergency sessions penned drafts of his two motions on the \nsyndicalist deviation and on party unity. He emphasised that in February 1920, so far \nfrom being unorthodox as a Bolshevik, he had put forward a version of \neconomic reform not totally dissimilar from the current proposal to \nabolish grain requisitioning; he revealed also that Lenin at the time had \naccused him of 'Free Trade-ism'.202 \nTrotski retorted very reasonably that he had infringed no disciplinary \ncode; he quoted, too, Lenin's statement at the Ninth Party Congress \nagainst the 'rubbish' spoken on behalf of democratic practices in the \ntrade unions. As \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe went down to the expected defeat, he lamely declared that the trade-\nunion resolution would not survive in effect through to the Eleventh \nParty Congress. \nOnly then did Lenin step forward with the Central Committee report \non the end to grain requisitioning. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'.206 At present the peasants were \ndiscontented, and Lenin added: 'Classes cannot be tricked.' The 'final \nsuccess' of socialist revolution in the Soviet republic still depended on \nthe timely outbreak of revolutions 'in one or several advanced \ncountries'; but a second and equally important prerequisite was the \ncreation of an 'agreement' between the proletariat and the mass of the \npeasantry. 213 He also implicitly challenged \nLenin's assumption that the new policy would somehow be more \norderly in implementation.214 \nTwo speakers followed in Lenin's support, including Evgeni \nPreobrazhenski: the Bolshevik Left contained many who saw that \nsome reform was urgently necessary. Frumkin, who \nworked under Tsyurupa in the People's Commissariat of Food \nSupplies, argued that Lenin's proposal would condemn workers to \ndeath by starvation. 215 \nLenin's summary speech at the end was characteristically combative. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'. It was tantamount to stating \nthat the October Revolution should search fondly for fraternal \ncapitalist regimes. Manuilski demanded \nthat Lenin's policy should be accepted only with the proviso that it \ncould be substantially modified in response to local conditions.218 \nLenin had handled the Congress superbly. He had \nmade an appeal for unity in the face of a tremendous economic and \n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitical crisis; and he had slipped his proposal to terminate grain \nrequisitioning to the end of an overloaded agenda. Lenin was \nvital to the re-orientation of policies.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'. It was Kamenev's contention that, with Russia's re-entry into \nthe world economic system, capitalism's own post-war recovery would \nbe prevented.220 And yet even he, the leading figure on the Bolshevik \nRight, took a stern view. Then, in the closing minutes, Lenin quickly \nintroduced the two debates on party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist \ndeviation.", "Land_Nationalisation_1905": " Consequently the semi-\nconstitutional manoeuvres of 1905-6 were probably the nearest that \nthe imperial government could prudently move towards the main-\ntenance of its centuries-old prerogatives. 76 The Conference also discussed the agrarian \nquestion. The record of his speech is not \navailable; it is not known whether he tried to present the case for land \nnationalisation. \nLenin's report proposed land nationalisation. Abandoning \nreference to nationalisation, he called for the land to become 'the \ncommon property of the entire people' . And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from 1906, that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October 1917 by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions.", "Tsar_1905": " Yet such \nrecommendations overestimated the power available to the tsarist \ngovernment.

And Lenin felt that the Central \nCommittee, with its anti-emigre animus, deliberately kept him short of \nassistants and financial support.lO \nLenin was irate that no one had even asked his opinion. \nThey had plans, well before the Manifesto, to start a legal Bolshevik \nnewspaper based in Russia (and perhaps its creation would have \ncompelled Lenin to go back to St. But there was another Lenin \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \n(and many more besides). In the second half of 1905 it was this Lenin who \ncame to the fore. He now claimed, to Bogdanov's bemusement, to be \nquite unbothered by the prospect of joining up again with the \nMensheviks; he even chided those Bolsheviks who 'exaggerated' the \npoints of dispute between the two factions.15 Bogdanov too wanted to \nsecure Bolshevik dominance inside a re-unified social-democratic \nparty; but many local groups of Bolsheviks were destroying his \nbargaining position by recombining with Menshevik groups without \nthe Central Committee's permission.1S Lenin by contrast was almost benign. He conceded that the \nBolshevik Central Committee (as if he himself had played no role in \nthe matter) had in the past unfairly cashiered social-democratic \ncommittees led by Mensheviks. Lenin \nwanted to delay it until spring 1906; but he again noted ruefully that \nthe Central Committee had not invited his advice.1s He worried even \nmore about the attitude of many Bolsheviks to non-party working-\nclass organisations. Lenin did not endorse \ntheir general viewpoint any more than previously; but he shared the \npriority given by Martov and Akselrod to ensuring that social-\ndemocrats did not let other political parties dominate the organisations \nof the Russian labour movement.19 Lenin now welcomed the Men-\nsheviks in the party as a means of putting pressure on his own \nBolsheviks to bend more readily in his own direction of policy. Petersburg.21 He \nalready knew of the Petersburg Soviet. He brought with him a draft \narticle advocating Bolshevik participation, expecting to get it pub-\nlished in Novaya Zhizn. Lenin now learnt, for the first time, the \ndetails of the Central Committee's recent activity. The Central Committee had thereupon urged all \nBolsheviks to withdraw from the Soviet.24 It took weeks for Lenin to \nsoften this intransigence. It \ncould hardly have been otherwise; the Bolsheviks, if ever they were \ngoing to organise an insurrection, were bound to have to enter mass \nworking-class organisations. \nLenin himself, possibly under Central Committee pressure, attended \nthe Soviet only infrequently. Trotski's name, not Lenin's, \nwas on Petersburg workers' lips. \nON PHILOSOPHY AND ON THE SOVIETS \nLenin and Bogdanov announced their differences over soviets and \ntrade unions as being of secondary importance in the winter of 1905-6; \nthe overriding task was to prepare an uprising to instal a provisional \nrevolutionary government. This consensus fortified Lenin's factional \nloyalty. He, the founder of Bolshevism, knew \nscarcely any Bolshevik leader in st. In epistemology, Lenin sided with \nPlekhanov. So far, \nBogdanov and Lenin were in agreement. Bogdanov linked their outlook with \nMarxism.37 \nNevertheless Lenin and Bogdanov concurred that philosophical \ndisagreements need not affect their political alliance.3S Lenin expressed outrage when Plekhanov \ndeclared that a causal link existed between Bogdanov's 'subjectivist' \nphilosophy and his 'voluntarist' pursuit of a revolutionary dictator-\nship.39 \nLenin was of the opinion, all the same, that Bogdanov lacked the \nintellectual flexibility appropriate to the politician. Free-ranging in philosophy, Bogdanov in 1905 \nwas dogmatic about the concept of the 'vanguard party'. If the soviets \nwould not accept leadership from the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party, he implied, then too bad for the soviets.40 And too bad \nalso for the workers who elected delegates to those same soviets. He \nwas as doctrinaire about this as any Bolshevik hardliner (even though \nsuch an attitude was not in fact a logically unavoidable conclusion to be \ndrawn from What Is To Be Done. Lenin's view, as sketched in \nNovember 1905 and elaborated in his 1906 pamphlet Victory of the \n Predicting the Tide \n145 \nKadets, was different: he wanted the soviets to act as 'the embryos of \nthe new revolutionary power' . The Petersburg Soviet should initiate the process \nby selecting representatives to announce themselves as 'the pro-\nvisional revolutionary government of all Russia' . The \nsoviet, he declared, was a 'fighting organisation for the attainment of \nspecific goals'. Lenin's reactions tugged him in opposing directions. Lenin, \nwho had once sung the praises of the 'professional revolutionary', \nwanted to fling open the gates of the party to ordinary, inexperienced \nworkers without a smattering of Marxist doctrine: all to prod the \ncommittees out of their 'inertia' .50 \nYet Lenin simultaneously repeated that the party alone was the re-\npository of revolutionary wisdom. \nOrganisational discipline too had to be preserved; and party com-\n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmittees should ensure that their activists in the soviets toed the party \nline.52 Lenin occasionally spoke as if it was a pity that Bolsheviks had to \njoin the soviets at all.53 \nConsequently Lenin, however far he swam out towards the notion \nthat the working class was Marxist by instinct, did not toss away his \nlifebelt of traditional Bolshevism; and, though he had pragmatic \nreasons for continuing with his overtures to the Mensheviks, he still \nalso conceived of Menshevism itself as an impractical strategy. He \ncensured Akselrod, Dan and Martov even though they were the party's \nonly theorists who produced articles which prefigured the emergence \nof the soviets in late 1905. Like Trotski, Lenin thought that the \n'democratic dictatorship' could be installed only by simultaneous \nprocesses of central direction and local self-organisation.56 \nFAILURE OF INSURRECTION \nIf Lenin's thinking in 1905 was more tension-laden than was custom-\nary even for him, it must be appreciated that Russian politics changed \nwith bewildering rapidity inside a few months. Lenin was an active politician, not an armchair commen-\ntator. Since Lenin was \nconcerned lest the Bolsheviks might float adrift of working-class \nopinion, it was natural for him to make a strong case for the instinctive \nvirtues of the factory labourer. \nBefore 1905 he had experienced small difficulty in communicating \npolicies to his Bolsheviks; but his editorial job in Novaya Zhizn, upon \nhis return to Russia, was in the gift of a Central Committee suspicious \nof his pro-soviet enthusiasms. Semen Shvarts \nwas then a Bolshevik agitator in the capital.58 Many Bolshevik committee-men at \nlower levels shared the Central Committee's distrust of non-party \norganisations. On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. Soviets should be treated \nmerely as 'the technical apparatus' for carrying the party's leadership \nto the working class. The months \nfrom October to December witnessed the entrance of Bolsheviks into \nmore mass organisations such as the trade unions and the soviets. They helped in \nstrengthening the Moscow Soviet in December (which contrasted with \ntheir behaviour in St. \nThe Petersburg Soviet's life was ended as suddenly as it had begun.61 \nLenin's influence over events in St. The Moscow Bolsheviks, who held the party's city \ncommittee, decided to mount an insurrection before the authorities \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrepeated their attempt at suppressing revolutionary activity.62 The \nMoscow Soviet sanctioned the uprising. Lenin's doubts, expressed in early autumn, had proved \nwell-founded. \nTAMPERE AND THE DUMA \nWhile insurrection took place in Moscow, a Conference of Bolsheviks \nwas being held to the north. Petersburg. Lenin was elected as Conference chairman; his deputies were \nB. Insurrection remained the Bolshevik \npriority.69 Initially there were two dissenters: Gorev and Lenin. They \nviewed a policy of boycott as yet another sign of the Bolsheviks' naive \ninflexibility. Lenin had dreaded this since summer. \nLenin's attitude was less rigid. Like all Bolsheviks, he denounced the \nlaw's provisions as a mockery of constitutionalism. Lenin continued to discuss the \nmatter with other delegates. He turned to Lenin for backing. Lenin \nsaid he had changed his mind.73 \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction. \nMensheviks often remarked that Lenin could not abide to work \nalongside leaders of intellectmll prowess equal to his own. The secret \nof his alleged domination over all things Bolshevik, it was asserted, lay \npartly with his ability to beguile committee-men of inadequate formal \neducation. Undoubtedly Lenin deployed his erudition to advantage. Among the boycottist leaders at the \nConference was Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin, whose lack of a university \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndegree in no way inhibited him from expressing himself forcefully. \nMen of humble social origin were legion in the Bolshevik faction. Throughout his career as a party \nboss, Lenin had to take their feelings into account. The reporter was Lenin.77 Negotiations between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks followed \nhard on the Conference. Lenin and Martov were present.78 Lenin also loyally pressed the \nBolshevik argument for boycotting the Duma. \nIronically, he made a case not dissimilar from Lenin's earlier one: that \nthe Duma elections should be exploited as an instrument for revolu-\ntionary self-organisation by the working class. Bolshevik opposition, \nhowever, was strong; and the Mensheviks, being themselves suspicious \nabout the Duma, bowed to their arguments. The successful candidates, \nin order of popularity, were Plekhanov, Dan and Lenin.87 \nHe knew to expect criticism from the Mensheviks, and was quite happy \n 152 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto be provocative.9o \nThe disagreement between Maslov and Lenin over agrarian policy \nreflected differing expectations about the post-tsarist Russian state.91 Lenin, as a Bolshevik, envisaged a \ndifferent scenario. Discussion \ncovered the entirety of Russian history.94 Lenin had challenged this view in the 1890s. Suddenly, a \ndecade later, his historiographical differences with Plekhanov were \nseen to underpin a question of enormous immediate relevance: what \nwas the nature of this tsarist state and how best could social-democrats \ndismantle it. This was that \n Predicting the Tide \n153 \nLenin, for all his agro-economic expertise, was unable to keep most \nBolsheviks with him. Suvorov, a Bolshevik who was politically and philosophically \nclose to Bogdanov, baulked at land nationalisation; instead he \nproposed a scheme which would designate all agricuituralland as the \nproperty of the peasantry. Such Bolsheviks considered it impossible to \nprevent the peasantry from appropriating whatever they wanted in the \ncountryside once the revolutionary conflagration had begun.98 Lenin \ncame some way to accommodating Suvorov's objection.99 But most Bolsheviks stayed \nwith Suvorov. And Lenin, thinking Suvorov's ideas to be incorrect but \nnot fundamentally damaging to Bolshevik strategy, voted in his \nsupport and against Maslov. Not only \ndoes it show us Lenin the practical politician under pressure to back \npolicies which were not entirely to his liking. It also reveals how, even \non a major question of policy such as land tenure, Lenin was not the \nmaster of the Bolshevik faction. And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from 1906, that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October 1917 by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions.lOl Bolshevik attitudes remained under fire. Already in the \nCongress, Lenin had been accused by Plekhanov of talking like a \nsocialist -revol utionary . Lenin's insurrectionism was said to have blinded him to \nother political opportunities. 103 This made painful listening for Lenin; \nit had been the Central Committee, not he, which had been reluctant to \nparticipate in the soviets in 1905. But Martynov's mistake also brought \nadvantages to Lenin. This was Akselrod's \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreport on the Duma.l04 Lenin led off for the Bolsheviks in reply. He retained reservations about Bolshevik policy; \nbut factional ties prevented him from stating them openly.llo \nLenin accepted the result with equanimity.lll He also \nannounced that he did not believe that Bolsheviks and Mensheviks \ncould not work together in the same party. They spoke against the \narmed robberies that the Bolsheviks had undertaken to increase their \nfaction's treasury. Unlike the majority of Bolsheviks present, Lenin sided with \nthe Mensheviks. Negotiations evinced an accord to include seven Men-\nsheviks and three Bolsheviks in the Central Committee. Lenin was not \namong them. The Bolsheviks chosen were Desnitski, Krasin and \nRykov (who was to be replaced by Bogdanov upon his release from \nprison). It was possibly a signal from his factional associates that he and \nhis close supporters had moved too far away from their line of policy; \nbut they cannot have felt extremely strongly about this since he \ncontinued for the rest of 1906 to assume a leading position, alongside \nBogdanov and Krasin, in Bolshevik discussions. His energies were to be reserved for his widely-acknowledged \nspecialism: editing Bolshevik newspapers and other publications.119 \nAt any rate, the entire Bolshevik leadership was at least agreed on the \nneed to maintain an autonomous factional central apparatus inside the \nformally re-united party. A Bolshevik Centre was secretly established. \nLenin found the Congress less gratifying.", "Bolshevik_Leadership_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.3 Lenin concluded: 'All hopes of a peaceful development of the \nRussian revolution have disappeared definitively.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. Representatives of the \nparty's localleaderships of Moscow and Petrograd as well as Central \nBureau of the Military Organisation also attended. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.6 Even the April Party Confer-\nence had given no absolute commitment to rule by soviets;7 and in \nThe State and Revolution, written in the months after the July Days, \nLenin had barely mentioned the soviets. Only Sverdlov fully accepted Lenin's view-\npoint immediately after the July Days.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. In addition, the party had \ninvested its energies in persuading workers that 'soviet power' was \nthe noblest objective; and the practical difficulties of justifying \nLenin's proposed change of slogans, when Bolshevik activists spoke \nat open mass meetings, would be considerable. 10 \nLenin wrote a short article, 'On Slogans', in reply and condemned \nthe Central Committee for what he saw as a lack of tactical \nflexibility.\" 'On Slogans' was published by the Kronstadt \nBolsheviks, and reached a number of activists in the provinces. 12 \nLenin's efforts did not go unrewarded; and a shift towards his stance \nhad in any case been occurring in the Central Committee even before \n The Fire Next Time \n203 \n'On Slogans' became widely known.14 Yet he affirmed that the ultimate objective remained the same: \nnamely to establish a socialist administration of soviets. 16 \nYet Lenin's fortunes were not as bad as they seemed. Perhaps this clarifica-\ntion (or modification, if Ordzhonikidze's statement in his memoirs \nabout the factory-workshop committees is to be believed)18 nudged \nStalin and the Central Committee majority towards accepting that \nLenin's hostility to the 'All Power to the Soviets. Lenin's Bolshevik critics may also \nhave been reassured to note that he acknowledged that an immediate \ninsurrection was impracticable.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets.20 Lenin and Zinoviev could not risk the journey; \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Trotski, Lunacharski and Kamenev were in prison.21 \nThe decree was not unwelcome to Lenin inasmuch as it dissuaded \nBolshevik critics from continuing to demand that he should deliver \nhimself up to the authorities.24 Lenin's physical absence did not \npreclude his political semi-presence. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. A troika of leaders guided \nthe debates at the Congress: Sverdlov, Stalin and Bukharin. His \nmain aim was to show that the Bolshevik leadership had not \nprovoked the clashes on the streets of the capital in early July. But the Moscow-based \nCentral Committee member V. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. In such a \ncontingency, according to Bukharin, the Bolsheviks would have to \nfight a defensive revolutionary war against the Germans.34 Lenin, while sharing Osinski's concern intellectually, \nwould surely have approved of Bukharin's tactful reticence. He mentioned that 'certain comrades' still believed \ni~ to be 'utopian to raise the ,question of socialist revolution' in \nRussia. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. Whereas Lenin had held forth about the era of \nimperialism and the imminence of European socialist revolution, \nStalin addressed the specificity of Russia. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. Martov, too, could see no \nsalvation coming from further collaboration with the Russian \nbourgeoisie. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed.

'52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential.61 Here \nLenin would probably have sympathised with Preobrazhenski's basic \npoint. Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. All \nthese four were in hiding or in prison: Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and \nTrotski. Trotski, who had only recently become a \nBolshevik, now joined the central party leadership. The Bolshevik right, which had been strongly represented in \nthe central party body after the Seventh Conference in April, had lost \nground. As Lenin put his thoughts in order for a seizure \nof power and for a programme of social and economic reforms, he \ncould look to a more receptive set of colleagues than he had \npossessed since entering the politics of Russian Marxism. \nKERENSKI AND KORNILOV \nDespite the dispute over slogans, no Bolshevik at the Congress gave \nthe impression of expecting to take power in the immediate future. If \nLenin had been there, things might have been different. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. For Lenin, this proved conclusively that \nthe Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were collaborating \nwith the forces of counter-revolution.64 Kerenski's policies, even \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthough Lenin exaggerated, undoubtedly moved rightwards. The sole major omission from the list of \nparticipants was the Bolshevik party.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. A counter-\nrevolutionary mutiny had restored them to free activity in the \ncapital; the sole major Bolshevik who could not afford to appear \nin the open was Lenin.70 \nLenin, analysing the events as reported in the press, swung between \ninterpretations. Accordingly, Kerenski badly \n11eeded to mend his fences with the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries in the soviets. The rising influence of the Mensheviks and \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries induced even Lenin to raise, on 1 \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSeptember, the question of whether a peaceful development of the \nrevolution was possible. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 73 \nLenin noted that peaceful revolutions, while being rare, were not \ninconceivable. 74 \nIt was an intriguing phase in Lenin's career. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. By 12 September \nhe was writing 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power' and demanded an \nimmediate uprising; and, on 14 September, he repeated this call in \n'Marxism and Insurrection';77 both documents were letters addressed \nto the Central Committee. Thus the 'peaceful \ndevelopment' of the revolution sketched by Lenin would have started \nonly after a violent phase had been endured. His \nfirst justification was that both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets \nhad acquired Bolshevik working majorities earlier in the month.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.82 Kamenev and Trotski, who had both been released \nfrom prison, were nominated as Bolshevik spokesmen and required \nto demand the removal of Kerenski and the installation of a \ngovernment composed entirely of socialists.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Trotski, too, was \nmoving towards such a standpoint and earned a plaudit from Lenin \nfor the taunts he flung at the non-Bolshevik socialists at the \nDemocratic Conference: 'Bravo, comrade Trotski.'84 But even \nTrotski believed that insurrection could not immediately be under-\ntaken, and the Central Committee as a whole resisted Lenin's \nproposal. It \nwas as if Lenin had been the boss of a gang intent on robbing a bank \nwho had incautiously confided his intentions to paper - his fellow \ngang-members wished to destroy the incriminating evidence.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise. 86 Thus the Central Committee deftly used the prestige \nand authority of 'Lenin' to oppose Lenin. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Through the first weeks of October there was a series of \nvictories for the Bolsheviks in elections to the various mass \norganisations.92 \nTo be sure, these pro-Bolshevik voters were not wholly conscious \nof the nature of Bolshevism; and, outside Russia and the Russian-\ndominated cities in the peripheral regions of the old empire, direct \nsupport for the party was minuscule. Lenin's affirmation that 'the \nmajority of the people' favoured the Bolsheviks lacked cogency. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. \nLenin's insistence that time was not on the side of the Bolshevik \nparty is therefore hard to explain. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. \n'THE STATE AND REVOLUTION' \nLenin's hardheaded campaign for what he saw as his party's interests \nwas one aspect of a multifaceted political personality. The State and \nRevolution was the most refined embodiment of Lenin's strategy for \nthe carrying through of a socialist transformation in modern \nindustrial societies. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. As Lenin pointed out, Marxism's co-founders \nbelieved that every society since the ending of ancient communism \nhad been divided into rival classes.98 \nLenin's second chapter discussed the viewpoint of Marx and \nEngels on the revolutionary upsurge across Europe in 1848-51. Lenin retailed the characteristics approved by Marx. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. 106 By \nany standard this was hyper-confidence; the return to Russia in 1917 \nhad reinforced his sanguine earlier hopes as articulated in 'Marxism \non the State'. 110 \nAs a Marxist, Lenin wanted to examine 'the economic founda-\ntions' for this withering away. But Lenin was writing for \nMarxists, who needed no persuasion on such issues. 114 According to Lenin, Kautsky had \nP. This \nnaturally raised the question of why Lenin had not criticised such \nalleged neglect before 1914.115 On the other hand, Lenin recognised that \nAnton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Radek had convinc-\n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \ningly exposed Kautsky's 'passive radicalism' before the war.118 This was a reference to the absence of a description of the \n'dictatorship of the proletariat' in general and the soviets in \nparticular. It also made Lenin's State and Revolution seem more \noriginal than it was. Bukharin's name was not mentioned even \nthough his wartime reconsiderations of Marxism had been influen-\ntial in leading Lenin to the basis of his new contentions.'2\u00b0 Non-Bolsheviks felt no such \ninhibition.124 \nMartov's examination of such texts matched Lenin in exegetical \nskill. Martov delighted in exposing Lenin's sleights of hand. Indeed, Lenin saw himself as offering a vision \nof a totally harmonious and self-regulating society which was \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrealisable within a not too lengthy period; and he anticipated a more \nor less easy, trouble-free socialist revolution. 133 \nHis non-Bolshevik critics, however, did not limit themselves to \nMarxology. Moreover, Lenin's \ntwo antagonists did not share the unargued premise of his book that \neach class would gravitate permanently towards support for a single \nparty. The State and Revolution did not mention parties at all; and \nKautsky and Martov were introducing data from 1918, when a one-\nparty state became an enduring phenomenon in Russia. 139 \nLenin very probably had no conscious intention that a socialist \ndictatorship should undertake a large-scale and bloody repression; \nbut this only serves to demonstrate the facile quality of his thinking: \nthe objective likelihood of such a dictatorship having to turn to \nterrorist methods in order to sustain its power was strong. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Lenin failed, for \nexample, to explain how the local soviets would interact with central \nsoviet organs after the revolution. \nIt is not sensible to assume, as Lenin did, that administrators can \nbe prevented from forming themselves into a corporate group (or \ninto groups) simply by insisting on electivity, on the right of instant \nrecall and on payment at a worker's rate. Kautsky put it in a nutshell when he retortc;d to Lenin that \nclasses can rule but cannot govern; and that mass participatory \nqemocracy is utopian. Yet what \nwas the relationship between such theory and subsequent Russian \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhistory. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Lenin's offering was a strange \nconcoction. Russia was not the exclusive \nfocus; and, when he started taking notes on socialist revolution in \nJanuary 1917, Lenin must have had Germany more firmly in mind \nthan his native land. All therefore knew of Lenin's \nintentions with the utmost clarity. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. \nHe knew only too well that the old Russian empire's population \nwas constituted predominantly by peasants, and wished as a Marxist \ntheorist to take account of the fact. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. The second \npoint is that Lenin apparently made only eight explicit references to \ndictatorship from the start of September through to 25 October159 -\nnot a enormous number in view of the topic's importance. \nIn addition, all those references occurred in the carefully-composed \nprose of Bolshevik newspaper articles and pamphlets. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Yet the result was that the great mass of workers and \npeasants outside the Bolshevik party can scarcely have known about \nhis full range of plans. This can hardly have been fortuitous; Lenin \ncannot have wanted to upset popular sensibilities unnecessarily, and \nthe virtues of dictatorship would not automatically have commended \nthemselves to the Russian working class. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. And so, whereas the general population - probably \nincluding most rank-and-file Bolsheviks- was unaware of his fiercer \nintentions, careful and regular readers should have picked up the \nmessage. 166 \nLenin, indeed, did not stop short of anticipating the use of 'terror' \nin Russia. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Lenin wanted the \nlaw changed so that 'the exploiters (i. For most of the year, however, he preferred to avoid the \ntopic altogether or to concentrate on what he described as the terror \nbeing perpetrated against the Bolsheviks by the Provisional Govern-\nment. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. He omitted to \nsay what he would do if this vanguard were to turn against the \nBolsheviks and favour other parties; he had developed no ideas of \nmulti-party competition. \nNATIONALITY PROJECTS \nLenin beat the drum about the struggle for political revolution, \nsummoning workers, peasants and soldiers to overthrow the Provi-\nsional Government; but the rhythms of the national question were \nnot forgotten by him. The Provisional Government \nand its Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary supporters were \nfearful lest the Bolsheviks should take advantage of its difficulties \n The Fire Next Time \n229 \nwith some of the non-Russian nationalities. Such conflict \nwas grist in Lenin's mill, and after the Seventh Bolshevik Party \nConference he continued to demand that all nations in the old \nRussian empire should be accorded the right of secession. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. 196 \nAnd yet we should be wary of assuming that even Lenin made \nnational self-determination into a prominently visible plank in his \nplatform. Possibly he \nrecognised that the future boundaries of the old imperial state were \nbeyond prediction and that emphatic talk by Bolsheviks about the \nright of secession might induce more secessions than would otherwise \noccur: he explicitly avoided offering a set of 'demands' on behalf of \nspecific nationalities. Leading Bolsheviks privately asked him to \nclarify his policy; but he argued that it was more advisable to limit \nthe party's pronouncements to a simple 'declaration of principles' \n(and even then he published this prevaricatory remark not in a mass-\ncirculation newspaper or at an open mass meeting but in the low-\ncirculation 'thick journal' Enlightenment, which was read mainly by \nBolshevik intellectuals).201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. Lenin \ndid precisely that. All Bolsheviks saw that the \neconomy's rapid deterioration was a crucial issue in the struggle \namong the political parties, and Lenin was his party's major \neconomic spokesman. He got down to elaborating his ideas from \nearly summer 1917. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint.206 Lenin railed against \nthe greed and selfishness of businessmen. His \n The Fire Next Time \n233 \nwritings contrasted with those of Bolshevik economists such as V. In \nfairness to him, it must be said that his criticism of Russian \ncontemporary commentators who had ignored this ph~nomenon \nhad had a great deal of cogency in 1915-16; but the crippling \nstrains on industry and commerce in 1917, especially from mid-\nsummer, were unmistakable to all who experienced them.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans.214 Lenin's intention was for \nwage-earners to supervise owners and managers. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin. \nBukharin, returning to Russia in May, counselled the inception of \na 'workers' control' which expelled the existing managers and \nreplaced them with a collective board elected by the workforce.219 \nLenin was more cautious. 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. Lenin seldom forgot his \nduties as chief of a political party. Lenin may have been cautious by Bukharin's \nstandards, if not by Milyutin's, and even stood towards the right of \nBolshevik economic thought in 1917; but he still occupied a spot on \nthe extreme left of the spectrum of Russian economic proposals \noutside his party.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy. Not enough is known about the \ndebates behind closed doors to allow us to say why Lenin altered his \nstance; but probably either the Central Committee forced him or he \nindependently took cognisance that nationalisation would not prove \nattractive to the peasants. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. Two hundred and forty-two 'peasant instructions' had \nbeen collated, and Lenin urged that the party accept them as the \nbasis of the Bolshevik party's policy.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation.245 \nLenin enjoyed the discomfiture of his opponents, and was not at all \ndisconcerted by the accusation that he had stolen another party's \npolicy. He wanted power for himself and his party, and he wanted \nthis power to be directed at the eventual attainment of socialism in \nRussia and Europe. \nThis was an engaging and even endearing characteristic; but it also \nshowed a casualness and, for a theoretician who had castigated all \nand sundry for their weaknesses of analysis and anticipation, an \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhypocrisy and irresponsibility. Lenin's self-awareness was not great. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader. The scent of real power grew stronger, and \nLenin's excitement at his opportunity intensified.", "Bolshevik_Leadership_1919": " The decrees of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War must not \nbe treated as an accurate gauge of reality. Nor were Lenin and his colleagues \npusillanimous in the exercise of repression. Merciless struggle, \nmonolithic unity and and the strictest discipline were catch-phrases \nof Bolshevik public life. \nThere can equally be no doubt that the Bolsheviks were violent on a \nmassive scale even if not as comprehensively as was their officially-\nstated intention. After the Eighth Party \nCongress, Lenin and his colleagues informed local Bolshevik bodies \nthat an 'extraordinarily threatening danger' was posed from the east. The White army fled in chaotic fashion and mid-Siberia \nwas returned to Bolshevik rule. Lenin had spent the previous \nmonths calling for the forces of Kolchak to be fought and pursued \n88 \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n89 \nwithout mercy; but he did not want to appear responsible for \nKolchak's summary liquidation. He gave orders that any future official \nexplanation should suggest that local Bolsheviks were responding to a \nlocal emergency. Nor is he likely to have worried that, if the Reds \neven then lost the Civil War or if an anti-Bolshevik crusade from \nabroad succeeded, similar treatment might be meted out to him in \nretaliation; for he knew his deeds had already made him a marked \nman2 It may simply be that he wanted to persuade other White units to \nsurrender of their own volition.4 To the Eastern front political commissars, fighting \nKolchak, Lenin had written on 29 May 1919: 'If we haven't conquered \nthe Urals by the winter, I consider the doom of the Revolution \ninevitable.9 \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nEarlier spats had occurred among Politburo members; but Lenin had \navoided involvement. The principal disputants were Trotski, Zinoviev \nand Stalin. Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. Lenin, with reservations but also with decisiveness, took \nthe side of Stalin and Zinoviev. The Revolutionary-Military Council \nwas relocated to Moscow; and S. Nevertheless Lenin would not go all the way with Stalin. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July. On 3 July, as the Bolshevik Central Committee was having \nits frantic meeting in the capital, Denikin issued his Moscow Directive. \nThe Bolsheviks and their Red Army, almost to their own surprise, had \npulled off victory in the main theatre of conflict over the Russian \nempire. Lenin celebrated enthusiastically. 19 He and the Politburo had \nhad no time to draw breath since 1918. How Lenin evaluated the \ncapacities of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich is unclear. The bulk of the population also lived under \nBolshevik rule. Very well, then: Bolshevik propaganda should be \ndiverted towards attracting their support. But they and Lenin had no illusions \nabout each other. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. There were plenty \nof them, and Lenin's misjudgement about Petrograd was simply the \none he was personally and primarily responsible for. But he had made \nfewer than most of his colleagues; and those, like Kamenev, who \nforesaw difficulties more clearly than he, would never have led the \nBolsheviks to the party's satisfaction. \nGATHERING THE LANDS \nIt had been the ending of the Great War rather than any success \nagainst the Whites that had first brought Lenin and his colleagues back \nto deliberations on the 'national question' in the former Russian \nempire. The \nConstitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (or \nRSFSR) drawn up in summer 1918 was extremely unspecific; and even \ndebate at the Eighth Party Congress had avoided specifying what \nrelations were to be pursued among the various republics. The creation of \nindependent Soviet republics had been initiated by Lenin. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Otherwise, \nLenin added, the troops of the Reds would not be treated as \n'liberators'. In \nthe winter of 1918-1919, Adolfloffe was sent to Belorussia to persuade \nlocal Bolsheviks that the RSFSR's interest would be served by a line of \n'buffer republics' between itself and powerful states to the west. 25 Their \nimmediate re-incorporation into an undisguisedly Moscow-based state \nmight instigate an even more British and French anti-Bolshevik \ncrusade than at present. Lenin kept a rein on policy. Leading local \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n93 \nBolsheviks in each Soviet republic were not easily reconciled to their \nown declarations of independence.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Without Lenin's \nassistance, they could not conquer their own countries. The policy of \nLenin, Stalin and Trotski had therefore to be accepted.28 But the only published elucidation \nwas the Party Congress decision to treat the Ukrainian, Belorussian, \nLithuanian and Latvian Communist Parties as regional party \norganisations subordinate to the authority of the Russian Communist \nParty in Moscow. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia.30 \nEvidently Lenin did not want to be seen as an initiator. The fiction of \nnon-intervention by Moscow in non-Russian affairs had to be \nmaintained. For example, the Politburo on 23 \nApril 1919 resolved to ask the Ukrainian Bolshevik leadership to \nascertain how best 'a fusion of Ukraine with Soviet Russia might be \narranged'. \nFurthermore, the Bolsheviks in command of the other republics were \nnot always sensitive to national traditions - and often they carried \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthrough measures in total defiance of local society.32 For example, the \nUkrainian Bolsheviks had harassed the so-called middle peasantry and \ntried, in places, to impose collective farming by force. Consequently \nLenin may well have judged greater centralisation of authority to be \nless risky than letting the local Bolshevik-led governments enjoy much \nautonomy. Not that Lenin ever needed great encouragement to \ncentralise.33 \nUkrainian Bolshevik consent was also to be sought; and yet, even \nbefore treaty documents were signed, Lenin approved a directive to the \nparty leadership in Kiev stipulating that 'the People's Commissars of \nthe RSFSR should become People's Commissars of the Union with the \nPeople's Commissariats of Ukraine as their regional plenipotenti-\naries'. \nConsultations proceeded with Bolsheviks in the other republics. The Politburo controlled the entire \nparty and, despite occasions of serious disobedience, the Civil War \nwitnessed a strong insistence of authority on local Bolsheviks and \nconsequently on republic governments. In August 1919 Christian \nRakovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian Sovnarkom, was brusquely \nordered by the Politburo to close down several People's Commissariats \nand to dispense with a Ukrainian Council of Defence and Labour.36 A \ncontrast is sometimes drawn between Lenin and Stalin on basic aspects \nof the national question. Lenin liked to finesse the appearance \nof policy to a greater extent than Stalin. Typically he \nwrote an open letter on 28 December 1919 stating that it was up to the \nworkers and peasants of Ukraine to determine 'exactly what federative \nlink' to have with Soviet Russia. But Lenin was disingenuous. It was \nplanned by Stalin's Commissariat as early as 18 March 1918, but the \nbattles with the Whites in the Volga region and the Urals rendered it \nimpracticable for a whole year. 38 \nFurthermore, the Tartars against the expectations of the Bolsheviks \nproved to be aggressively self-assertive. As if this was not enough, the \nexiguous Bolshevik cadres in the Tartar-inhabited lands could not be \ncounted on to support the formation of a Tartar Republic along the \nmodel of Bashkiria.40 \nThe basic problem was that, as the Mensheviks had warned the \nBolsheviks before 1917, the former Russian empire was a quilt of \ninterstitched nationalities. No single ethnic group lived alone in a \nclearly demarcated zone; and, as often as not, the attempt to designate \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch zones aggravated inter-ethnic tensions. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. Mirsaid Sultan \nGaliev, a rare Bolshevik from Tataria, had come to believe in the \nnecessity of a huge Turkic-speaking socialist state being carved out of \nthe Russian empire, larger even than the ill-fated Tartar-Bashkir \nRepublic. He also wanted aspects of Islam to be grafted on Bolshevik \nthought.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. In addition, the non-Bolshevik members of the \nBashrevkom proved even more intractable in 1920 than in 1918-\n1919. Some who rebelled against Sovnarkom were put under arrest \nand, on Stalin's recommendation, transferred to Moscow prisons. Stalin's knowledge of the \nquestion was gaining respect among fellow central party leaders. \nOnly Lenin seriously opposed him. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. Stalin was moving further and further away from pragmatic \ncompromise with nationalist opinion among non-Russians; and Lenin \ncould not be indifferent to the danger this involved: Stalin had \npositioned himself much closer than before to the conventional \nattitudes of the Bolshevik leadership at central and local levels. A \nclash between Lenin and Stalin might be postponed, but not \npermanently avoided.47 \nWAR LEADER \nLenin was one of the few leaders to stay in Moscow throughout the \nCivil War. Just once Lenin took a trip to \nanother Russian city after the capital's transfer to Moscow in February \n1918: this was his sojourn in Petrograd in July 1920 for the start of the \nSecond Congress of the Communist Internationa1.48 Lenin had no \nmetropolitan prejudice. But he had an exceptional inclination towards \ncentralism, and assumed that his presence in Moscow was crucial to the \nsmooth running of the central political machinery. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters.53 As always, he \ntalked to visitors to Moscow who were fellow party members; he also \ncontinued to receive groups of peasants who, as once they had brought \ntheir grievances to Nicholas II, picked out Vladimir Lenin as the new \n'little father'. Lenin \nand his sister Mariya were being driven by chauffeur Gil to the \nSokolniki district on the outskirts of Moscow to visit his wife \nKrupskaya. Lenin was not \ncompletely intimidated. Rather he was astounded, and shouted out to \nthem: 'My name is Lenin. Lenin had further humiliation in store. They sought mercy on the grounds that they had assumed \nthey were robbing someone calling himself Levin rather than Lenin. After all, the Bolshevik \nparty was committed to the eradication of anti-semitism (and, although \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n99 \nthe fact was not bruited, Lenin was anyway part-Jewish by descent). Lenin joked about his surrender of pistol \nand wallet to the gang in terms borrowed from the lexicon of Marxism: \n'Such a compromise was akin to our compromise with the bandits of \nGerman imperialism. Lenin's telegram \nto Trotski ran as follows: 'In connection with the coded telegram from \nthe three commanders of the Eastern front I propose we should \nappoint [S. '59 \nYet his interference was limited mainly to emergencies; he recognised \nthat Trotski, Stalin and other Bolshevik commissars at the fronts had \nto take decisions without automatic detailed consultation with \nMoscow. Lenin was the motor of the political machinery. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms.60 \nLenin habitually chaired Politburo sessions. Lenin's colleagues appear \nto have treated them as reassurance that someone in the Kremlin cared \nabout them and their work. It was in the \ncollegiate deliberations of the People's Commissars that Lenin \nmanaged to put flesh on the bone of Politburo decisions. After \nSverdlov's death the legislative work of the Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets became even more of a \nformality. The Council was an adjunct of Sovnarkom; its chairman was \nLenin. A source of greater irritation was his \npractice of doing things through the Politburo even when there were \nenough Central Committee members currently in Moscow to make a \nquorum; but nothing was done about this until the end of 1920 (when \nPolitburo members were in dispute with each other). His supreme position in Soviet \npolitics was accepted as necessarily deflecting him from such tasks.6s But Lenin was among several \ncentral party colleagues who insisted. Lenin's refusal of \ntitles, awards and celebrations was to some extent a self-regarding \ntactic. Lenin was genuinely devoid of vanity. Lenin was a fellow of simple habits. He went shooting in the forests with leading Bolsheviks. \nYet the little time he spent away from Moscow and political leadership \nwas far from being non-political. His only friends were Bolsheviks. \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNearly all were comrades rather than friends. Such comforts as were available to him from his \nposition as head of government were anyway regarded by Lenin as \nenabling him to concentrate upon the consolidation of the October \nRevolution. \nEXPORT OF REVOLUTION, SIEGE ECONOMY \nThe activities of Lenin and his associates in 1919 demonstrate that, \nafter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the party still adhered to its objective \nof European socialist revolution. Its leader Bela Kun was to \nreveal, indiscreetly, that considerable financial assistance reached him \nin Budapest and that Lenin had been the instigator of its provision.66 \nLenin also wished to supply military assistance to the extent that the \nRed Army was capable.68 He and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership had been \nequally cheered by the communist seizure of power in Munich. It was beginning to look as if the \npredictions made by Lenin in 1917 were coming true.'69 \nAlready, however, the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics \nappeared fragile, and Lenin sensed that the Hungarian comrades were \ntoo reckless for their own good. Lenin defended his \ncolleagues; but the sole counsel he could give was as follows: 'Hold on \nfor all you are worth, and ours shall be the victory.'74 \nLenin was wrong about this: the Hungarian Soviet Republic was \noverthrown by late August and Bela Kun fled to Moscow. Yet Lenin \nwas right in his caution about international relations in the Baltic \nregion. Not only did he and Chicherin aim to avoid giving offence to \nthe Allies; they also strained to minimise the involvement of the \nindependent states in the anti-Bolshevik military operations of the year. The matter came before the Politburo on II September, and \nit took all the pressure that Lenin could muster to secure a decision to \nend the condition of war with Latvia and Lithuania as well as with \nFinland. Lenin's \ndifficulty lay in countering the arguments of the 'native' communist \nleaders of the Baltic region who wanted to keep their respective \ncountries on the agenda of revolutionary expansion. But Lenin pulled \nthe Politburo to his pragmatic viewpoint. 76 Chicherin opposed on the grounds that such a policy \nwould destroy the impression, eagerly cultivated by Soviet diplomacy, \nthat the Russian republic was uninterested in extending socialism to \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nforeign states on the point of a bayonet. Initially he had \nLenin's support.78 But subsequently Lenin agreed with Trotski that \nYudenich should not only be driven back from Petrograd but also be \nsought out and liquidated as a military force. A breach in the wall of \ninternational capitalism, Lenin felt, had been obtained. \nThrough summer 1919 Lenin kept a discreet silence about Allied \nintentions.82 \nJust as he had not highlighted the danger from the Allies in mid-\n1919, so Lenin eschewed any welcome for the lifting of the blockade. Precisely this was said by Lenin in \nan interview with the Christian Science Monitor in September 1919.84 Nevertheless, knowing the unpopularity \nof concessions and being busy with a thousand other duties, Lenin left \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n105 \nit to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade to draw up a detailed \nplan in January.85 The incumbent supreme official was Lev Krasin, \nwho submitted theses on concessions to Sovnarkom under Lenin's \nchairmanship on 20 March 1920.86 \nSo what on earth was Lenin up to. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. Lenin was a stealthy, sinuous politician. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. He emphasised the role to be played by the trade unions as a \ncounterweight to the Bolshevik party. But it was a sign of Lenin's \nconfidence that he refrained from comment on Workers' Oppositionist \nnotions.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.97 Stalin \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n107 \nwent along with Trotski's argumentation and became leader of the \nFirst Labour Army.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise. Consequently, according \nto Lenin, the troops should be retained under military discipline and \ndeployed for economic duties.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. Militarisation of labour, for Lenin, was a regrettable necessity \nand not a policy to glory in. 100 \nLenin and Trotski gave their speeches on the issues without naming \neach other in dispute; the tone was comradely. Grain requisitioning was the cornerstone of \nBolshevik wartime policy: the idea that a private market in wheat and \nrye might return was anathema to the party's leaders. 104 But \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \non this occasion Trotski did not fight his corner. Lenin had won the \ndebate, and Trotski chose to concentrate on his work in the Red Army \nand areas of economic policy where he could get Lenin to compromise \nwith him. Surveys carried out in the mid-1920s were to show \nthat the great majority of the Russian population remained Christian \nby belief; and the Bolsheviks knew that in the peripheral zones of the \nold empire - in the Ukraine, the Baltic region, Georgia and Armenia -\ndevotion to national denominations had been unaltered by the calls of \nthe party to abandon the faith. Most citizens of the Soviet republic ruled \nover by the godless Lenin were believers. Lenin \nappreciated the potential of the Patriarchate as a focus for anti-\nBolshevik opposition. On 20 October \n1918, at the First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers, he argued \nthat excessive zeal in the extirpation of 'religious prejudices' would be \ncounterproductive. 112 At the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919 he suggested that the Bolsheviks would merely give rise to \nfanaticism if offence was given to the beliefs of Christians. Lenin was \ncunning. 114 It is highly improbable that Lenin strongly disapproved. liS Behind \nthe scenes, Lenin blatantly fomented anti-religious violence. A \ntelegram from him to the Penza Soviet Provincial Executive \nCommittee on 9 August 1918 may well be the tip of a bloodstained \niceberg: 'Received your telegram.' 116 \n 110 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Russian Orthodox Church was the one remaining institution \ncapable of rallying most ethnic Russians against Sovnarkom and was \nsingled out for maltreatment by the Cheka. As early as 1903, at \nthe Second Party Congress, Lenin had brought the 'sects' to the party's \nattention. The party should campaign for freedom of \nconscience for all denominations; and Lenin's friend V. 120 Lenin's attentiveness was little greater \ntowards Islam. On 20 November 1917 he and Stalin had co-signed a \nproclamation to 'all labouring Moslems of Russia and the East' which \nguaranteed their freedom to worship; 121 Lenin also warned at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919 against offending Muslim \nsensibilities, and declared that the influence of the mullahs in central \nAsia was even greater than the influence of priests in Russia. But one factor must surely come \ninto the reckoning: this is that the Bolsheviks were already regarded by \nmany Russian Orthodox Christians as a gang of marauding Jews. Almost certainly Lenin did not want to inflame Russian \npopular opinion by siding too openly with religious believers who did \nnot belong to Russia's national church. His decrees of 1917 and the \nSoviet Constitution of July 1918 had promulgated freedom of \nconscience in the Soviet republic. \nIn Lenin's defence it could be said that religious persecution was not \nconfined to the actions of the Reds. 125 \nNor was he the most avid advocate of militant atheism among the \nBolshevik party leaders. Stucka, People's Commissar for Justice, had led a \ngroup which regarded Lenin's position as unnecessarily indulgent to \nreligion in general. 26 Lenin won the day. Even so, he continued to \nhave to protect his position against Bolsheviks with ideas more extreme \nthan his own. 127 \nAll these extenuating factors notwithstanding, Lenin was a harrier of \norganised religion. 129 Thus the \n 112 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRomanov autocracy had needed not only hangmen but also priests to \nmaintain its power. But Lenin had yet to determine \nhow his government should tackle the question of religion. He sensed a particular \npotential menace in the growing attractiveness of the works of the ex-\nBolshevik Aleksandr Bogdanov (whom Lenin since 1908 had charged \nwith the 'heinous' offence of philosophical idealism) to some of his \nclose party co11eagues. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism.' 133 In fact the Bolsheviks had yet again been \nmisinformed. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But he urged that Bolsheviks in the \nmeantime should look on the bright side and get on with 'the peaceful \ntasks of economic construction'. 136 \nNikolai Krestinski followed Lenin with the Central Committee's \norganisational report. 137 Most speakers tacitly concluded \nthat Lenin had placed excessive stress on the need for one-person \nleadership. \nSapronov, the Democratic Centralist: 'In that case I put the question to \ncomrade Lenin: just who is it who will be appointing the C[entral] \nC[ommittee]. Kaganovich pleaded for greater \ncentralist severity did the tirades against Lenin relent.'143 \nKrestinski did not trade insults, 144 1eaving it for Lenin to summarise \nthe case for the Central Committee. 'It is necessary,' declared Lenin in sprawling \nchunks of rhetoric, 'it is necessary to be able to grasp that we are now \nfaced with a practical task, that we must deal with the businesslike task \nof the quickest victory over collapse and ruin with all the forces, with \nthe genuinely revolutionary energy, with the uncompromising zeal with \nwhich our best comrades- the workers and peasants in the Red Army-\ndefeated Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. Rykov, who spoke against one-person leadership, \nnon-electivity and militarisation. 151 But Lenin \nrepaid Trotski's assistance to him. He also quoted from his 1918 \npamphlet The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Smirnov comically asked what would happen to \nTrotski if Lenin took over the government singlehandedly.161 Lenin left things to his \ncolleagues according to the pre-arrangement of the Central Committee. 163 Lenin had less reason to thank his \ncolleagues in the other section. 164 His demarche was a \nreminder that even the more cautious Bolsheviks were yet Bolshe-\nviks: Milyutin overlooked peasant attitudes to nationalisation. But it was an accurate assessment of Lenin's status: the Congress \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreversed the section's choice and took Krestinski's draft theses as the \nbasis of its resolution. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. Lenin was unconcerned that \nleaders closer to Trotski than to him -\nA. Sergeev: each of them preferred Lenin \nto Trotski. \nLenin confidently roused the Congress with his final oration. Finishing his remarks on the \neconomy, Lenin triumphantly proclaimed: 'We shall manage to resolve \nthis problem just as victoriously as we resolved the military problem, \nand shall proceed quickly and firmly to the victory of the Worldwide \nSocialist Soviet Republic.", "Bolshevik_Leadership_1918": " 1 Merciless Retreat \n'THE CURRENT TASKS OF SOVIET POWER' \nLenin was a mercurial mixture as a political leader. The changes made by the Bolsheviks in \ntheir policies after the October Revolution of 1917 were drastic. The \nBolsheviks had also expected to rule a multinational state with the \nsupport of the non-Russian nationalities. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. Public \nopinion had been prepared by Bolshevik propaganda, insofar as such \npropaganda had any effect, for a revolutionary process unmarred by \nproblems. Officers in their thousands \nfrom the demobilised Imperial Army were assembling in southern \nRussia and in mid-Siberia; their objective was the overthrow of Lenin's \nregime. \nSovnarkom, as Lenin's government was known, had survived for a \nnumber of reasons. His Decree on Land gave him credit with the \npeasants, and the Bolsheviks at least did well among the working class \nand garrison soldiers in the Constituent Assembly elections. The \nexhausting conditions of everyday life also worked in the Bolshevik \nparty's favour. Yet the Bolsheviks could not afford to be \ncomplacent. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Every leading Bolshevik appreciated \nthe acuteness of the regime's crisis. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nNo Bolshevik leader was in greater danger than Lenin. About his likely \nfate in the event of the Bolshevik party's overthrow there could be little \ndoubt. Aside from such \nblack propaganda, however, Lenin was undeniably more responsible \nthan any fellow Bolshevik for the actions of his party. But Lenin \nhad to live with the consequences and was in no mood to regret or \napologise. Lenin's political friends were sorely in need of guidance. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Nor was \nhis own Bolshevik party quiescent. Lenin's proposals \ntook the form of a lengthy pamphlet written in the second fortnight of \n1918. Pamphleteering was his most congenial medium of communica-\ntion with fellow Bolsheviks except for speeches to their Congresses. But Lenin was an experienced journalist and \ncould write fast and, when he set his mind to it, forcefully. The result \nwas The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Lenin avoided reference to \nopponents in the Bolshevik party and mentioned the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries only fleetingly. The Brest-Litovsk treaty, that momentous treaty \nwhich had ended hostilities on the Eastern front in the Great War, was \n 4 \nLenin: A Political Life \nscarcely cited. \nHe was astonishingly casual about armed resistance to the \nBolsheviks. Possibly his dismissal of the potential military threat was a \nmere device to fix Bolshevik eyes on the politics and the economy. Lenin seldom failed to bang the war-drum when \nalarmed about the future. Residing in the \nKremlin in Moscw and hearing about events elsewhere in Russia only \nintermittently, Lenin simply blundered.4 The party's priority, according to Lenin, should be the \nintroduction of strict account-keeping and control. Lenin's basic aim was less to create an atmosphere of \nliberation than to get labourers, skilled and unskilled, to raise their \nlevel of discipline and productivity.6 He was blunt: 'The Russian \nworker is a bad worker in comparison with the advanced nations. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished.' \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOPPOSITION AND SURVIVAL \nThe resistance was beginning to cause panic. It would be an \nexaggerated claim that, had Lenin cracked under the strain, the \nBolsheviks would have gone under. 15 The fervid atmosphere seemed to \nleave Lenin cool.' 16 The capacity to close off his mind to distractions was \naccompanied by an ability to impart his confidence to the rest of the \nBolshevik central leadership.17 \nEven the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who wanted to see the treaty \nof Brest-Litovsk torn up, did not envisage Lenin's permanent removal \nfrom the chairmanship of Sovnarkom. Karl Radek, a Bolshevik \nopponent of the treaty, was approached by the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Pavel Proshyan at a meeting of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets with the question: \n'Wouldn't it be simpler to arrest Lenin for a day, declare war on the \nGermans and then wholeheartedly elect comrade Lenin again as \nSovnarkom chairman.' 18 The matter was not just personal (although a \nrecognition of Lenin's exceptional qualities as a leader was involved). The Urals Regional \nCommittee and the Moscow Regional Committee, as well as the \nTaganrog Conference of Bolsheviks fleeing from Ukraine in the path of \nthe German military occupation, were vehemently hostile to Brest-\nLitovsk and all it stood for. 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees. The Moscow \nRegional Committee was their first and most important victim.21 \n Merciless Retreat \n7 \nAt the same time Lenin no more wanted to lose the Left Communists \nthan they him.22 Lenin saw that the Bolsheviks \nwere too few to be able to dispense with a faction's assistance; but the \nwords of the decision reflect also his condescension to the Left \nCommunists as being given to light-headed abstractions in their \nthinking. They were centralisers to an even higher \ndegree than Lenin. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. Bukharin had \nalready produced a pamphlet entitled The Programme of the \nCommunists (Bolsheviks). 23 Despite being schematic and full of \njargon, the writings of this left-wing Bolshevik troika appealed to \nmany, perhaps even most, long-standing party activists. Lenin \nconsequently had reason to fear Bukharin's return to the fold. They were still more utopian and incoherent than Lenin;24 but \nin practice, like him, they tended to support centralist force against \nlocally-established collective endeavours whenever they had to make a \nchoice.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. On 9 May a further discussion took place and Lenin's \namendment was rejected. Lenin kept up the pressure.30 Lenin's blood was up. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. But Bolsheviks of all persuasions hardly \ncared. Lenin and his opponents in his own party \nhad found common cause once more, and were relieved that they could \nwork together again. 31 \n Merciless Retreat \n9 \nNot only Lenin but also his colleagues were recklessly narrowing the \npolitical base of their regime. Bolsheviks were made \nanxious by the rise in working-class antipathy to themselves. The discontent \nwas simply transferred to other arenas: anti-Bolshevik sentiment found \nexpression in the growing popularity of the movement for an Assembly \nof Plenipotentiaries among Petrograd workers. Strikes broke out in \nnorthern Russia, and an improvised demonstration at Kolpino on 9 \nMay was fired upon by troops loyal to the Bolsheviks. The Putilov Works, which in 1917 had \nprominently supported the Bolshevik political advance, came out in \nsympathy with the Kolpino demonstrators. 32 But Lenin was in no \nmood to yield. Lenin was pre-occupied by the diplomatic \nand military crisis rather than rendered cowardly by the prospect of \njustifying his policies to the Central Executive Committee. Five days later, on 14 \nMay, Lenin returned to the political fray and castigated the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with ferocity. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries continued to \nparticipate fitfully in public affairs over the ensuing three years, but \nalways on Bolshevik terms. That Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik Central Committee \nshould have rushed so fast to impose such a dictatorship is evidence of \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir extraordinary confidence that, despite the terrific reverses \nendured by them at home and abroad since October 1917, history \nwas on their side. Lenin was extremely \ndull about anticipating the scale and timing of outbreaks of civil war. He made \nno effort to smooth relations between the Legion and the Bolshevik-led \nsoviets of the towns they passed through along the railway line.39 \nWhere Trotski lurched, Lenin followed. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. Lenin received an appeal for assistance \nfrom the Penza Bolshevik leader Minkin.42 \nEMERGENCY IN MOSCOW \nThe Czechoslovaks had had no intention of overthrowing Sovnarkom; \nbut on arrival in Samara they were besought by the Socialist \nRevolutionaries, whose leaders had fled there after the dissolution of \nthe Constituent Assembly, to fight on behalf of Komuch. Komuch asserted that it had the most legitimate claim to \nrule the country, and called for the overthrow of the Bolshevik party \ndictatorship. A half-day's train \njourney separated them from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and \nLenin. \nUnless a Red Army could quickly and effectively be moved into action, \nthe Bolshevik leadership would be caught in Moscow and overthrown. \nNonetheless it still appeared to the Central Committee under Lenin \nthat political retreat and reconciliation would endanger the regime to a \ngreater extent than pursuit of the existing policies. Lenin also \nrefused to be intimidated by the resumption of assassinations as a tactic \nby the Socialist Revolutionaries. Moscow became unsafe for the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee even though the Czechoslovaks had not yet moved from \nthe river Volga. \nSuch doubts as Lenin entertained he did not express. '43 \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMartov, for once in his life, underestimated Lenin's determination. \nPossibly the Bolshevik leader may have been wondering whether the \nbenefits of the treaty were as great as he had originally supposed; but \nnot for a moment did he deny that the signature of a separate peace \nwith Germany and Austria-Hungary was a better option than any \nconceivable alternative. Lenin \nwaited on events, and did not have to wait long. On 24 June the Central \nCommittee of the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries met secretly \nto approve the assassination of German diplomats in Moscow. The Left Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leaders hoped that this would lead to a rapprochement of their \nparty and the Bolsheviks in the cause of revolutionary war. \nIntimations of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary conspiracy reached the \nears of Felix Dzierzynski, Bolshevik chairman of the Cheka, on 28 \nJune. Yet victory for the Bolsheviks was already guaranteed by \ntheir majority over the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of voting places. Lenin had no \n Merciless Retreat \n13 \nhesitation. Blyumkin's murderous action gave the Bolsheviks a \nchance to behave as if reacting to an outrage rather than merely \npersecuting fellow socialists. Lenin had it in mind to arrest \nand execute a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee. Disposi-\ntions were made for the detention of Left Socialist-Revolutionary \ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets in the Bolshoi Theatre. Lenin was realistically contemptuous about the \npotential strength of the armed resistance to his forces. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. 50 \nLenin acted speedily for two reasons. The sole advantage to \nBerlin in retaining the Bolsheviks in power was their adherence to \nBrest-Litovsk. Without this, Lenin would be useless to the Germans. 51 \nLenin carried out the mission with distaste.'52 On arrival at the embassy, Lenin carried out the necessary \nformalities. \nUntil then they had neither revolted nor intended to break permanently \nwith the Bolsheviks; their strategy of assassination displayed an \ninfantile standard of calculation, but they had genuinely meant no \nharm to the Bolshevik party. To their horror they saw that the \nBolsheviks aimed at their suppression. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \nLenin resumed practical control. Vacietis's \nsupport was crucial in view of the military weakness of the Bolsheviks \nin Moscow; and the deployment of the Red Army to the Volga region \ncramped the possibilities of reinforcement from elsewhere.57 Yet he may also have begun to understand that the \nbalance of forces, ill-trained as most of them were on both sides, might \nsuddenly change to the disadvantage of the Bolsheviks.59 Yet \nTrotski can hardly have been high in Lenin's esteem at the time. The \npreservation of 'Soviet power' depended entirely upon the loyalty and \nefficiency of a Latvian officer who was neither a Bolshevik nor a \nproven military officer. \nFortunately for Lenin, Vacietis completed his task splendidly.61 An uprising of Left Socialist-Revolution-\naries had also been started in Yaroslavl, a town to Moscow's north \neast, on 6 July, but was suppressed a fortnight later. The former \ncoalition partners of the Bolsheviks went down to defeat; almost \nwithout noticing it, Lenin and the core of Bolshevik Central Committee \nmembers had passed over the threshold from a two-party revolutionary \ndictatorship into an outright dictatorship by one party. \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMANOEUVRE, RETREAT, WAIT \nLenin knew that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk depended entirely on the \nGerman government's intentions, and that these in turn were shaped \nby success or failure for German forces on the Western front. \nLenin did not lie supine in the meantime.63 The Bolsheviks deferred to Bertin; their \nforces were pathetically incompetent to resist. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement. Lenin's political survival depended on Allied military \nsuccess in the West at least until such time as the long-expected \nrevolution should break out in Berlin. Every political party in Russia regarded the \nBolsheviks as traitors. \nNot even Lenin wished to give public display of such submissiveness. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism. It appears to \nhave staggered Sokolnikov, who until then had been Lenin's supporter, \nthat the Germans had chosen and been able to rule Ukraine through \nlocal stooges. Lenin's high-risk strategy did not go unperceived \nas such. Lenin was especially keen \nto secure backing from Trotski, who had been on the left side in the \nBrest-Litovsk controversy.79 Trotski and Zinoviev \nbacked Lenin.80 His \nsupport for Lenin disproved this. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were \nrecognised in Berlin as godless and anti-monarchical. But Bolshevism \nwas allowed to stay in power because it represented the sole Russian \nparty which would adhere to the Brest-Litovsk treaty; and, unless the \nRed Army could reassure Berlin about its capacity to resist insurrection \non Russian soil, the Bolshevik party would have been cast down by \n Merciless Retreat \n19 \nLudendorff. On 10 June, \nLenin rebuked the Bolsheviks in Kuban for mounting an attack on \nGerman troops in Taganrog, and similar instructions were issued two \ndays later to Red Army and Bolshevik party personnel on the Southern \nfront: no military engagement with the Germans was permissible. This information was as yet unavailable \nto Lenin. Yet Lenin anyway \nconsidered he had little choice. Consequently Lenin was even willing on 13 \nAugust to risk inviting the Germans, through Chicherin, to bomb \nArkhangelsk on Sovnarkom's behalf. A new era in the Soviet republic's relations with the governments \nand peoples of the rest of the world was heralded. Lenin had misled himself. But \nBrest-Litovsk had at least ensured the sheer survival of the Bolsheviks \nin power. It was an achievement of Lenin's gamble in international \nrelations. \nTHE WRITING OF A CONSTITUTION \nLenin scoffed at constitutionalism in politics. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above. The \nBrest-Litovsk dispute pre-occupied the minds of both the Bolsheviks \nand the Left SRs. Not until 30 March did the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee approve a proposal for the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets to set up a drafting \ncommission.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Sverdlov was commission chairman, and \nStalin was included as the Bolshevik official expert on the question of \nthe nationalities.90 Notable by his absence was Lenin. \nThe federal basis of the forthcoming Constitution had been \nestablished, on Lenin's recommendation, at the Third Congress of \n Merciless Retreat \n21 \nSoviets in January 1918.93 Sovnarkom at present \nruled only Russia- and not all Russia at that.96 The contrast with Lenin was \nimpressive. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress. Even so, Stalin was tossing aside the \nargument that Russians would be politically unwelcome in those parts \nof the Russian Empire unless the Bolshevik party went out of its way to \ndisclaim territorial acquisitiveness.98 Yet Lenin was \nso unexercised by the constitutional question that he did nothing until \nSverdlov's commission reported back to the Central Committee. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. This booklet, which had recently been published but \nhad been written in mid-1917, envisaged a revolutionary order with \nmuch greater scope for popular initiative than Lenin was willing to \ntolerate by 1918. All he could \nsay in reply was: 'Mention has been made here of comrade Lenin. I \nwould permit myself to remark that Lenin, so far as I know - and I \nknow very well -, has said that this project is worthless.' 103 Some \nBolshevik members remained unhappy with his performance. The need \nfor any reference to national issues rankled so much that Pokrovski, a \nBolshevik, preferred Reisner's draft. Lenin and \nStalin in 1917 had taken pains to get the slogan of national self-\ndetermination accepted in the Bolshevik party, and were convinced \nthat its deployment would help the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Lenin began to take an interest from a \ndistance. His main ambition for the Constitution was for it to rouse \nworkers and peasants to support the Bolsheviks. Instead he \nsubstituted a text already accepted at the Third Congress of Soviets, \nnamely 'The Declaration of Rights of the Labouring and Exploited \nPeople' submitted by Lenin to the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.105 \nSverdlov, understandably miffed, behaved like a disciplined \nBolshevik and induced the commission to comply on 17 June. 106 The \nBolshevik Central Committee, looking at the result nine days later, was \nunimpressed. Lenin even threatened to remove the Constitution from \nthe agenda of the forthcoming Congress of Soviets. 107 Sverdlov, who \nhad many other duties to fulfil at the same time, felt unappreciated by \nhis party leader. 109 Its final draft was \nperused by the Central Committee, in the presence of Lenin and \nTrotski, on 3 July. A last effort at polishing the style, but not the contents, was \nentrusted to Yuri Steklov; and it was Steklov, a leading ex-Menshevik \nwriter and editor, who was instructed to present the draft Constitution \nto the Fifth Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918. Nevertheless the \nBolshevik Central Committee did not introduce further amendments \nafter being released from the need to conciliate the party's coalition \npartners. \nAlready there was more flim-flam than substance in the Bolshevik \nparty's commitment to creating a federation. But the Bolshevik party leadership cynically hoped to \nattract the support of non-Russian peoples by showing off federalism \nas a slogan. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power. Yet \nLenin did not intend to agitate himself and his comrades over a \nquestion of Marxism which since 1917 had been dear to him. 118 The same section implicitly \ncleared the ground for the Bolsheviks to outlaw any political parties, \norganisations or newspapers. Vladimir Lenin would only \nbother with constitutional trifles when his current political purposes \nwere threatened. Trotski, Dzierzynski and Lenin \nconfronted a near-disastrous military situation. \nThe Bolshevik leaders had also seen the uses of the prisoners-of-war \ntaken by Russian armies in 1914-1917, especially those from the lands \nof the Hapsburg monarchy (and the Constitution itself had been \nformulated so as to grant citizenship to all foreigners working in Russia \nor fighting in the Red Army). Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. 126 \nTrotski's efforts were intensified when the Czechoslovak Legion, on \nentering into Samara, put itself at the disposal of the Komuch \ngovernment of Socialist Revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the \nBolsheviks in Moscow. \nBonch-Bruevich (who, despite his anti-socialist convictions, was \nbrother to Lenin's personal assistant Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich). Sviyazhsk was \nheld and the Reds marched upon Kazan. Lenin stayed in Moscow in \nAugust. The \nfollowing note was dispatched to Trotski from Lenin: 'I'm sure that the \nsuppression of the Czechs and White Guards, as well as the \nbloodsucking kulaks who support them, will be a model of \nmercilessness. This \nprovoked outrage in the Bolshevik party. Rozengolts headed the court martial, was unrepentant \nand sought Lenin's support on 23 October. Its commander was Mikhail Tukhachevski. This was Lenin's birthplace. Lenin failed to understand the \ngeographical limitations of the Red victory. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards. \nLenin was not the sole Bolshevik to exult, and Pravda editorials were \nunderstandably keen to emphasise the successes in battle. Yet the \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncentral party leaders, both in the Kremlin and by the Volga, had little \nknowledge about other Russian forces being formed to attack the \nReds. Denikin, after the death of Lavr Kornilov in action in \nApril 1918, had taken over the armed units of anti-Bolshevism in \nsouthern Russia. From three sides of the compass \nthere was a threat to the existence of the Bolshevik party and the Soviet \ngovernment. Yet Lenin referred to none of them in his telegrams in \n1918.", "Participate_1905": " On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region.", "Bolshevik_Central_Committee_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. The Central Committee met on \n13-li:,July, in the absence of Lenin and Zinoviev (as well as the \nimprisoned Kamenev), 5 to consider strategy. Representatives of the \nparty's localleaderships of Moscow and Petrograd as well as Central \nBureau of the Military Organisation also attended. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.', according to Ordzhoni-\nkidze's later account, Lenin let it be known that the factory-\nworkshop c9mmittees could provide the institutional base for the \nforthcoming socialist administration.6 Even the April Party Confer-\nence had given no absolute commitment to rule by soviets;7 and in \nThe State and Revolution, written in the months after the July Days, \nLenin had barely mentioned the soviets. 8 Even so, the Central \nCommittee was aghast. Only Sverdlov fully accepted Lenin's view-\npoint immediately after the July Days.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. In addition, the party had \ninvested its energies in persuading workers that 'soviet power' was \nthe noblest objective; and the practical difficulties of justifying \nLenin's proposed change of slogans, when Bolshevik activists spoke \nat open mass meetings, would be considerable. The Central \nCommittee meeting rejected Lenin's invocation by ten votes out of \nfifteen. 10 \nLenin wrote a short article, 'On Slogans', in reply and condemned \nthe Central Committee for what he saw as a lack of tactical \nflexibility.\" 'On Slogans' was published by the Kronstadt \nBolsheviks, and reached a number of activists in the provinces. 12 \nLenin's efforts did not go unrewarded; and a shift towards his stance \nhad in any case been occurring in the Central Committee even before \n The Fire Next Time \n203 \n'On Slogans' became widely known. Stalin was nominated to speak \non the Central Committee's behalf at the Second City Party \nConference in Petrograd on 16 July. 16 \nYet Lenin's fortunes were not as bad as they seemed. Perhaps this clarifica-\ntion (or modification, if Ordzhonikidze's statement in his memoirs \nabout the factory-workshop committees is to be believed)18 nudged \nStalin and the Central Committee majority towards accepting that \nLenin's hostility to the 'All Power to the Soviets. Lenin's Bolshevik critics may also \nhave been reassured to note that he acknowledged that an immediate \ninsurrection was impracticable.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets. On 26 July 1917, the 157 voting and 107 non-voting \ndelegates convened.20 Lenin and Zinoviev could not risk the journey; \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Trotski, Lunacharski and Kamenev were in prison.21 \nThe decree was not unwelcome to Lenin inasmuch as it dissuaded \nBolshevik critics from continuing to demand that he should deliver \nhimself up to the authorities.23 There is a strong \npossibility that the Central Committee's motion on the political \nsituation, as presented to the Congress by Stalin, was based on a \ndraft handed over by Lenin. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. A troika of leaders guided \nthe debates at the Congress: Sverdlov, Stalin and Bukharin. The next day, 27 July, Stalin delivered the Central \nCommittee's report on its activities since the April Conference. His \nmain aim was to show that the Bolshevik leadership had not \nprovoked the clashes on the streets of the capital in early July. But the Moscow-based \nCentral Committee member V. Vasilev \ncomplained that the party's agrarian policy was still so vague that the \nBolsheviks were failing to win support among peasants. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. In such a \ncontingency, according to Bukharin, the Bolsheviks would have to \nfight a defensive revolutionary war against the Germans. 35 \nStalin intervened to defend the Central Committee against more \nbasic opposition. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed.

(above) Lenin goes for a stroll in Moscow, Spring 1918. The Central Committee, for all its con-\nfidence, had not come properly prepared to the Congress. '52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential. The Central Committee, as Stalin and Milyutin had intimated, had \nfor months been using slogans which simply urged the transfer of the \nland to the peasantry.61 Here \nLenin would probably have sympathised with Preobrazhenski's basic \npoint. \nThe Congress elected a Central Committee. Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. All \nthese four were in hiding or in prison: Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and \nTrotski. Trotski, who had only recently become a \nBolshevik, now joined the central party leadership. Yet the most vital \nchange in the Central Committee's composition went unnoticed at \nthe time. The Bolshevik right, which had been strongly represented in \nthe central party body after the Seventh Conference in April, had lost \nground. As Lenin put his thoughts in order for a seizure \nof power and for a programme of social and economic reforms, he \ncould look to a more receptive set of colleagues than he had \npossessed since entering the politics of Russian Marxism. \nKERENSKI AND KORNILOV \nDespite the dispute over slogans, no Bolshevik at the Congress gave \nthe impression of expecting to take power in the immediate future. If \nLenin had been there, things might have been different. For Lenin, this proved conclusively that \nthe Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were collaborating \nwith the forces of counter-revolution.66 \nKerenski, as Lenin continually asserted, relied on military support \nto reimpose the cabinet's will in Petrograd. The Conference was attended by an array of public \ngroups: the cabinet; the political parties; the army high command; \ndeputies of the pre-revolutionary Dumas; the soviets, trade unions \nand co-operatives. The sole major omission from the list of \nparticipants was the Bolshevik party. The fate \nof both the cabinet and the soviets hung in the balance.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. A counter-\nrevolutionary mutiny had restored them to free activity in the \ncapital; the sole major Bolshevik who could not afford to appear \nin the open was Lenin.70 \nLenin, analysing the events as reported in the press, swung between \ninterpretations. Lenin's claim that \nMilyukov colluded with the Kornilov revolt has not been corro-\nborated; 72 but it was widely believed that he expected a coup and \nwould give it his approval. Accordingly, Kerenski badly \n11eeded to mend his fences with the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries in the soviets. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 74 \nIt was an intriguing phase in Lenin's career. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. By 12 September \nhe was writing 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power' and demanded an \nimmediate uprising; and, on 14 September, he repeated this call in \n'Marxism and Insurrection';77 both documents were letters addressed \nto the Central Committee. His \nfirst justification was that both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets \nhad acquired Bolshevik working majorities earlier in the month. The Central Committee, in any \ncase, did not receive them until 15 September.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.82 Kamenev and Trotski, who had both been released \nfrom prison, were nominated as Bolshevik spokesmen and required \nto demand the removal of Kerenski and the installation of a \ngovernment composed entirely of socialists.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Trotski, too, was \nmoving towards such a standpoint and earned a plaudit from Lenin \nfor the taunts he flung at the non-Bolshevik socialists at the \nDemocratic Conference: 'Bravo, comrade Trotski.'84 But even \nTrotski believed that insurrection could not immediately be under-\ntaken, and the Central Committee as a whole resisted Lenin's \nproposal. It \nwas as if Lenin had been the boss of a gang intent on robbing a bank \nwho had incautiously confided his intentions to paper - his fellow \ngang-members wished to destroy the incriminating evidence.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise. 86 Thus the Central Committee deftly used the prestige \nand authority of 'Lenin' to oppose Lenin. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Through the first weeks of October there was a series of \nvictories for the Bolsheviks in elections to the various mass \norganisations. Soviets, trade unions and factory-workshop commit-\ntees were falling into their control.92 \nTo be sure, these pro-Bolshevik voters were not wholly conscious \nof the nature of Bolshevism; and, outside Russia and the Russian-\ndominated cities in the peripheral regions of the old empire, direct \nsupport for the party was minuscule. Lenin's affirmation that 'the \nmajority of the people' favoured the Bolsheviks lacked cogency. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. Hostility to the \nKerenski cabinet was focused on trade unions and factory-workshop \ncommittees (as well as suburb soviets). \nLenin's insistence that time was not on the side of the Bolshevik \nparty is therefore hard to explain. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. As Lenin pointed out, Marxism's co-founders \nbelieved that every society since the ending of ancient communism \nhad been divided into rival classes. Lenin retailed the characteristics approved by Marx. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. 106 By \nany standard this was hyper-confidence; the return to Russia in 1917 \nhad reinforced his sanguine earlier hopes as articulated in 'Marxism \non the State'. But Lenin was writing for \nMarxists, who needed no persuasion on such issues.115 On the other hand, Lenin recognised that \nAnton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Radek had convinc-\n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \ningly exposed Kautsky's 'passive radicalism' before the war.118 This was a reference to the absence of a description of the \n'dictatorship of the proletariat' in general and the soviets in \nparticular.'2\u00b0 Non-Bolsheviks felt no such \ninhibition. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. 133 \nHis non-Bolshevik critics, however, did not limit themselves to \nMarxology. Starting from Lenin's \nassumption that the proletariat would constitute the immense \nmajority in a society undergoing a socialist revolution, he asked \nwhat there would be to fear from allowing the supposedly tiny \nmiddle-class minority to continue to vote (especially if Lenin was \nsincere in saying that such a revolution was inconceivable unless \nmass popular support already existed). Moreover, Lenin's \ntwo antagonists did not share the unargued premise of his book that \neach class would gravitate permanently towards support for a single \nparty. The State and Revolution did not mention parties at all; and \nKautsky and Martov were introducing data from 1918, when a one-\nparty state became an enduring phenomenon in Russia. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Lenin failed, for \nexample, to explain how the local soviets would interact with central \nsoviet organs after the revolution. \nIt is not sensible to assume, as Lenin did, that administrators can \nbe prevented from forming themselves into a corporate group (or \ninto groups) simply by insisting on electivity, on the right of instant \nrecall and on payment at a worker's rate. Kautsky put it in a nutshell when he retortc;d to Lenin that \nclasses can rule but cannot govern; and that mass participatory \nqemocracy is utopian. Yet what \nwas the relationship between such theory and subsequent Russian \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhistory. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Lenin's offering was a strange \nconcoction. All therefore knew of Lenin's \nintentions with the utmost clarity. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. \nIn addition, all those references occurred in the carefully-composed \nprose of Bolshevik newspaper articles and pamphlets. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Yet the result was that the great mass of workers and \npeasants outside the Bolshevik party can scarcely have known about \nhis full range of plans. This can hardly have been fortuitous; Lenin \ncannot have wanted to upset popular sensibilities unnecessarily, and \nthe virtues of dictatorship would not automatically have commended \nthemselves to the Russian working class. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. And so, whereas the general population - probably \nincluding most rank-and-file Bolsheviks- was unaware of his fiercer \nintentions, careful and regular readers should have picked up the \nmessage. 166 \nLenin, indeed, did not stop short of anticipating the use of 'terror' \nin Russia. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Lenin wanted the \nlaw changed so that 'the exploiters (i. For most of the year, however, he preferred to avoid the \ntopic altogether or to concentrate on what he described as the terror \nbeing perpetrated against the Bolsheviks by the Provisional Govern-\nment. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. \nNor was Lenin's willingness to ignore the formally-registered will \nof the majority confined to his ideas about the Assembly: he was no \nmore solicitous as regards the mass organisations. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. He omitted to \nsay what he would do if this vanguard were to turn against the \nBolsheviks and favour other parties; he had developed no ideas of \nmulti-party competition. \nNATIONALITY PROJECTS \nLenin beat the drum about the struggle for political revolution, \nsummoning workers, peasants and soldiers to overthrow the Provi-\nsional Government; but the rhythms of the national question were \nnot forgotten by him. The Provisional Government \nand its Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary supporters were \nfearful lest the Bolsheviks should take advantage of its difficulties \n The Fire Next Time \n229 \nwith some of the non-Russian nationalities. Such conflict \nwas grist in Lenin's mill, and after the Seventh Bolshevik Party \nConference he continued to demand that all nations in the old \nRussian empire should be accorded the right of secession. 182 The \nfact that neither Finns nor Ukrainians were currently striving for \ncomplete independence bolstered Lenin's case against his party's left \nwing, that his talk of the right of secession was a danger to the \nformation of a large socialist state in the old Russian empire. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. But \naccount should also be taken that, in terms of ideas, Lenin's \nproposed solution of the national question within a unitary state \nhad much in common with Semkovski's. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. 196 \nAnd yet we should be wary of assuming that even Lenin made \nnational self-determination into a prominently visible plank in his \nplatform. Leading Bolsheviks privately asked him to \nclarify his policy; but he argued that it was more advisable to limit \nthe party's pronouncements to a simple 'declaration of principles' \n(and even then he published this prevaricatory remark not in a mass-\ncirculation newspaper or at an open mass meeting but in the low-\ncirculation 'thick journal' Enlightenment, which was read mainly by \nBolshevik intellectuals).201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917.202 \nLenin probably considered the matter as being less immediately \ncritical than he had earlier imagined. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. Lenin \ndid precisely that. All Bolsheviks saw that the \neconomy's rapid deterioration was a crucial issue in the struggle \namong the political parties, and Lenin was his party's major \neconomic spokesman. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint. His \n The Fire Next Time \n233 \nwritings contrasted with those of Bolshevik economists such as V.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans. Lenin urged the idea's dissemination and implementa-\ntion across the country and throughout all major industrial \nsyndicates and banking institutions. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin.219 \nLenin was more cautious. 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. Lenin seldom forgot his \nduties as chief of a political party. 224 \n The Fire Next Time \n235 \nOther proposals put forward by Lenin included progressive \ntaxation on incomes and property; compulsory publication of \nshareholdings of over 5000 roubles; universal labour duty, which \nwould mean that those who did not work would not eat either. Lenin may have been cautious by Bukharin's \nstandards, if not by Milyutin's, and even stood towards the right of \nBolshevik economic thought in 1917; but he still occupied a spot on \nthe extreme left of the spectrum of Russian economic proposals \noutside his party. \nFurthermore, there was no originality in Lenin's points about \ndemilitarisation. 231 \nAs regards the land question, Lenin for months added little to \nwhat he had said at the Seventh Party Conference in April.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy. Not enough is known about the \ndebates behind closed doors to allow us to say why Lenin altered his \nstance; but probably either the Central Committee forced him or he \nindependently took cognisance that nationalisation would not prove \nattractive to the peasants. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. Two hundred and forty-two 'peasant instructions' had \nbeen collated, and Lenin urged that the party accept them as the \nbasis of the Bolshevik party's policy.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation.245 \nLenin enjoyed the discomfiture of his opponents, and was not at all \ndisconcerted by the accusation that he had stolen another party's \npolicy. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader. \nRussia and its subject regions in 1917 experienced myriads of further \nrevolutions after the fall of the Romanov dynasty, in cities, in the \narmed forces, and in the villages. Consequently, the Bolshevik Central Committee, with \nmuch skill and not a little luck, linked its political revolution in \nPetrograd to the revolutions elsewhere. Yet the Bolshevik Central Committee appreciated \nthat, in the disintegrated and localised condition of politics at the \ntime, the Petrograd seizure remained as yet a local revolution. 'Soviet power' under the Bolshevik aegis had to be \ndisseminated across the country. This undertaking would put the \nstrategy of Lenin to its greatest test. \nIn those first weeks it was unclear whether the Bolshevik-led \nrevolution in Petrograd would prove adequate to guide and \ndominate the others. Nor was it even settled that Lenin and Trotski \n272 \n The View from Petrograd \n273 \nwould succeed in imposing their own particular vision on their \nCentral Committee colleagues. Russian politics were in \na state of flux. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. \nAnd yet both Lenin and Trotski had returned from emigration, \nand their activity in late October gave them a directing influence over \nthe design of the government and its policies which emerged from the \nuprising in Petrograd. With an impudent astuteness, which has been \nlargely overlooked by historians, Lenin had succeeded in persuading \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee to steer a course towards estab-\nlishing a government without debating the same government's \npersonal composition. In reality, neither Lenin nor Trotski had the \nslightest intention of sharing power with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. The title of Lenin's letter to the Central \nCommittee, 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power', gave an enormous \nhint about his aims; and his endless criticism and ridiculing of the \nMensheviks as being a 'petit-bourgeois party' in pursuit of 'social-\nchauvinism' was scarcely an attitude conducive to co-operation with \nthem. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out. 2 \nEven so, it is mysterious why so many leading Bolsheviks stayed \nblissfully unable to recognise the extent of Lenin's intransigence.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. \nLenin found it hard enough to keep his own Bolsheviks united in the \nwinter of 1917-18, and the dispute over the signature of a separate \npeace in March 1918 was to come near to breaking up his party. He had also acquired a co-leader in the \nperson of Trotski who had the determination to strengthen his case \nin the Bolshevik Central Committee. Nevertheless, Lenin and Trotski had to face certain \nunpleasant realities. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. Out of 366 \nsoviets and army committees represented at the Second Congress of \nSoviets, according to an incomplete but believable questionnaire, 255 \nhad sent delegates to Petrograd on this basis; and no delegate had \nbeen dispatched with a mandate to seek the extrusion of non-\nBolsheviks from the new government. 5 \nThe exodus of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from \nthe Congress had eased Lenin's position by permitting the claim that \nthey had implicitly repudiated the objective of a general socialist \ncoalition. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. Lenin's tactics had to be those of a spoiler; he could not \ncountermand the inter-party discussions. In addition, it was not yet \nclear that the efforts of ex-premier Kerenski and General Krasnov to \neject the Bolsheviks from power would prove fruitless. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. Worse \nstill for Lenin was the announcement from the All-Russian Executive \nCommittee of the Railwaymen's Union (Vikzhel) that, unless the \nBolsheviks agreed to negotiations with other socialists, a rail strike \nwould commence on 29 October. This encouraged the Menshevik \nInternationalists and leftists in the Jewish Bund to canvass more \nstrongly in their parties for the inception of talks designed to produce \na compromise with the Bolsheviks and an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment.6 The Bolshevik Central Committee convened on 29 \nOctober. Lenin and Trotski did not attend, and their absence remains \nunexplained. They had duties in Sovnarkom; but this was also true of \nothers who none the less attended the Central Committee on that \noccasion. 7 Perhaps Lenin and Trotski were engaged in arrangements \nfor the defence of the capital against the anticipated return of \nKerenski in full force. But it is also possible that neither Lenin nor \nTrotski yet wanted to be seen as obvious road blocks in the way of \ninter-socialist harmony; or that they had already determined on \ncoalition talks as a delaying tactic until such time as the Bolsheviks \nwere in a stronger position. Kamenev was present at the \nBolshevik Central Committee session on 29 October; and he and \nG. 10 \nBy then Lenin was feeling less constrained. 11 Lenin could also complain that Kamenev as a negotiator \nhad vastly exceeded his remit from the Central Committee, especially \nwhen ignoring the injunction that any coalition should be subject \nexclusively to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the \nCongress of Soviets. 12 Kamenev had conceded that not only soviets \n 276 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbut also city councils and trade unions, including the Menshevik-led \nrailwaymen, should control the government. 13 Trotski resumed the \npolitical offensive in the Bolshevik Central Committee on I \nNovember, opposing the exclusion of Lenin from any coalition. The Bolsheviks, he exclaimed, had not made a \nrevolution merely to negotiate it away. The Central Committee, siding with Lenin, \ncalled for talks to be resumed, but for Bolshevik representatives to \ndeliver the ultimatum that the other parties accept the Bolshevik \nparty line on peace, land, workers' control, food supplies and the \nstruggle with Kaledin and Kerenski. The Decree on the Press led to raids on non-Bolshevik \nnewspapers such as the liberal-owned Rech and even Den, which \nwas run by the right-wing Menshevik (and one-time collaborator of \nLenin's) A. The Mensheviks, under Martov's influence, \ndemanded on 2 November the liberation of all political prisoners \nalong with an end to military actions and to what they referred to as \nthe Bolshevik 'terror'. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. \nThe next day, Lenin, while chairing Sovnarkom, announced his total \nopposition to the Vikzhel negotiations. Bolshevik power in Moscow \n The View from Petrograd \n277 \nhad been secured; Vikzhel's authority over its own railwaymen was \nsuccessfully challenged by the creation of a new union under \nBolshevik direction; and food supplies were at last reaching central \nRussia from the Volga.20 The necessity of further pretence, in the \neyes of Lenin and Trotski, had evaporated. Lenin drew up an ultimatum: either they obtained the \nparty's approval to form a coalition government, and Lenin would \nfeel free to campaign against such a government; or else Lenin would \nobtain the party's sanction and the opposition itself would campaign \nagainst Sovnarkom.21 \nNo one with the merest acquaintance with Bolshevik history could \nthink that Lenin was bluffing; he seemed to live by the motto: 'If in \ndoubt, split. An \nalready isolated Bolshevik government was getting ready to isolate \nitself further from several of the most prominent Bolshevik leaders. \nKamenev thought that Lenin could not hold out for ever, however \nhard he tried; and Kamenev and his four colleagues resigned their \nplaces in the Central Committee on 4 November.22 Sovnarkom, too, \nwas affected: Nogin, Rykov and Milyutin simultaneously gave up \ntheir places in the Council of People's Commissars.Z3 Kamenev \nwithdrew from the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the \nSecond Congress of Soviets. In total, five out of fifteen People's \nCommissars refused to continue to work in Sovnarkom because of \nopposition to Lenin's and Trotski's intransigence. And there were others \nlike Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, People's Commissar for Labour, who \nagreed not to leave their posts but made public their disgust with the \nrole of Lenin and Trotski in the collapse of coalition talks. 25 Lenin was not so abrasive in public. The Council of \nPeople's Commissars aspired to rule a country with a majority of \npeasants, and it was vital to reassure the peasantry that Bolshevik \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintentions were pure. Mariya Spiridonova and the other Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries could not be treated dismissively, even \nthough they had refused to join the Soviet government at the \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies continued to attend the sessions of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, badgering the \nCouncil of People's Commissars with criticisms of its officials' \nconduct. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. Left Socialist Revolutionaries tended to lay a \nlesser blame on the Bolsheviks than on the anti-Bolsheviks for the \nbreakdown of talks. They formed their own separate party in \nNovember 1917 and openly opposed Chernov at the Second All-\nRussian Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. With this mandate from peasant Russia in their \npockets, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries felt able to re-enter \nnegotiations with the Bolsheviks. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. 30 \nTHE SPREAD OF SOVIET POWER \nLenin's energies were large but not infinite. They were consumed by \nthe problems of setting up Sovnarkom; of brow-beating his party's \nCentral Committee; of cajoling the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ninto office; of overseeing the disposition of military and political \nforces in Petrograd to ensure the final removal of Kerenski and his \ndiminishing band of supporters; of writing and elaborating the \nlegislation which poured forth from the government's chaotic offices \nin the Smolny Institute. \nHowever, in November 1917 he had no choice but to entrust \nprovincial contacts to Yakov Sverdlov. Lenin's disrespect for him \nhad long disappeared. Sverdlov was a brilliant and hard-working \norganiser (even though he suffered even more direly from an inability \nto delegate to others);31 and, as leader of the Central Committee \nSecretariat and chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets, he sent off telegrams in all \ndirections.32 Lenin, Trotski \nand Sverdlov knew that they barely had the capital under control, \nand that Kerenski's defeat might merely be the prelude to a grimmer \ncivil war. The workers, soldiers and peasants had nothing to fear \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nexcept fear itself: the lower social orders of Russia, he declared, had \nto make their own :evolution. Violent incidents recurred in the capital; and \nadministrative confusion abounded as the new structures of author-\nity were constructed and challenged, sometimes by the Bolsheviks \nthemselves. While being warm \nand inspiring in face-to-face meetings in the Institute, Lenin \ncontinued to write the austere prose of the theorist of socialist \nrevolution. Asked for advice and assistance by the Berdyansk \nBolshevik Committee, he responded: 'You understand, comrade, \nthat it is difficult to give you instructions any more concrete than \n\"All Power To The Soviets\". '35 Local Bolsheviks \nwere simply implored to make their own political arrangements and \nkeep an eye on the central party newspaper for general guidance. The \nCentral Committee was acting in accordance with the stated \nBolshevik philosophy of a dual revolution from above and from \nbelow; but it was equally a reflection of practical possibilities. And \nleast of all did Lenin, the father of Bolshevik centralism, believe in \nprinciple in non-intervention in local affairs. Moscow \nwas a case in point. Not only Moscow but also the town of Vladimir and the \nDonbass region were discussed, but the topics related to nationalisa-\ntion and financial assignations rather than to detailed political \n The View from Petrograd \n281 \nguidance and military support; and it had been local Bolshevik and \nsoviet organs which had put them on to the agenda. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. The transfer of authority was in \nany case easier in most other cities and towns of central Russia than \nin Moscow.38 Urban soviets in the region either were already under \nBolshevik influence or else had a large and growing contingent of \nBolshevik deputies. Some \nsoviets had for months been in the hands of socialists seeking the \nProvisional Government's overthrow. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. In \nTambov it took some days of violence before the transfer of power \nwas effected, but in Nizhni Novgorod, there was little armed \nconflict;41 and the soldiers in the Kazan garrison were so pro-\nBolshevik that other groups in the population offered no resis-\ntance. In Simbirsk, the native town of Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-\nLenin, fighting broke out but the rapid victory of the pro-Bolshevik \nforces was never in serious doubt. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918.42 \nLenin, Sverdlov and the various leaders of the Military-Revolu-\ntionary Committee were jubilant, but they could still not observe the \nmarch at first hand; and the reports received by them were frequently \ndelayed and inaccurate. This concern to rouse the local soviets, \ntrade unions and factory-workshop committees to revolutionary \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \naction helps to explain why Lenin, a trained jurist, was vague to the \npoint of remissness in framing the legislation.44 \nLenin was accustomed to explaining party policies in greater detail \nthrough the Bolshevik press, but this was no longer physically \npossible for an overworked politician. He published just one brief \nletter in the central party newspaper in November and December \n1917.45 Visits from provincial Bolsheviks were another channel of \ncontact, but neither Lenin nor his visitors could expend many hours \nin verbal exchanges. Sovnarkom's chairman is recorded as having \nreceived a few dozen visitations from outside Petrograd in November \nand December 1917. A \nlarge influx of party activists from the provinces could only have \nmeant that the Bolsheviks were being forced to flee. And, when \nreportage on local developments reached Petrograd (and it must be \nborne in mind that Sverdlov was meeting more people),47 Sovnarkom \nand the Bolshevik Central Committee were confirmed in their \noptimism. He \nknew that, unless the villages sided with or at least failed to oppose \nthe Bolsheviks, all the political progress in the towns might be \nreversed. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. Despite Bolshevik fears, there was a widespread \ndistaste in the officer corps at all levels for intervening in politics. And yet the chances of \nmobilising regiments against the Bolsheviks were as slim as in the \nnorth. Lenin lent his support in the \nSmolny Institute, listening to peasant complaints and encouraging \nthem to push forward with revolutionary measures. 5\u00b0 But the process \nalso had its own dynamic; peasant soviets were increasingly being set \nup in Russia in late 1917.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. Lenin had made his name as an economist in the 1890s \nby trying to demonstrate that the communal arrangements of the \nRussian peasantry were a vehicle of rural capitalism. \nSECESSION AND FEDERATION \nThe Bolsheviks could not afford to be satisfied with their successes in \nthe Russian heartland, and aspired to spreading 'soviet power' to the \nnon-Russian segments of the old empire; and Lenin was especially \nkeen to embark upon a process of what we nowadays would call 'de-\ncolonisation'. Yet Lenin, unlike the members of \nBritish and French cabinets in the 1950s, did not expect the result to \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbe a large number of new nation-states. Stalin had been asked \nby the Central Committee on 21 October to produce 'theses' on the \nnational question for submission to the Congress of Soviets, 53 but, \ndistracted by his other commitments, Stalin failed to supply these. The appeal issued to \n'workers, soldiers and peasants' from the Second Congress of Soviets \non 25 October offered a guarantee of 'the authentic right of self-\ndetermination to all nations inhabiting Russia'. In the meantime, on 2 \nNovember, a Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia \nwas accepted by Sovnarkom and issued next day under the signature \nof Stalin and Lenin; it called for 'a voluntary and honourable union of \nthe peoples of Russia', abolishing all previous national privileges and \nother discriminations and confirming the right of each nation to \nsecession. 56 \nLenin and Stalin remained allies on the national question; and, \nsince principal opponents such as Bukharin and Pyatakov were \noutside Petrograd (in Moscow and Kiev), and others such as \nDzierzynski were busy in the Military-Revolutionary Committee, \nthey pushed forward with the official policy as formulated by the \nApril Party Conference. Much heat had disappeared from intra-\nBolshevik discussions about the non-Russian nationalities by \nsummer 1917,57 and Lenin acted with a stealthy purposiveness. Lenin's letters to Finnish social-democrats before the \nOctober Revolution reveal how badly he misjudged the socialists of \nFinland even though he had spent the summer among them. Offers of direct military assistance from \nthe Bolshevik commanders of the Russian naval garrisons in Finland \ndid not dispel Wiik's caution. and his colleagues organised a \ngeneral strike in Finland's cities; but they resisted the Bolshevik plea \nto make a revolution because they neither wanted civil war nor were \nconvinced that the Soviet government would long survive in \nRussia. The \nBolsheviks made clear that they would grant independence even to \nSvinhufvud's cabinet. At last, on 18 December 1917, a bemused official \ndelegation from Helsinki to Petrograd obtained on request a \ndocument confirming the secession of Finland from ties of state \nwith Russia. Nevertheless, those \nBolsheviks who had argued against Lenin's line on secession were \nbuoyed up by the fiasco. And yet this also \nmade it easier for the Bolshevik negotiators to gain support \nthroughout the party for the tactic of embarrassing the German \nand Austrian delegations at the peace talks in Brest-Litovsk by \naffirming the need for all peoples to be accorded the right of national \nself-determination. Lenin and \nStalin continued to goad the Finnish social-democrats into a seizure \nof power after December. They began carefully, relying both \non the attractiveness of their Decrees on Peace and on Land, and on \nthe ability of Ukrainian Bolsheviks to seize power for the soviets in \nKiev, Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav. No Bolshevik leader yet approved \nthe principles of federalism. 66 \nThe Bolsheviks in Kiev avoided a clash with the Rada, but \nprepared for the forthcoming Congress of Soviets in the Ukraine. \nBut the Rada steadfastly opposed Sovnarkom and linked up with the \nanti-Bolshevik force among the Don Cossacks. A clash in Kiev was \ninevitable, especially after the arrest of Bolshevik leaders in Kiev in \nlate November. A \ndifficulty for the Bolsheviks was that the Ukrainian Congress of \nSoviets in Kiev found them in a minority. 69 The Bolsheviks \nadjourned to Kharkov, held their own rival Congress of Soviets \nand - guided now by their left-wing leaders- moved to seize power in \nall major cities. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance.71 The Ukrainian Bolshevik leftists, \nwho regarded such suggestions as an undesirable concession to \nnationalism, were displeased. 72 But they needed Petrograd's support \nand succumbed to Lenin's pressure; and the knowledge of their \nelectoral weakness in the Ukraine dissuaded them from disobedience \nto the Bolshevik Central Committee. Nor did \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBukharin and the Bolshevik left have a practical alternative. But inaction had \nnever been a Bolshevik virtue; and Lenin skilfully advocated a \npractical plan which at least had the merit, in the eyes of Bolshevik \nleftists, of seeking the retention of a multinational state. Bolsheviks came to power in Baku, in \nAzerbaidzhan (as it was coming to be called); but the local Moslem \nparties and influences grew in the surrounding countryside: the \nchances of an anti-Russian alliance was growing. In Armenia, the \nzeal to break with Russia was weaker; but the Bolsheviks held little \ninfluence and would have only weakened their position if concessions \nto national feeling had not been forthcoming. In Siberia, the Socialist \nRevolutionaries were attempting to set up an autonomous state \nadministration. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. The \nCongress of Soviets in Latvia, which was already under partial \noccupation by the Germans, did the same in mid-December 1917. 78 \nPOLITICAL REPRESSION \nSovnarkom's main worries of the moment were concentrated on \nRussia. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks. Attentive \nobservers of Lenin before the October Revolution can hardly have \nbeen surprised. He had \nurged the need for a system of civil rights and judicial procedures \nwhich expressly discriminated against the bourgeoisie; and he had \ndescribed all parties to the right of the Bolsheviks as mere \nappendages of the Kadets and their pro-bourgeois interests.79 \nBut it was only after the October Revolution that most people who \nsupported the Bolsheviks became fully aware of his ferocity.80 Viktor Nogin, on \nresigning his post as People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, \npredicted that the Soviet government would steadily move towards \ntt::rrorist techniques if the Bolsheviks refused to form a broad socialist \ncoalition.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. On the contrary, Lenin approved its use by the \nJacobins in the French Revolution; and, at the Third Party Congress \nin 1905, the Bolsheviks displayed a willingness to resort to it in \nRussia if the need appeared to arise.84 There is no firm evidence available that Lenin and colleagues \nsuch as Trotski were hell-bent, before the October Revolution, on \ninstigating a campaign of summary arrest and execution of large \nnumbers of people who had committed no crime but who happened \nto belong to a social category deemed politically inimical to the \nregime.'85 \nSystematic summary repression which did not go as far as gross \nphysical maltreatment or capital punishment occurred with not only \nthe sanction but even the straightforward encouragement of the \ncentral Soviet authorities in the first month of Soviet power, and \nseveral weeks before the establishment of the All-Russian Extra-\nordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Specula-\ntion and Sabotage (or, as it appears in its Russian acronym: the \nCheka), which is rightly regarded as the forerunner of today's KGB. \nSeveral Bolshevik leaders expected that the People's Commissar-\niats of Internal Affairs and of Justice would preside over law and \norder, but Lenin had other ideas. He admired the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee's ruthlessness in rooting out saboteurs, \nspeculators and opponents of the regime; and he knew how little \ncontrol over its activities was exercised by the Petrograd Soviet. (It \nwas no accident that the Committee contained several Bolsheviks, \nincluding Felix Dzierzynski, who were to lead the Cheka). At a \nSovnarkom session under Lenin's chairmanship on 15 November, a \ndecision was taken to transfer various matters from the People's \nCommissariat of Internal Affairs to the Military-Revolutionary \nCommittee. Lenin encouraged them and protected them against \ncomplaints. 87 \nAdmittedly, the Bolshevik Central Committee and Sovnarkom \nwere not hallucinating when they talked of enemies who planned or \ncould reasonably be expected to plan armed opposition towards the \nBolsheviks. The Bolsheviks had seized power; they could scarcely \nanticipate a pat on the back from their foes. Even so, Lenin left \nnothing to chance. Closures of non-Bolshevik newspapers continued. \nCriticisms were directed at the Decree on the Pr~ss - or 'Lenin's \ndecree', as it was sometimes called - in the Central Executive \n 292 \nLenin: A Political Life \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets. Lenin brushed them casually \naside. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety.92 But by 28 November this inhibition had \ndisappeared: Lenin signed a Sovnarkom announcement that all \nmembers of the Kadet party, regardless of their opinions and \nactivity as individuals, were to be treated as 'enemies of the people' \nand placed outside the law. The Cheka's formation was not \neven dignified by the passing of a Sovnarkom decree; and no \nreference was made to the official legislative body, the Central \nExecutive Committee of Congress of Soviets. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. \nYet Lenin, too, was pondering the excessive optimism of the \nBolshevik left with growing agitation; he was relieved, in early \nDecember, when Zinoviev resumed his Central Committee seat. His main specific proposals had \nbeen for Russian soldiers to fraternise with German soldiers on the \nEastern front, and for the Soviet government to enter serious \nnegotiations for a general 'democratic peace'.97 Dukhonin procrastinated and was replaced by \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Bolshevik N. 99 Lenin and Trotski issued a proclamation \nblaming the Allied powers for compelling them to take the step. 101 \nThe Allied governments perceived that unofficial contact with \nSovnarkom was vital to inhibit Russia's complete disengagement \nfrom the War. Trotski met with their various representatives in \nPetrograd 102 Lenin, either because of preoccupation with domestic \naffairs or else because he wished others to be tainted with \ninvolvement in such unpleasant duties, held himself aloof. Trotski was already \npondering aloud whether the Russians could carry on fighting if \nGermany failed to have its expected socialist revolution. 103 Lenin, mean-\nwhile, persisted in his silence about revolutionary war. 104 He and \nTrotski at least agreed that, for the moment, the talks with the \nCentral Powers at Brest-Litovsk should be used as an instrument for \nspreading Soviet propaganda to the workers and soldiers of \nGermany. The ingenuity of the new diplomacy of the Bolsheviks \nwas countered by the subtlety of the German and Austrian \nnegotiators. Far from being embarrassed by the Soviet demand for \n'national self-determination' as the principle to underlie any general \npeace in Europe, German Foreign Secretary Ricard von Kuhlmann \nemployed it to undermine the Bolsheviks' pretensions to sovereignty \n The View from Petrograd \n295 \nover most of the old Russian empire. Consultations of popular \nopinion in the Ukraine and in regions of the Baltic provinces and the \nTranscaucasus would predictably fail to produce pro-Bolshevik \nmajorities. The Soviet \ndelegation was headed by A. Joffe, who resembled Trotski \ninasmuch as he was a left-wing Marxist who had joined the \nBolshevik party only in 1917. 106 \nLenin entered a trough of agitation. The Bolshevik \npeace policy called on soldiers to help to end the war by fraternising \nwith German soldiers and spreading the revolutionary contagion to \nthe enemy armed forces; but Russian peasants-in-uniform preferred \nsimply to desert. Soon, not only revolutionary enthusiasm among the \nRussian soldiers would be lacking, but the Russian soldiers too. 107 On 18 December, Lenin came to Sovnark-\nom with a motion stressing the need to prepare Petrograd's \ndefences. The response of \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe delegates confirmed Lenin's fears, and indeed suggested that he \nmight not be pessimistic enough. 112 So Lenin's \nmental shift was not lightly undertaken. The Germans had had an interest in helping \nthe Bolsheviks to take power, and rejoiced in the news of the October \nRevolution. But whether the Berlin government stretched out a \nhelping hand to Lenin in the last two months of 1917 is undiscover-\nable from available documents (although the German diplomats at \nBrest-Litovsk acted as if they were offering little concession, \nmonetary or political, to the Bolsheviks). 114 Yet Lenin also wished to plan carefully for the contingency \nthat such a revolution would not come to Sovnarkom's rescue and \nthat a separate peace might prove necessary. Bolshevik leaders, while \nshowing an awareness in summer 1917 of the difficulties of fighting a \nrevolutionary war, had never suggested that the alternative option, \nnamely a separate peace, was acceptable. 115 They had always \nbelieved that, if it came to a choice between a separate peace and a \nwar of revolutionary defence, no Bolshevik should sign a treaty with \nthe Germans. If Lenin was going to change his party's policy, the \npolitical campaign would make the struggle for The April Theses \n The View from Petrograd \n297 \nseem child's play. 116 No date for a reply from Petrograd \nwas set, but Lenin foresaw that Trotski's delaying tactics might soon \nprove insufficient. On 24 December 1917, Lenin set out for a few \ndays' rest in a sanatorium near the Usikirkka village railway \nstation. He was plotting how to present \nhis volte-face on the idea of a separate peace to his fellow Bolsheviks. 119 Trotski firmly opposed such a \nreorientation and secured Lenin's continued support for his pro-\ncrastinatory tactics with the delegations of Germany and Austria-\nHungary at Brest-Litovsk. But Trotski \nfelt that the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries had no \noption but to prolong the talks and call the bluff of the Central \nPowers, hoping against hope that the German workers would rise \nagainst the Kaiser or that a debilitating mutiny would occur among \nthe German forces on active service; and, for the moment, it was \nTrotski's policy which guided the Soviet negotiators. Lenin, with \ndifficulty, bided his time. He had yet to make his decisive impact on \nthe issue that had played so great a role in the Bolshevik advance on \npower: the issue of war and peace. \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDARKENING THOUGHTS \nIntimidating developments at Brest-Litovsk did not dispel the \noptimism of the Bolshevik leaders in either Petrograd or the \nprovinces. Lenin continued to call for working-class initiative, to \nwelcome factory workers in person to the Smolny Institute and to \nproclaim the ultimate objectives of communism. \nStrongly-held doctrines were not peculiar to the Bolsheviks among \nRussian political parties in the revolutionary period. The question has been asked why \nLenin failed to make a more realistic assessment of his party's \ncapacities in the first months after the October Revolution. Why did Lenin not attempt this in \nthe winter of 1917-18. Would not the pressures for the Bolsheviks \nto become more authoritarian have been smaller. 121 \nYet the Bolsheviks did not entertain a second thought (or even a \nfirst one) about introducing greater latitude for trading on the \nprivate market. The central party leadership was a collective of \nMarxist believers. The Bolsheviks, as far-left socialists, were \nhighly unlikely to regard a relaxation of controls on capitalism as \nan immediately desirable priority. 122 \nIn addition, Lenin was an extremist by the standards of most non-\nBolshevik Russian socialists, but his policies on several socio-\neconomic issues remained decidedly moderate in comparison with \nthose of many colleagues. Osinski and other \nBolshevik leftists were elaborating an agrarian policy involving the \nrapid collectivisation of peasant households. 123 Poor Lenin. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. 124 Pity for Lenin is, \nconsequently, scarcely in order. Even in The April Theses he had \nfudged the topic of 'model farms' and allowed Bolsheviks on the left \nto think that he and they were at one about agrarian policy. 127 \nThe hypothesis that Lenin had sufficient authority to introduce the \nideas of 1921 in 1917 badly misconstrues the ideological nature of \nBolshevism after the October Revolution; it also neglects the party's \norganisational disjointedness and localism. 128 \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe revolutionary elan persisted. The Saratov City Soviet, \nhaving replaced the agencies of the Provisional. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. Hierarchical obedience in \npublic institutions was rare; the administrative framework of the \nsoviets was poorly co-ordinated. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice. Kamenev, Zinoviev, \nMilyutin and other Bolshevik rightists had warned about the dangers \nof aggravating them; and Lenin, who had scoffed at the rightists' \nwarnings in October 1917, began to share their sentiments. On 4 \nNovember 1917 he announced to the Petrograd Soviet: 'Our \ndeficiency consists in the fact that our soviet organisation has not \nyet learnt to administer, that we hold too many meetings. The fact that the print-workers were interested in the \nprotection of freedom of expression for non-Bolshevik political \nparties was a strange ground for dubbing them hooligans, but Lenin \nrampantly expanded the category of imprisonable people. These he \ndesignated as 'privileged workers' who were exercised only by their \nsectional interests (which, presumably, involved a continuation of the \nwar and therefore were counterposed to Lenin's policy for a separate \npeace). Bolsheviks, he declared, \nshould seek 'to help the labouring peasant, avoid offending the \nmiddle peasant and compel the rich peasant'. Thus Lenin \nmade a quick return to the themes of class war and of the attack on \nthe richer peasants. Lenin before October had \nadvocated ideas resting on an alliance between workers and peasants.", "Bolshevik_Central_Committee_1919": " The decrees of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War must not \nbe treated as an accurate gauge of reality. Nor were Lenin and his colleagues \npusillanimous in the exercise of repression. Merciless struggle, \nmonolithic unity and and the strictest discipline were catch-phrases \nof Bolshevik public life. \nThere can equally be no doubt that the Bolsheviks were violent on a \nmassive scale even if not as comprehensively as was their officially-\nstated intention. After the Eighth Party \nCongress, Lenin and his colleagues informed local Bolshevik bodies \nthat an 'extraordinarily threatening danger' was posed from the east. The White army fled in chaotic fashion and mid-Siberia \nwas returned to Bolshevik rule. Lenin had spent the previous \nmonths calling for the forces of Kolchak to be fought and pursued \n88 \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n89 \nwithout mercy; but he did not want to appear responsible for \nKolchak's summary liquidation. He gave orders that any future official \nexplanation should suggest that local Bolsheviks were responding to a \nlocal emergency.4 To the Eastern front political commissars, fighting \nKolchak, Lenin had written on 29 May 1919: 'If we haven't conquered \nthe Urals by the winter, I consider the doom of the Revolution \ninevitable.9 \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nEarlier spats had occurred among Politburo members; but Lenin had \navoided involvement. The principal disputants were Trotski, Zinoviev \nand Stalin. On 25 March 1919 Zinoviev had complained to the Central \nCommittee that Trotski was ignoring the compromises on 'the military \nquestion' agreed by the Eighth Party Congress; and Lenin was asked to \nwrite to Trotski for redress. He urgently wanted to clear his name in regard to the \nexecution of commissar Panteleev; he also drew the Politburo attention \nto widely-felt resentment among Russians in the Red Army who felt \nthat Jews and Latvians found it easy to secure posts in the rear rather \nthan at the front. Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. Lenin, with reservations but also with decisiveness, took \nthe side of Stalin and Zinoviev. The Revolutionary-Military Council \nwas relocated to Moscow; and S. Nevertheless Lenin would not go all the way with Stalin. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July. On 3 July, as the Bolshevik Central Committee was having \nits frantic meeting in the capital, Denikin issued his Moscow Directive. \nThe Bolsheviks and their Red Army, almost to their own surprise, had \npulled off victory in the main theatre of conflict over the Russian \nempire. Lenin celebrated enthusiastically. How Lenin evaluated the \ncapacities of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich is unclear. The bulk of the population also lived under \nBolshevik rule. Very well, then: Bolshevik propaganda should be \ndiverted towards attracting their support. But they and Lenin had no illusions \nabout each other. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. There were plenty \nof them, and Lenin's misjudgement about Petrograd was simply the \none he was personally and primarily responsible for. But he had made \nfewer than most of his colleagues; and those, like Kamenev, who \nforesaw difficulties more clearly than he, would never have led the \nBolsheviks to the party's satisfaction. \nGATHERING THE LANDS \nIt had been the ending of the Great War rather than any success \nagainst the Whites that had first brought Lenin and his colleagues back \nto deliberations on the 'national question' in the former Russian \nempire. The \nConstitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (or \nRSFSR) drawn up in summer 1918 was extremely unspecific; and even \ndebate at the Eighth Party Congress had avoided specifying what \nrelations were to be pursued among the various republics. The creation of \nindependent Soviet republics had been initiated by Lenin. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Otherwise, \nLenin added, the troops of the Reds would not be treated as \n'liberators'.23 Lenin worked closely with Stalin, who was still the \nPeople's Commissar on Nationality Affairs, on all these matters. \nSovnarkom charged Stalin with the task of drawing up decrees \nrecognising the new Soviet republics. In \nthe winter of 1918-1919, Adolfloffe was sent to Belorussia to persuade \nlocal Bolsheviks that the RSFSR's interest would be served by a line of \n'buffer republics' between itself and powerful states to the west. 25 Their \nimmediate re-incorporation into an undisguisedly Moscow-based state \nmight instigate an even more British and French anti-Bolshevik \ncrusade than at present. Lenin kept a rein on policy. Leading local \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n93 \nBolsheviks in each Soviet republic were not easily reconciled to their \nown declarations of independence.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Without Lenin's \nassistance, they could not conquer their own countries. The policy of \nLenin, Stalin and Trotski had therefore to be accepted. Nikolai \nKrestinski on II January 1919 had been asked by the Central \nCommittee to clarify relations between the central party apparatus \non the one hand and the newly-formed republican governments, \nrepublican party bodies and even the People's Commissariat of \nNationality Affairs on the other.28 But the only published elucidation \nwas the Party Congress decision to treat the Ukrainian, Belorussian, \nLithuanian and Latvian Communist Parties as regional party \norganisations subordinate to the authority of the Russian Communist \nParty in Moscow. Republics could have formal independence only so \nlong as republic party bodies were strictly controlled by the Central \nCommittee and its Politburo in Moscow.29 \nThat a close formal link between the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics (and not just between party bodies) should be forged had \nbeen decided, but was not announced. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia.30 \nEvidently Lenin did not want to be seen as an initiator. For example, the Politburo on 23 \nApril 1919 resolved to ask the Ukrainian Bolshevik leadership to \nascertain how best 'a fusion of Ukraine with Soviet Russia might be \narranged'. \nFurthermore, the Bolsheviks in command of the other republics were \nnot always sensitive to national traditions - and often they carried \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthrough measures in total defiance of local society.32 For example, the \nUkrainian Bolsheviks had harassed the so-called middle peasantry and \ntried, in places, to impose collective farming by force. Consequently \nLenin may well have judged greater centralisation of authority to be \nless risky than letting the local Bolshevik-led governments enjoy much \nautonomy. Not that Lenin ever needed great encouragement to \ncentralise. Consideration was given on 12 May to a plan for the \n'unification' of the RSFSR and the Ukrainian Soviet republic with \nsingle People's Commissariats for Military Affairs, the Railways, \nFinances and Labour as well as a single Supreme Council of the \nNational Economy.33 \nUkrainian Bolshevik consent was also to be sought; and yet, even \nbefore treaty documents were signed, Lenin approved a directive to the \nparty leadership in Kiev stipulating that 'the People's Commissars of \nthe RSFSR should become People's Commissars of the Union with the \nPeople's Commissariats of Ukraine as their regional plenipotenti-\naries'. \nConsultations proceeded with Bolsheviks in the other republics. \nInstead, on 1 June 1919, a draft resolution was taken from Lev \nKamenev at the Politburo in favour of a 'military-economic union' of \nRussia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Belorussia. The Politburo controlled the entire \nparty and, despite occasions of serious disobedience, the Civil War \nwitnessed a strong insistence of authority on local Bolsheviks and \nconsequently on republic governments. In August 1919 Christian \nRakovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian Sovnarkom, was brusquely \nordered by the Politburo to close down several People's Commissariats \nand to dispense with a Ukrainian Council of Defence and Labour.36 A \ncontrast is sometimes drawn between Lenin and Stalin on basic aspects \nof the national question. Typically he \nwrote an open letter on 28 December 1919 stating that it was up to the \nworkers and peasants of Ukraine to determine 'exactly what federative \nlink' to have with Soviet Russia. But Lenin was disingenuous. Since the \nbeginning of 1918 it had been party policy to set up administrative \nenclaves wherever a non-Russian nationality lived in large numbers. It was \nplanned by Stalin's Commissariat as early as 18 March 1918, but the \nbattles with the Whites in the Volga region and the Urals rendered it \nimpracticable for a whole year. 38 \nFurthermore, the Tartars against the expectations of the Bolsheviks \nproved to be aggressively self-assertive. As if this was not enough, the \nexiguous Bolshevik cadres in the Tartar-inhabited lands could not be \ncounted on to support the formation of a Tartar Republic along the \nmodel of Bashkiria. The Politburo resolved on 13 December 1919 that \nonly with their sanction would the republic be established.40 \nThe basic problem was that, as the Mensheviks had warned the \nBolsheviks before 1917, the former Russian empire was a quilt of \ninterstitched nationalities. No single ethnic group lived alone in a \nclearly demarcated zone; and, as often as not, the attempt to designate \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch zones aggravated inter-ethnic tensions. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. He also wanted aspects of Islam to be grafted on Bolshevik \nthought.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. In addition, the non-Bolshevik members of the \nBashrevkom proved even more intractable in 1920 than in 1918-\n1919. Some who rebelled against Sovnarkom were put under arrest \nand, on Stalin's recommendation, transferred to Moscow prisons. Stalin's knowledge of the \nquestion was gaining respect among fellow central party leaders. \nOnly Lenin seriously opposed him. To Lenin, it was self-evident that \na fictional federation disguising a real centralist state was massively \npreferable to an overtly centralist state. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. A \nclash between Lenin and Stalin might be postponed, but not \npermanently avoided. Just once Lenin took a trip to \nanother Russian city after the capital's transfer to Moscow in February \n1918: this was his sojourn in Petrograd in July 1920 for the start of the \nSecond Congress of the Communist Internationa1.48 Lenin had no \nmetropolitan prejudice. But he had an exceptional inclination towards \ncentralism, and assumed that his presence in Moscow was crucial to the \nsmooth running of the central political machinery. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters. Lenin \nand his sister Mariya were being driven by chauffeur Gil to the \nSokolniki district on the outskirts of Moscow to visit his wife \nKrupskaya. They sought mercy on the grounds that they had assumed \nthey were robbing someone calling himself Levin rather than Lenin. After all, the Bolshevik \nparty was committed to the eradication of anti-semitism (and, although \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n99 \nthe fact was not bruited, Lenin was anyway part-Jewish by descent). Lenin joked about his surrender of pistol \nand wallet to the gang in terms borrowed from the lexicon of Marxism: \n'Such a compromise was akin to our compromise with the bandits of \nGerman imperialism. Lenin's telegram \nto Trotski ran as follows: 'In connection with the coded telegram from \nthe three commanders of the Eastern front I propose we should \nappoint [S. '59 \nYet his interference was limited mainly to emergencies; he recognised \nthat Trotski, Stalin and other Bolshevik commissars at the fronts had \nto take decisions without automatic detailed consultation with \nMoscow. Lenin was the motor of the political machinery. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms. The Orgburo, which had been established as a parallel \ninner subcommittee of the Central Committee to handle organisational \nquestions, yielded to the insistence that the Politburo should control \nappointments to the most important party and governmental posts.60 \nLenin habitually chaired Politburo sessions. Not even the \nPolitburo could meet regularly; Trotski, Stalin and Zinoviev were \nusually distant from Moscow. Lenin's colleagues appear \nto have treated them as reassurance that someone in the Kremlin cared \nabout them and their work. It was in the \ncollegiate deliberations of the People's Commissars that Lenin \nmanaged to put flesh on the bone of Politburo decisions. After \nSverdlov's death the legislative work of the Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets became even more of a \nformality. The Council was an adjunct of Sovnarkom; its chairman was \nLenin. At \na joint session of the Politburo and the Orgburo it was suggested, on 29 \nApril 1919, that he should write leaflets for distribution to peasants. A source of greater irritation was his \npractice of doing things through the Politburo even when there were \nenough Central Committee members currently in Moscow to make a \nquorum; but nothing was done about this until the end of 1920 (when \nPolitburo members were in dispute with each other). The \nco-ordination of the Politburo, Central Committee, Sovnarkom and \nthe Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defence was extraordinarily \ntaxing; and he did it with suitable modesty.6s But Lenin was among several \ncentral party colleagues who insisted. Lenin's refusal of \ntitles, awards and celebrations was to some extent a self-regarding \ntactic. Lenin was a fellow of simple habits. He went shooting in the forests with leading Bolsheviks. His only friends were Bolsheviks. \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNearly all were comrades rather than friends. \nEXPORT OF REVOLUTION, SIEGE ECONOMY \nThe activities of Lenin and his associates in 1919 demonstrate that, \nafter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the party still adhered to its objective \nof European socialist revolution.66 \nLenin also wished to supply military assistance to the extent that the \nRed Army was capable.68 He and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership had been \nequally cheered by the communist seizure of power in Munich. It was beginning to look as if the \npredictions made by Lenin in 1917 were coming true.'69 \nAlready, however, the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics \nappeared fragile, and Lenin sensed that the Hungarian comrades were \ntoo reckless for their own good. Lenin defended his \ncolleagues; but the sole counsel he could give was as follows: 'Hold on \nfor all you are worth, and ours shall be the victory. Not only did he and Chicherin aim to avoid giving offence to \nthe Allies; they also strained to minimise the involvement of the \nindependent states in the anti-Bolshevik military operations of the year. The matter came before the Politburo on II September, and \nit took all the pressure that Lenin could muster to secure a decision to \nend the condition of war with Latvia and Lithuania as well as with \nFinland. But Lenin pulled \nthe Politburo to his pragmatic viewpoint. Initially he had \nLenin's support.78 But subsequently Lenin agreed with Trotski that \nYudenich should not only be driven back from Petrograd but also be \nsought out and liquidated as a military force. A breach in the wall of \ninternational capitalism, Lenin felt, had been obtained. \nThrough summer 1919 Lenin kept a discreet silence about Allied \nintentions. Precisely this was said by Lenin in \nan interview with the Christian Science Monitor in September 1919.84 Nevertheless, knowing the unpopularity \nof concessions and being busy with a thousand other duties, Lenin left \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n105 \nit to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade to draw up a detailed \nplan in January.85 The incumbent supreme official was Lev Krasin, \nwho submitted theses on concessions to Sovnarkom under Lenin's \nchairmanship on 20 March 1920.86 \nSo what on earth was Lenin up to. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. Lenin was a stealthy, sinuous politician. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. The Left Communists no longer \nexisted as a separate group. He emphasised the role to be played by the trade unions as a \ncounterweight to the Bolshevik party.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.97 Stalin \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n107 \nwent along with Trotski's argumentation and became leader of the \nFirst Labour Army.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. 100 \nLenin and Trotski gave their speeches on the issues without naming \neach other in dispute; the tone was comradely. In the Central \nCommittee, however, tempers flared. Grain requisitioning was the cornerstone of \nBolshevik wartime policy: the idea that a private market in wheat and \nrye might return was anathema to the party's leaders. He never ceased to believe \nthat the Central Committee had been wrong to reject his proposal, and \ntook a bitter pleasure a year later when his persecutor Lenin instigated \na reform of food-supplies policy remarkably similar to his own. 104 But \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \non this occasion Trotski did not fight his corner. Surveys carried out in the mid-1920s were to show \nthat the great majority of the Russian population remained Christian \nby belief; and the Bolsheviks knew that in the peripheral zones of the \nold empire - in the Ukraine, the Baltic region, Georgia and Armenia -\ndevotion to national denominations had been unaltered by the calls of \nthe party to abandon the faith. Lenin \nappreciated the potential of the Patriarchate as a focus for anti-\nBolshevik opposition. 112 At the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919 he suggested that the Bolsheviks would merely give rise to \nfanaticism if offence was given to the beliefs of Christians. Lenin was \ncunning. 114 It is highly improbable that Lenin strongly disapproved. A \ntelegram from him to the Penza Soviet Provincial Executive \nCommittee on 9 August 1918 may well be the tip of a bloodstained \niceberg: 'Received your telegram.' 116 \n 110 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Russian Orthodox Church was the one remaining institution \ncapable of rallying most ethnic Russians against Sovnarkom and was \nsingled out for maltreatment by the Cheka. As early as 1903, at \nthe Second Party Congress, Lenin had brought the 'sects' to the party's \nattention. 118 \nEven so, Lenin did not publicly refer to the sects at all in the Civil \nWar. On 20 November 1917 he and Stalin had co-signed a \nproclamation to 'all labouring Moslems of Russia and the East' which \nguaranteed their freedom to worship; 121 Lenin also warned at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919 against offending Muslim \nsensibilities, and declared that the influence of the mullahs in central \nAsia was even greater than the influence of priests in Russia. But one factor must surely come \ninto the reckoning: this is that the Bolsheviks were already regarded by \nmany Russian Orthodox Christians as a gang of marauding Jews. \nThere was no disguising the fact that persons of Jewish origin were the \nlargest ethnic group in the Central Committee; and even the non-\nJewish members of the Central Committee were, by a majority, non-\nRussian. Almost certainly Lenin did not want to inflame Russian \npopular opinion by siding too openly with religious believers who did \nnot belong to Russia's national church. His decrees of 1917 and the \nSoviet Constitution of July 1918 had promulgated freedom of \nconscience in the Soviet republic. 125 \nNor was he the most avid advocate of militant atheism among the \nBolshevik party leaders. 26 Lenin won the day. Even so, he continued to \nhave to protect his position against Bolsheviks with ideas more extreme \nthan his own. He sensed a particular \npotential menace in the growing attractiveness of the works of the ex-\nBolshevik Aleksandr Bogdanov (whom Lenin since 1908 had charged \nwith the 'heinous' offence of philosophical idealism) to some of his \nclose party co11eagues. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism.' 133 In fact the Bolsheviks had yet again been \nmisinformed. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But he urged that Bolsheviks in the \nmeantime should look on the bright side and get on with 'the peaceful \ntasks of economic construction'. 136 \nNikolai Krestinski followed Lenin with the Central Committee's \norganisational report. But at the second session, on 30 March, the \nCentral Committee was rebuked. \nSapronov, the Democratic Centralist: 'In that case I put the question to \ncomrade Lenin: just who is it who will be appointing the C[entral] \nC[ommittee]. Kaganovich pleaded for greater \ncentralist severity did the tirades against Lenin relent. Volin \nand others praised the Central Committee.142 Trotski, turning to the \nUkraine-based opponents of the central party apparatus, questioned \ntheir own efficiency by claiming that, out of every hundred activists \nthey mobilised to the Red Army, 'five went and ninety deserted.'143 \nKrestinski did not trade insults, 144 1eaving it for Lenin to summarise \nthe case for the Central Committee. 151 But Lenin \nrepaid Trotski's assistance to him. He also quoted from his 1918 \npamphlet The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Smirnov comically asked what would happen to \nTrotski if Lenin took over the government singlehandedly. Central Committee member \nM. Tomski as the party's \nappointee as chairman of the All-Russian Central Council of the Trade \nUnions.161 Lenin left things to his \ncolleagues according to the pre-arrangement of the Central Committee. Radek's report on the Communist Interna-\ntional was delivered without accompanying debate in the evening; and \non the next day, 2 April, the delegates reduced discussion on the co-\noperative movement and on political organisation by establishing \nseparate sections to compose drafts for submission to Congress. 163 Lenin had less reason to thank his \ncolleagues in the other section. 164 His demarche was a \nreminder that even the more cautious Bolsheviks were yet Bolshe-\nviks: Milyutin overlooked peasant attitudes to nationalisation. But it was an accurate assessment of Lenin's status: the Congress \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreversed the section's choice and took Krestinski's draft theses as the \nbasis of its resolution. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. Lenin was unconcerned that \nleaders closer to Trotski than to him -\nA. Sergeev: each of them preferred Lenin \nto Trotski. 169 In any case this was not a Central Committee of factions.", "Bolshevik_Central_Committee_1920": " \nLENIN AND TROTSKJ \nBolsheviks wanted the Soviet state to guide all public and private \ninstitutions in their expanding republic. \nThe Bolshevik party had expounded such an ambition soon after the \nOctober Revolution, and elaborated it in its party programme at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919. Even among Bolsheviks there \nwere inhibitions about the desirable scope of the state's pretensions. The fact that the party had used \nviolence against the working class had not eradicated a feeling among \nBolsheviks that the interests of the workers should be protected. Leading Bolshevik \ntrade unionists, such as Central Committee member Mikhail Tomski, \nwere comfortable with the notion of a one-party and one-ideology \nstate. Trotski, People's \nCommissar of Military Affairs, requested the militarisation of Soviet \npublic life. Lenin despaired of his Politburo and Red Army colleague. There \nhad been assaults on Lenin's management of both the Polish campaign \nand the party's internal affairs, and a resolution had been passed on the \nneed to reform party organisation. Lenin coped with the Conference by \nputting it out of his mind as soon as the delegates went home. In Lenin's estimation, these were the issues requiring urgent \nattention. \nIn Trotski's opinion, the working class of 1917 no longer existed. Lenin, as he had shown in controversy after controversy before the \nGreat War and would show again in the foreign-trade discussion of \n1922, was even more likely to act in such a fashion. His abrasiveness \ntowards the Democratic Centralists and Workers' Opposition did not \ncease, and he remained unapologetic about the political departments \nwhich had been castigated at the Ninth Party Conference by many \nlocal committee men who otherwise supported the Lenin-Trotski \nleadership. Lenin would tolerate him no \nmore. Tomski returned from the Conference of Trade Unions, where \nhe had officially represented the Bolshevik Central Committee, and \n Less Politics. \nPressing their case, Lenin and his group proposed counter-theses which \nwere accepted by ten votes to four. 10 \nBut at this point something odd happened: a so-called 'buffer group' \nemerged consisting of several Central Committee members. 11 But Zinoviev was \nnot a reconciler and Tomski had had a blazing polemic with Trotski at \nthe Congress of Trade Unions; 12 Rykov had been the butt ofTrotski's \nsarcasm at the Ninth Party Congress; 13 Artem had previously hugged \nclose to Lenin. These were \non the 'left' of the Bolshevik political spectrum: Bukharin, Dzierzynski, \nKrestinski, Radek and Serebryakov. 15 Thus ten Central Committee \nmembers out of nineteen, including some who were absent, resolved to \nhold the two protagonists apart. Lenin was forced to back off. 16 \nThe commission's composition was balanced equally between Lenin \nand Trotski. Lenin was represented by Rudzutak, Trotski by himself. 19 Like all the \nBolshevik leaders, he had a genuine ideological commitment. \n 156 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski refused to participate in the charade. The matter came before the Central \nCommittee on 7 December. \nThis time he was more aggressive than Lenin. Lenin had gained a new ally in the person of Zinoviev.22 But the stand-off between Lenin and \nTrotski meant that his reduced group held the balance of power in the \nCentral Committee; and, although not all of the group's members liked \nhis specific slogan, it was sufficiently vague to allow them to force it \nthrough as Central Committee policy. Lenin was as \nannoyed with Bukharin in 1920 as with Trotski two years previously. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. It had not been debated \noutside the Central Committee; and Trotski, once worsted by Lenin's \ncontinued support for comprehensive grain requisitioning, dropped the \nmatter. \nLenin remained extraordinarily complacent. It was \nKalinin, not Lenin, who insisted on 14 September that the Politburo \nshould establish a commission of enquiry into the conditions of the \npeasantry.28 \nVisiting peasants, however, did not let Lenin forget them.30 Lenin's defence of official policy was not quite as \ndogged as usual. 31 Lenin hoped to indicate that the Politburo was mindful of the \npeasantry's distress. \nLenin rejoiced. \nThis gave Lenin the chance to re-think War Communism.38 In the Civil War the Bolsheviks had exacted taxes, \ngrain and conscripts from village communes as a whole. Compensation on an individual basis was thought to \nsmack of indulgence to the kulak; and, even though the committees of \nthe village poor were disbanded in Russia in December 1918, class \nstruggle in the countryside remained the state's conscious objective. Let \nus be clear about Lenin's new thinking.39 Opinions were divided, and Lenin and Preobrazhenski were \ninstructed on 20 December to draft a resolution on the agrarian \nquestion presentable to the Eighth Congress of Soviets.40 \nOn the same day Lenin gave a report to the Bolshevik fraction on \nforeign concessionnaires.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. Not only the Workers' \nOpposition but many other Bolshevik speakers saw concessions as a \nbetrayal of the Revolution, the proletariat, Marx and communism.44 \nLenin had greatly misjudged the adaptiveness of his party. Lenin trimmed his report on behalf of \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSovnarkom of those aspects which had been most contentious. Disagreements in the \nCentral Committee about the trade unions were being aired at the \nCongress of Soviets; and Bolshevik delegates had to be carefully \ncourted if the Congress was not to turn into a fiasco. Strife returned to the Bolsheviks \nwith a vengeance.45 \nWhat saved him from humiliation was the unreadiness of Bolsheviks \nto undo him in front of the small number of Mensheviks, Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Left SRs at the Congress. The Bolshevik party's \nmonopoly was not yet total, not quite. Furthermore, it did Lenin no harm \nthat these other socialist parties were asking for a reform of economic \npolicy more basic than Lenin's proposal.46 \nLenin dissociated himself from such an abandonment of War \nCommunism. He railed against peasants who became involved in what \nthe Bolsheviks called speculation.47 \nBut Lenin was still not out of the woods. Polemics on the agrarian \nquestion were almost inevitable even when Bolshevik delegates to the \nCongress were on their best behaviour. On 24 December, Lenin \nrepeated to a Bolshevik fraction meeting that a turn towards 'the \npeasant individual economy' was required.49 Even \nLenin, however, was taken aback at the vituperative discussion which \nensued. Despite his best efforts, the Bolshevik fraction at the Congress \nrejected the Lenin-Preobrazhenski proposals on the grounds that they \nfavoured only the kulak. Lenin was angry. \nThe Central Committee met in the emergency on 27 December, and \nLenin described in graphic detail how truculent the Bolshevik delegates \n Less Politics. \nLenin was empowered to go back to the fraction to re-assert the policy \nof the Central Committee.51 Lenin was \njaunty.56 The Central Committee duly \ntook up the case on 24 February. Even so, it was only by eight votes to six that \nthe plan was accepted in principle by the Central Committee; and, as a \nsop to the critics, Lenin had to agree to Aleksei Rykov being asked to \ninvestigate how the Soviet republic would go about independently \nreconstructing the oil industry if the attempt were to be made. Lenin was present and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfollowed the coffin through the cold, snow-laden streets.' 58 Lenin and Inessa probably had a sexual liaison \nof some kind before the Great War, and the emotional tie persisted. Even so, the Central \nCommittee was not influential for very long. \n163 \ndiscussion', commenced on 30 December under the gaze of the \nBolshevik party fraction at the Congress of Soviets. Lenin and \nZinoviev stood together against Trotski. Lenin \nconcentrated his fire on Trotski.' Lenin declared that the working class still needed unions to \nprotect its interests. \u00b7n \nLenin had come upon a formula that would see off his adversaries: it \nconveyed pride in the results of the October Revolution while \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that the workers had a continuing need of protection by \ntrade unions. Lenin exploited the \nadvantage he held through having a majority in the commission on \ntrade unions set up by the Central Committee. The commission \ncompleted a draft decree for the Tenth Party Congress, and Lenin and \nhis colleagues signed their approval of it on 14 January 1921. Despite having most Central \nCommittee members on his side, Lenin could not manipulate the \nadministrative levers of a Secretariat staffed by Trotski's sympathisers: \nKrestinski, Serebryakov and Preobrazhenski.76 The underlying explanation is that \nLenin stood for party unity and was able to portray Trotski as a \nsplitter. Trotski reacted \nby claiming that Lenin's indulgence to the unions was a rhetorical ploy. \nTo a large extent Trotski was right (even though it is equally true that \nLenin was hostile to the extreme anti-unionism of Trotski). And yet \nBolsheviks in the localities faced conditions which could no longer be \nhandled exclusively by command and violence. Yuri Milonov, the \nSamara provincial party leader was unwitting to call for the \nabrogation of the party's dominance over the soviets and trade \nunions; and E. lgnatov, a Bolshevik official in Moscow, wished to \nsupply the soviets with the right to veto appointments in the trade \nunions. Both baulked at the request of Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra \nKollontai for an equitable division of powers among party, soviets and \ntrade unions. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd. 78 Lenin castigated \nShlyapnikov as an anti-party syndicalist and his ideas as a 'syndicalist \ndeviation' from Bolshevism.79 Lenin ignored the evidence. Shlyapnikov \ndid not want to abolish the Bolshevik party; his platform was not \ndesigned to entrust the working class with untrammeled power. He was \nnot a syndicalist, and Lenin knew it. Yet Lenin, having been patient \nwith his party critics until the Eighth Congress of Soviets in December, \nhad his blood up.80 \nLenin introduced a philosophical dimension to the discussion: \nalways a sign of his irritation. A \nPolitburo decision was taken on 28 January 1921 enjoining Trotski and \nZinoviev, who were on an investigatory mission for the Council of \nLabour and Defence in the Urals, to relegate questions about the trade \nunions to the background. Resentment of Bolshevik political and \neconomic policies within a garrison that had supplied the shock troops \nfor the party in 1917 was reaching boiling point. The peasantry hated the \ncontinuation of the forcible requisitioning of food, the imposition of \nlabour duties and the military conscription of their young men; and \ntheir discontent was clearly focussed on the Bolshevik party and its \ncommissars.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A. They were determined to \nsecure justice for their cause, and offered a still greater threat to Lenin \nand his associates in 1921 than they had to Kerenski in 1917. It is also clear that the striking workers and \nmutineering sailors did not yet unduly bother Lenin and his associates. \nEqually interesting is the lack of Lenin's prominence in the debate.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.97 Since the October Revolution the tendency of \nBolshevik policy had been in the direction of reinforced state \nregulation of the economy. He had taken detailed notes on grievances expressed \nat a special meeting of non-Bolshevik peasant delegates at the Eighth \nCongress of Soviets on 22 December 1920.98 In addition, he visited \ncertain villages in Moscow province: Yaropolets on 14 November 1920 \nand Modenovo on 15 December 1920. \nPeasants also streamed into the capital seeking an audience with the \nSoviet leader throughout the winter of 1920-1921. Their memoirs were to be written within a political \nenvironment that brooked no criticism of the Bolshevik party and \nSoviet government; and, in any case, the nature of his office was bound \nto deter people from speaking frankly even to a man of Lenin's \nrenowned approachability. 102 The first Bolshevik \nofficial to do so in Lenin's presence was V. 103 \nDid Sokolov finally change Lenin's mind. \nAt a conference of metal-workers on 4 February 1921 Lenin merely \nhinted at the direction of his thought. Four full members were present: Lenin, \nKamenev, Stalin and Krestinski. 107 It was at \nthis meeting that Lenin, having listened to a report by Deputy People's \nCommissar for Agriculture N. \nLenin's draft was scribbled out on a single sheet of paper and handed \nto a working party consisting of Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Osinski. The intra-party discussions in early 1918 had nearly \nbroken up the party. Already the Bolsheviks were at sixes and sevens \nabout the trade unions; and, at a moment of peasant revolts, Lenin had \nto handle his collapsible party with extreme care. \nPolitburo meetings throughout February decided the personnel and \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \npractical measures needed to crush the resistance to Bolshevik party \npower. A cautious approach was \nmaintained: the participants would be lesser Bolsheviks and not the \nparty's leaders. Several amend-\nments had been made to Lenin's sketch. 119 Neither \nLenin nor anyone else in the Politburo looked on the reform with \nenthusiasm, and no one wanted to incur unpopularity for pushing it \nthrough without the consent of most party leaders. 122 It was a blow for the consensus achieved in the Politburo; \nbut even Lenin, while disagreeing with Tsyurupa, had opposed the re-\nemergence of middlemen who would take grain for sale in other towns. 123 \nNevertheless Lenin might not have reconciled the Party Congress to \nthe tax in kind if popular rebellions had not intensified. It was by no \nmeans universally accepted in the party that a lowered level of state-\nprocured grain would alleviate urban food-supply difficulties; and the \nvehemence of the Bolshevik fraction's reaction to the much milder \nproposal for agrarian reform made by Lenin and Preobrazhenski at the \nEighth Congress of Soviets lingered in the Politburo's memory. Strikes and food \nshortages shook the minds of all Bolsheviks in Moscow. The Moscow \nsituation was so serious that Trotski, who had just returned from the \nUrals, was appointed as 'chairman of the defence committee of the city \nof Moscow'. Strikes broke out \nin Petrograd, and an anti-Bolshevik leaflet campaign had been \norganised. 125 The Politburo called in the Cheka. On 2 March the Kronstadt garrison, having been \ndisobeying orders for two whole days, arrested their pro-Bolshevik \ncommanders and political commissars. The original advocates \nof the tax were denounced by some Bolshevik activists as being \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSocialist Revolutionaries (as indeed Sokolov had once been);128 and \nthe tax was said to involve a re-installation of 'bourgeois relations' in \nthe economy (as in fact it did). 129 From Bolshevik leaders in the \nUkraine, including the entire Ukrainian Central Committee, there had \ncome a protest that a tax in kind would impede the People's \nCommissariat of Food Supplies from extricating any grain whatsoever \nfrom the peasants at a time of an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt across \nthe southern provinces.130 \nBut Lenin held firm.131 Nor did he fait to \nemphasise that the contents of the Ukrainian Bolshevik protest had \nacknowledged that the local working-class population already \ndemanded such a reform so that they could barter with the \npeasantry. 132 The Central Committee in Moscow fell into line with \nthe Politburo's recommendations. This time Lenin took charge, becoming commission \nchairman. But it is equally true that, if Lenin had not headed the \ncampaign for reform, the proposal would probably not have reached \nthe agenda sheet of the Tenth Party Congress. \nLENIN'S COHORT \nThe party remained in a condition of shock at the divergence between \nLenin and Trotski over the trade unions.135 In 1918, during the \nBrest-Litovsk disrute, Lenin and Trotski had avoided trenchant \nmutual criticisms. The London magazine Punch \ncarried a detailed pen-and-ink sketch of Trotski brawling in an office \nand knocking askew a wall-picture of Lenin. 138 Only Lenin was recognised by him as equally talented \nas himself: the rest of the Central Committee were subject to his airy \ndismissiveness; and, coming into a room of commanders and political \ncommissars, he was quite capable of letting his cloak fall to the ground \nand leaving someone else to pick it up. \nLenin and Trotski knew that such a menace was not as acute as it \nappeared. Trotski had been asked by Lenin in the October Revolution \nto become People's Commissar for Internal Affairs. To be sure, he may have been exaggerating concern \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nabout his ethnic origin in order to avoid receiving certain posts.144 \nFurthermore, his readiness to turn the party upside down in pursuit of \nhis preferred policies was demonstrated by the 'trade union discussion'; \nand his behaviour after Lenin's death hardly betokens a person \nreluctant to inherit the position of dominant party leader. \nNevertheless in the winter of 1920-1921, while Lenin enjoyed the \nappearance of good health, Trotski fought him over policy only; there \nwas no attempt to reduce Lenin in importance. \nTrotski was undoubtedly putting a sincere case, and he was right to \nargue that the trade-union question touched on almost every aspect of \nthe party's strategy: state power, economic reconstruction, workers' \nrights, local self-government; but he should also have known that the \naverage party official, tried and tested in the heat of the military \nconflict of 1917-1920, felt that debate was a luxury which was ill-\naffordable by the Bolsheviks. Scarcely a month \npassed when Lenin omitted to make such a comment. Instead the \ntalk among Bolshevik party officials was that, with his power-base in \nthe Red Army, he might become the Napoleon of the Soviet regime. \nBolsheviks thought much about the precedents in the history of the \nFrench Revolution. Trotski's non-Bolshevik past and his abrasive \ntreatment of the party in 1918-1920 gave grounds for the fear that a \nBonapartist counterrevolution might be undertaken under his leader-\nship.J46 \nLenin meanwhile gained from his evident wish to deflect the party \nfrom a damaging discussion. \n175 \nas if the sole way open to them to prove that they were still Joyal \nBolsheviks was to refer affectionately to 'Vladimir Ilich' . Zinoviev hurried round the \nmajor party organisations on Lenin's behalf, talking stingingly about \nthe People's Commissar for Military Affairs. Those Bolsheviks who \nhad been at the front in the Civil War, he emphasised, had scant \nunderstanding of conditions and possibilities in the rear. There was an obvious \ndanger that Trotski would make privileged use of the Central \nCommittee Secretariat. Lenin would have certainly have done so if \nhe thought he could have got away with it. 151 This group, forced to \ncome off the fence dividing Lenin and Trotski, scared Lenin in 1921 by \ndeciding initially in favour of Trotski.' 153 Zinoviev's platform, more \nthan Lenin's, conceded that appointmentism was a problem in the \nparty. Lenin revelled in verbal \nambiguity. At a time of strikes and mutinies there could be little \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprospect of prolonging their existence, and Trotski complied. Party organisation after organisation, despite \nTrotski's visits to them in person, came over to Lenin's side. Weeks \nbefore the Tenth Party Congress Lenin had won the 'trade union \ncontroversy' . Lenin \nrestrained his associates from taking heavy revenge upon Trotski, and \nargued that only two thirds of the seats in the new Central Committee \nshould be saved for themselves. A cabal of fifteen leading 'Leninists' was addressed by \nhim as the Congress gathered in Moscow. Here Lenin put the case that \nTrotski should be included on their slate for election since he would be \nin a permanent minority in the Central Committee and disabled from \ncausing a split in the party. But Lenin also insisted that the main supporters ofTrotski \nshould be removed; Krestinski, Preobrazhenski, Serebryakov and \nI. Lenin must already have had it in mind to give full \nmembership in the Politburo to Zinoviev in return for his part in \nTrotski's defeat, and discussions were under way to fill the Secretariat \nwith officials who had taken Lenin's line in the winter of 1920-1921.'59 \nIn addition, Lenin planned to call a meeting of all those who agreed \nwith him on the trade unions. Lenin was amused: 'What's this I hear from a died-in-the-wool old \nfactionalist. \nTHE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Tenth Party Congress was opened by Lenin in the morning on 8 \nMarch I 92 I. \nAt the evening session Lenin delivered the long-awaited Central \nCommittee political report. 16s \nLenin's implicit argument was that the peasantry's capacity to \ndestabilise the authorities had been underestimated. Lenin declared that the \nfactional disagreements in the Bolshevik party were an intellectual \nluxury. Lenin described it as a 'petit-bourgeois counter-\nrevolution' more dangerous than the White invasions of Kolchak, \nDenikin and Yudenich. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry. 171 The \nreal drama lay with Lenin's strategical change since the previous \nCongress. Skvortsov-Stepanov, Lenin had set \nthe programme for the proceedings. Lenin's attitude to the Workers' \nOpposition would only cause further disunity. Osinski, for the Democratic Centralists, \nagreed with Lenin that syndicalism had grown as a force in the \nparty. Nor was Lenin immune from criticism. Sosnovski, a supporter of Trotski in the trade-union contro-\nversy, quipped that Lenin had barely mentioned the workers.176 Back came Yuri Milonov for the \nWorkers' Opposition, claiming that Lenin as Sovnarkom chairman \n Less Politics. It was his contention that the strict line on the trade unions \naccepted by Lenin at the previous Party Congress was responsible for \nstimulating working-class discontent. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin. In Moscow, as he pointed out, 'the arch-democrat Stalin' \nhad been organising Lenin's faction as if an internal party war were \nbeing fought. Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends. 180 That evening, \nat session four, Lenin's report was approved by 514 votes against 47 for \nthe Democratic Centralists and 45 for the Workers' Opposition. With the recent conquest of the Transcaucasus in \neveryone's mind, Stalin stressed the party's objective of equal rights for \nall nationalities; and he expatiated a bit on the tendency of several \nRussian Bolsheviks to indulge in 'Russian Great-Power chauvinism'. 185 \nFurthermore, Lenin in 1921 would indubitably have been annoyed by \nStalin's dismissiveness about national self-determination. The slogan \nremained dear to Lenin. Still Lenin kept himself out of the \nway. \nLenin played his part again. 195 \nNothing was left to chance, and Lenin on the same day as the last of \nthe emergency sessions penned drafts of his two motions on the \nsyndicalist deviation and on party unity. 196 In the first motion, the \nWorkers' Opposition was condemned for is allegedly anti-Marxist \nideas; in the second, factional activity in general was banned on pain of \nexpulsion from the Central Committee for any faction's leader (and \nfrom the party for the faction as a whole).200 But Trotski did little to promote \nhis case on the unions beyond asserting that the Central Committee's \nmotion was so lacking in fluency that Lenin could not have scrutinised \nit closely. Lenin was not pressed unduly \nhard when he spoke on Zinoviev's behalf (although he did not desist \nfrom charging Trotski with having broken Central Committee \ndiscipline with his unleashing of the trade-union controversy).202 \nTrotski retorted very reasonably that he had infringed no disciplinary \ncode; he quoted, too, Lenin's statement at the Ninth Party Congress \nagainst the 'rubbish' spoken on behalf of democratic practices in the \ntrade unions. All 479 votes were cast to confirm Lenin's membership. Out of \nthe other Politburo members, Stalin came sixth in the Central \nCommittee list, Trotski a humiliating tenth and Zinoviev - who had \nbeen the peripatetic champion of Lenin's line on the trade unions in the \nwinter - an even more distressing eighteenth. \nOnly then did Lenin step forward with the Central Committee report \non the end to grain requisitioning. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'.206 At present the peasants were \ndiscontented, and Lenin added: 'Classes cannot be tricked.214 \nTwo speakers followed in Lenin's support, including Evgeni \nPreobrazhenski: the Bolshevik Left contained many who saw that \nsome reform was urgently necessary. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'.218 \nLenin had handled the Congress superbly. Lenin was \nvital to the re-orientation of policies.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'.220 And yet even he, the leading figure on the Bolshevik \nRight, took a stern view. Then, in the closing minutes, Lenin quickly \nintroduced the two debates on party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist \ndeviation.", "Exile_In_Shushenskoe_1905": "29 And, \nwhile in exile in Shushenskoe, he had warned fellow social-democrats \nagainst adopting the neo-Kantian notions then becoming popular \namong \nAustrian \nMarxists.", "Tsarism_1905": " PETERSBURG \nVoices were raised at court, as well as in monarchist organisations in \nthe country, urging Nikolai II to retract his Manifesto. Yet such \nrecommendations overestimated the power available to the tsarist \ngovernment. Tsarism lacked a mass \nmovement of support; there was no social class, save for the gentry, \nwhich it could reliably mobilise. Consequently the semi-\nconstitutional manoeuvres of 1905-6 were probably the nearest that \nthe imperial government could prudently move towards the main-\ntenance of its centuries-old prerogatives. Petersburg. Petersburg even if no Manifesto had \nbeen issued). But there was another Lenin \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \n(and many more besides). In the second half of 1905 it was this Lenin who \ncame to the fore.1S Lenin by contrast was almost benign. Petersburg. \nON PHILOSOPHY AND ON THE SOVIETS \nLenin and Bogdanov announced their differences over soviets and \ntrade unions as being of secondary importance in the winter of 1905-6; \nthe overriding task was to prepare an uprising to instal a provisional \nrevolutionary government. Lenin's view, as sketched in \nNovember 1905 and elaborated in his 1906 pamphlet Victory of the \n Predicting the Tide \n145 \nKadets, was different: he wanted the soviets to act as 'the embryos of \nthe new revolutionary power' . The Petersburg Soviet should initiate the process \nby selecting representatives to announce themselves as 'the pro-\nvisional revolutionary government of all Russia' . He \ncensured Akselrod, Dan and Martov even though they were the party's \nonly theorists who produced articles which prefigured the emergence \nof the soviets in late 1905.56 \nFAILURE OF INSURRECTION \nIf Lenin's thinking in 1905 was more tension-laden than was custom-\nary even for him, it must be appreciated that Russian politics changed \nwith bewildering rapidity inside a few months. Semen Shvarts \nwas then a Bolshevik agitator in the capital. On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. \nThe Petersburg Soviet's life was ended as suddenly as it had begun.61 \nLenin's influence over events in St.62 The \nMoscow Soviet sanctioned the uprising. \nTAMPERE AND THE DUMA \nWhile insurrection took place in Moscow, a Conference of Bolsheviks \nwas being held to the north. Petersburg.66 The crisis in Moscow led to a \nbreakdown of communications between Russia and Finland. Insurrection remained the Bolshevik \npriority.73 \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction. Lenin and Martov were present. Tsarism was not on the verge of collapse. The tsar aimed to counterweight the Duma with an \nImperial Council, whose members would be chosen by himself and \nvarious public institutions.9o \nThe disagreement between Maslov and Lenin over agrarian policy \nreflected differing expectations about the post-tsarist Russian state.91 Lenin, as a Bolshevik, envisaged a \ndifferent scenario. The Romanov dynasty's overthrow was to be \nfollowed by a temporary dictatorship which would initiate socio-\neconomic reforms that might render the chances of counterrevolution \ninfinitely remote. Discussion \ncovered the entirety of Russian history. Maslov, Plekhanov and Martynov maintained that, \nwhereas in western Europe it had been social conflicts and technologi-\ncal discoveries which had caused the emergence of the feudal state, in \nRussia it had been the state itself which transformed society. Russian \nfeudalism was a bastard variant. Suddenly, a \ndecade later, his historiographical differences with Plekhanov were \nseen to underpin a question of enormous immediate relevance: what \nwas the nature of this tsarist state and how best could social-democrats \ndismantle it.98 Lenin \ncame some way to accommodating Suvorov's objection. And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from 1906, that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October 1917 by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions. This was Akselrod's \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreport on the Duma. A Bolshevik Centre was secretly established.", "Tsarism_1890": " And the tsarist political \npolice was under-equipped to organise surveillance of all undergradu-\nate groups and gatherings. The administra-\ntion was Russian, but Tartars constituted a substantial minority of the \ninhabitants and were unreconciled to tsarist dominion. This council met in November to discuss ways to \nsupport the anti-tsarist disturbances organised by the students of \nMoscow university. \nPetersburg. Disagreements about policy divided the \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmembership.16 We have seen that Vladimir I1ich borrowed some political \nand philosophical attitudes from Chernyshevski. 26 \nMARX AND ENGELS \nMarx's ideas and Russian populism, while coinciding in several \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nimportant areas, diverged in others of equal significance. \nOn the whole, the narodniki had denied that a parliament, even if it \nwere to be set up in Russia, was a suitable forum of activity for \nrevolutionaries. And capitalism would be supplanted, ultimately, by \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncommunism. Again this was an attractive pattern of thought to Ulyanov, who \naimed to counter the narodnik contention that Russia had an \nexceptional destiny in store if only the political will was shown by the \nrevolutionary movement.46 \nIt has been pointed out that Marx allowed for a variety of routes of \nsocial development in the epochs prior to socialism; and that he used \nthe concept of 'Asiatic despotism' rather than 'feudalism' to designate \na number of societies in the East. \nRUSSIAN MARXISM AND RUSSIAN POPULISM \nThis meant that debate among Russian Marxists could not be confined \nto the generalities of Marxism. Russia's particularities required consideration. In 1877 he \nwrote to the populist Mikhailovski denying that Das Kapital pre-\nscribed a model of historical development for all countries. Both he and \nEngels felt that the assassination of the emperor might so destabilise \nthe political situation as to detonate revolution in Russia. In addition Petr Tkachev, theorist of narodnik terrorism, \nwas also one of Europe's most distinguished Marxologists in the 1870s. Engels and Tkachev engaged in \npublic dispute in 1874. But he did so not because he \nthough it would destroy tsarism but rather with the ambition of \npressuring the government to grant political freedoms. \nNevertheless other populist ideas lived on in Russian Marxism. \nMikhailovski accused the Russian Marxists of callous disregard for the \nsufferings ofthe peasantry in the 1891 famine; they were charged with \ncondoning any phenomenon, however oppressive to the mass of the \npopulation, so long as it helped capitalist development. Maslovin the 1890s. In fact, by the \nturn of the century, there even appeared Russian Marxists (among \nwhom the most notable was L. \nGEORGI PLEKHANOV'S MARXISM \nHe was not without assistance from other Marxists in elaborating his \nMarxism; and the Russian who most influenced him was Georgi \nValentinovich Plekhanov. Russian Marxism received its baptism of \nfire in a struggle with agrarian socialism. This made the early Russian \nMarxists keen to demonstrate the validity of their self-description as \nMarxists; and their edginess was exacerbated by the statements made \nin the 1880s by Marx and Engels. Perhaps it was only in 1892, when \nEngels at last declared that capitalism had decisively gripped the \nRussian economy,67 that the coolness towards the experiments in \nRussian Marxism fully vanished. Premature attempts by socialists to seize power in Russia \n Roads to Freedom \n41 \nhad to be averted. Both books were acclaimed in most respects by all \nyoung Russian Marxists. Das Kapital contained little about the peasantry; but \nPlekhanov endeavoured to show that Marxian categories of analysis \nwere applicable to the changing economic relationships in the depths \nof rural Russia. His \ntwo early books were a crucial contribution to the Russian Marxist \ndoctrine that capitalism was on the verge of pervading all economic \nrelations in town and countryside.73 European history contained many examples of slow, steady \nprocesses of change interrupted by unexpected explosions of discon-\n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntent. But it lived on \nin the memory of Europe's revolutionaries. The Emancipation Of \nLabour Group wished to be in a position to take full advantage of any \nsimilar situation which might arise in Russia. Even Russian economic backwardness was to be \nregarded as an asset: it would mean that socialist ideas could be \ndisseminated among Russia's working class at an earlier stage in the \ncountry's economic transformation than had been possible in Britain, \nFrance or Germany. This was that industrial \nworkers were the 'vanguard' of the social forces opposed to the \nRussian monarchy. All the other \nclasses and groups were likely to make compromises with tsarism. \nPlekhanov's colleague Akselrod therefore urged that industrial work-\ners should maintain 'hegemony' over the anti-monarchical movement \nin Russia.78 His Group felt that such a programme \nwould provide the political and economic framework necessary for the \nmaturation of Russian capitalism.79 Such a viewpoint was not \nin keeping with the outlook of Karl Kautsky and other theorists of the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party in the 1890s (even though Marx \nhimself had approved of an assassination campaign in Russia). It is equally \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvisible in his treatment of the subsequent measures for the eventual \ndismemberment of capitalism itself.84 \nACTIVISM IN SAMARA \nIt took time for the Marxist circles in the Russian empire to acquire \ntheir organisational identity. Petersburg led by the Bulgarian D.8s But revolutionaries of Russian origin also \nwere bestirring themselves in the same direction: towards Marxism. \nCould it be that in 1890 and 1891 he detected the inadequacies in \nagrarian-socialist views without yet embracing a Russian Marxist \nperspective.", "Ownership_To_Pass_1905": " But Maslov, in accord with his ideas of 1902, \nwanted ownership to pass to local urban authorities.", "Bolshevik_Strategy_1905": " Soviets were springing \nup in towns and cities; as many as fifty had established themselves by \nthe end of 1905. Bogdanov hastened back \ninto Russia in 1904.6 Lenin refused all \ninvitations to emulate their action. Petersburg.lO \nLenin was irate that no one had even asked his opinion. \nThey had plans, well before the Manifesto, to start a legal Bolshevik \nnewspaper based in Russia (and perhaps its creation would have \ncompelled Lenin to go back to St. Petersburg even if no Manifesto had \nbeen issued).14 \nThose acquainted only with the Lenin of Two Tactics knew solely a \nprophet of all-out strategical offensive. But there was another Lenin \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \n(and many more besides). In the second half of 1905 it was this Lenin who \ncame to the fore. He now claimed, to Bogdanov's bemusement, to be \nquite unbothered by the prospect of joining up again with the \nMensheviks; he even chided those Bolsheviks who 'exaggerated' the \npoints of dispute between the two factions.15 Bogdanov too wanted to \nsecure Bolshevik dominance inside a re-unified social-democratic \nparty; but many local groups of Bolsheviks were destroying his \nbargaining position by recombining with Menshevik groups without \nthe Central Committee's permission.1S Lenin by contrast was almost benign. He conceded that the \nBolshevik Central Committee (as if he himself had played no role in \nthe matter) had in the past unfairly cashiered social-democratic \ncommittees led by Mensheviks. Lenin \nwanted to delay it until spring 1906; but he again noted ruefully that \nthe Central Committee had not invited his advice.1s He worried even \nmore about the attitude of many Bolsheviks to non-party working-\nclass organisations. Lenin did not endorse \ntheir general viewpoint any more than previously; but he shared the \npriority given by Martov and Akselrod to ensuring that social-\ndemocrats did not let other political parties dominate the organisations \nof the Russian labour movement.19 Lenin now welcomed the Men-\nsheviks in the party as a means of putting pressure on his own \nBolsheviks to bend more readily in his own direction of policy. Petersburg.21 He \nalready knew of the Petersburg Soviet. He brought with him a draft \narticle advocating Bolshevik participation, expecting to get it pub-\nlished in Novaya Zhizn. Bogdanov's policy \nhad been that the Central Committee should involve itself in the \n Predicting the Tide \n143 \nPetersburg Soviet only on condition that the Soviet accepted the \nsocial-democratic programme. The Soviet had predictably repudiated \nthis demand. The Central Committee had thereupon urged all \nBolsheviks to withdraw from the Soviet.24 It took weeks for Lenin to \nsoften this intransigence. It \ncould hardly have been otherwise; the Bolsheviks, if ever they were \ngoing to organise an insurrection, were bound to have to enter mass \nworking-class organisations. Trotski's name, not Lenin's, \nwas on Petersburg workers' lips. \nON PHILOSOPHY AND ON THE SOVIETS \nLenin and Bogdanov announced their differences over soviets and \ntrade unions as being of secondary importance in the winter of 1905-6; \nthe overriding task was to prepare an uprising to instal a provisional \nrevolutionary government. This consensus fortified Lenin's factional \nloyalty. He, the founder of Bolshevism, knew \nscarcely any Bolshevik leader in st. In epistemology, Lenin sided with \nPlekhanov. So far, \nBogdanov and Lenin were in agreement. Bogdanov linked their outlook with \nMarxism.37 \nNevertheless Lenin and Bogdanov concurred that philosophical \ndisagreements need not affect their political alliance.3S Lenin expressed outrage when Plekhanov \ndeclared that a causal link existed between Bogdanov's 'subjectivist' \nphilosophy and his 'voluntarist' pursuit of a revolutionary dictator-\nship.39 \nLenin was of the opinion, all the same, that Bogdanov lacked the \nintellectual flexibility appropriate to the politician. Free-ranging in philosophy, Bogdanov in 1905 \nwas dogmatic about the concept of the 'vanguard party'. If the soviets \nwould not accept leadership from the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party, he implied, then too bad for the soviets. He \nwas as doctrinaire about this as any Bolshevik hardliner (even though \nsuch an attitude was not in fact a logically unavoidable conclusion to be \ndrawn from What Is To Be Done. Lenin's view, as sketched in \nNovember 1905 and elaborated in his 1906 pamphlet Victory of the \n Predicting the Tide \n145 \nKadets, was different: he wanted the soviets to act as 'the embryos of \nthe new revolutionary power' . The Petersburg Soviet should initiate the process \nby selecting representatives to announce themselves as 'the pro-\nvisional revolutionary government of all Russia' . The \nsoviet, he declared, was a 'fighting organisation for the attainment of \nspecific goals'.43 \nBut how could there be certainty that the soviets would be adequate \nto their task. Lenin's reactions tugged him in opposing directions. Lenin, \nwho had once sung the praises of the 'professional revolutionary', \nwanted to fling open the gates of the party to ordinary, inexperienced \nworkers without a smattering of Marxist doctrine: all to prod the \ncommittees out of their 'inertia' .50 \nYet Lenin simultaneously repeated that the party alone was the re-\npository of revolutionary wisdom. \nOrganisational discipline too had to be preserved; and party com-\n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmittees should ensure that their activists in the soviets toed the party \nline.52 Lenin occasionally spoke as if it was a pity that Bolsheviks had to \njoin the soviets at all.53 \nConsequently Lenin, however far he swam out towards the notion \nthat the working class was Marxist by instinct, did not toss away his \nlifebelt of traditional Bolshevism; and, though he had pragmatic \nreasons for continuing with his overtures to the Mensheviks, he still \nalso conceived of Menshevism itself as an impractical strategy. He \ncensured Akselrod, Dan and Martov even though they were the party's \nonly theorists who produced articles which prefigured the emergence \nof the soviets in late 1905.55 Whenever he read of \nsuch plans, Lenin returned to his centralist premises. Like Trotski, Lenin thought that the \n'democratic dictatorship' could be installed only by simultaneous \nprocesses of central direction and local self-organisation.56 \nFAILURE OF INSURRECTION \nIf Lenin's thinking in 1905 was more tension-laden than was custom-\nary even for him, it must be appreciated that Russian politics changed \nwith bewildering rapidity inside a few months. Lenin was an active politician, not an armchair commen-\ntator. Since Lenin was \nconcerned lest the Bolsheviks might float adrift of working-class \nopinion, it was natural for him to make a strong case for the instinctive \nvirtues of the factory labourer. \nBefore 1905 he had experienced small difficulty in communicating \npolicies to his Bolsheviks; but his editorial job in Novaya Zhizn, upon \nhis return to Russia, was in the gift of a Central Committee suspicious \nof his pro-soviet enthusiasms. Semen Shvarts \nwas then a Bolshevik agitator in the capital.58 Many Bolshevik committee-men at \nlower levels shared the Central Committee's distrust of non-party \norganisations. On 21 November 1905 there began a conference of \nparty committees in the Moscow region. Soviets should be treated \nmerely as 'the technical apparatus' for carrying the party's leadership \nto the working class. The months \nfrom October to December witnessed the entrance of Bolsheviks into \nmore mass organisations such as the trade unions and the soviets. They sought to use the soviets as a base \nfor propaganda in favour of armed insurrection. They helped in \nstrengthening the Moscow Soviet in December (which contrasted with \ntheir behaviour in St. The \nPetersburg Soviet called upon the people to withhold tax payments. \nThe Petersburg Soviet's life was ended as suddenly as it had begun.61 \nLenin's influence over events in St. The Moscow Bolsheviks, who held the party's city \ncommittee, decided to mount an insurrection before the authorities \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrepeated their attempt at suppressing revolutionary activity.62 The \nMoscow Soviet sanctioned the uprising. Petersburg and, by 17 December, the fighting \nwas over. Lenin's doubts, expressed in early autumn, had proved \nwell-founded. \nTAMPERE AND THE DUMA \nWhile insurrection took place in Moscow, a Conference of Bolsheviks \nwas being held to the north. Petersburg.66 The crisis in Moscow led to a \nbreakdown of communications between Russia and Finland. Insurrection remained the Bolshevik \npriority. They \nviewed a policy of boycott as yet another sign of the Bolsheviks' naive \ninflexibility. Lenin had dreaded this since summer. \nLenin's attitude was less rigid. Like all Bolsheviks, he denounced the \nlaw's provisions as a mockery of constitutionalism. Under the \ncover of this process, Lenin argued, it would be possible for workers to \nre-establish the soviets. He turned to Lenin for backing. Lenin \nsaid he had changed his mind.73 \nThe debate sheds light on politics inside the Bolshevik faction. The secret \nof his alleged domination over all things Bolshevik, it was asserted, lay \npartly with his ability to beguile committee-men of inadequate formal \neducation. Undoubtedly Lenin deployed his erudition to advantage. \nMen of humble social origin were legion in the Bolshevik faction. Throughout his career as a party \nboss, Lenin had to take their feelings into account. The reporter was Lenin.77 Negotiations between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks followed \nhard on the Conference. Lenin and Martov were present.78 Lenin also loyally pressed the \nBolshevik argument for boycotting the Duma. \nIronically, he made a case not dissimilar from Lenin's earlier one: that \nthe Duma elections should be exploited as an instrument for revolu-\ntionary self-organisation by the working class. Bolshevik opposition, \nhowever, was strong; and the Mensheviks, being themselves suspicious \nabout the Duma, bowed to their arguments.79 \nOver the winter of 1905-6, however, the political situation in the \ncountry became clearer. Tsarism was not on the verge of collapse. The successful candidates, \nin order of popularity, were Plekhanov, Dan and Lenin. \nLenin's report proposed land nationalisation.9o \nThe disagreement between Maslov and Lenin over agrarian policy \nreflected differing expectations about the post-tsarist Russian state.91 Lenin, as a Bolshevik, envisaged a \ndifferent scenario. Discussion \ncovered the entirety of Russian history. Russian \nfeudalism was a bastard variant.94 Lenin had challenged this view in the 1890s. Suddenly, a \ndecade later, his historiographical differences with Plekhanov were \nseen to underpin a question of enormous immediate relevance: what \nwas the nature of this tsarist state and how best could social-democrats \ndismantle it. This was that \n Predicting the Tide \n153 \nLenin, for all his agro-economic expertise, was unable to keep most \nBolsheviks with him. Suvorov, a Bolshevik who was politically and philosophically \nclose to Bogdanov, baulked at land nationalisation; instead he \nproposed a scheme which would designate all agricuituralland as the \nproperty of the peasantry. Such Bolsheviks considered it impossible to \nprevent the peasantry from appropriating whatever they wanted in the \ncountryside once the revolutionary conflagration had begun.98 Lenin \ncame some way to accommodating Suvorov's objection.99 But most Bolsheviks stayed \nwith Suvorov. And Lenin, thinking Suvorov's ideas to be incorrect but \nnot fundamentally damaging to Bolshevik strategy, voted in his \nsupport and against Maslov. Not only \ndoes it show us Lenin the practical politician under pressure to back \npolicies which were not entirely to his liking. It also reveals how, even \non a major question of policy such as land tenure, Lenin was not the \nmaster of the Bolshevik faction. And it also demonstrates, if we look \nforward a few years from 1906, that the Bolshevik disavowal of land \nnationalisation as governmental policy in October 1917 by no means \nrepresented an abrupt reversal of Bolshevik traditions.lOl Bolshevik attitudes remained under fire. Lenin's insurrectionism was said to have blinded him to \nother political opportunities. 103 This made painful listening for Lenin; \nit had been the Central Committee, not he, which had been reluctant to \nparticipate in the soviets in 1905. But Martynov's mistake also brought \nadvantages to Lenin. This was Akselrod's \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreport on the Duma.l04 Lenin led off for the Bolsheviks in reply. He retained reservations about Bolshevik policy; \nbut factional ties prevented him from stating them openly.llo \nLenin accepted the result with equanimity.lll He also \nannounced that he did not believe that Bolsheviks and Mensheviks \ncould not work together in the same party. They spoke against the \narmed robberies that the Bolsheviks had undertaken to increase their \nfaction's treasury.ll4 Lenin's support for such 'expropriations' was \nwell-known. Unlike the majority of Bolsheviks present, Lenin sided with \nthe Mensheviks. Negotiations evinced an accord to include seven Men-\nsheviks and three Bolsheviks in the Central Committee. Lenin was not \namong them. The Bolsheviks chosen were Desnitski, Krasin and \nRykov (who was to be replaced by Bogdanov upon his release from \nprison). It was possibly a signal from his factional associates that he and \nhis close supporters had moved too far away from their line of policy; \nbut they cannot have felt extremely strongly about this since he \ncontinued for the rest of 1906 to assume a leading position, alongside \nBogdanov and Krasin, in Bolshevik discussions. His energies were to be reserved for his widely-acknowledged \nspecialism: editing Bolshevik newspapers and other publications.119 \nAt any rate, the entire Bolshevik leadership was at least agreed on the \nneed to maintain an autonomous factional central apparatus inside the \nformally re-united party. A Bolshevik Centre was secretly established. \nLenin found the Congress less gratifying.", "Bolshevik_Strategy_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in 1917, were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Millions of people perished in \n67 \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after 1918, was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. Russia, encouraged by \n Ad Extirpanda \n69 \nintimations of support from Britain and France, held firm. Germany \ndeclared war on Russia. The Allies, including Russia, confronted the Central Powers. \nRussia's relations with Austria-Hungary had deteriorated over the \nprevious decade; and Germany's pretensions in both Eastern Europe \nand the Near East had intermittently heightened tension between St \nPetersburg and Berlin. \nBut the economic competition to be expected from Germany in \ntraditional Russian trading areas such as Persia remained a source of \nworry. Russian business in several key industrial sectors was also \nsuffering at the hands of German firms in the Russian domestic \nmarket. In addition, Russian foreign policy from the 1890s moved \ncloser towards the embrace of the French. Both \nRussian and French politicians opposed the expansion of German \npower in Europe. Russian fears about Germany were complemented by \nGerman fears about Russia. German army leaders advised that the \nachievements of Russian industrial development were such that, if \nGermany's security was to be guaranteed, Russian power had to be \ndestroyed by a pre-emptive war. \nBy 1914, the Russian emperor judged that his country's prestige \nand geopolitical interest in the Balkans were at stake. Russia had \npublicly given way to Austrian threats in the recent past. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. And yet he was little \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Obsessive as he was about controlling Bolshevik affairs, he \nseldom let them expunge everything else from his mind. This added to Russia's \ndifficulties, compelling her to fight simultaneously on two fronts. Yet \nGermany, facing Russia to the east and France and Britain to the \nwest, had the same problem to a greater degree. To the east, it was the Russians who temporarily held \nthe initiative. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn 1914. \n Ad Extirpanda \n71 \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. The additional danger for the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders was that, as Russian subjects, they and their \nwives might come under suspicion in Austrian-ruled Poland as being \nspies. Anti-Russian sentiment was \nrife among local Poles. Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. Bagocki was to recall that Lenin was agitated \nless by his personal situation than by the Second International \nleadership's reaction to the war. Lenin rightly stated that this implicitly \nbreached the assumptions of the Second International's anti-war \npolicy. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. '9 There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. 11 \nIt was among the socialists of the Romanov empire that hostility \nto the war was strongest and most pervasive. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war. \nPotresov and Maslov, who called for a war of national defence \nagainst German militarism, declined to lend overt support to Nikolai \nII; they would defend the country but would lend no succour to the \ngovernment. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort.16 \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn 7 August 1914 Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. 22 Adler and \nDiamand responded helpfully, declaring to the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs in Vienna that the suspected Russian spy Lenin was well-\nknown throughout Europe for his dedication to the 'struggle against \nRussian tsarism'.24 \nLenin returned to Bialy Dunajec. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 34 \nANNOUNCING A POLICY \nSettling again in Switzerland, Lenin was a leader with an even \nsmaller following than in the pre-war period. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. 37 They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. But Lenin maintained that neither the \nCentral Powers nor the Allies should be analysed so generously. 40 Its origins, \naccording to Lenin, lay in the international struggle for markets; it \nwas also an attempt to divide the international working-class \nmovement and to prevent revolution. Socialists ought to respond \nby preparing for a 'revolutionary war'.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension.42 What caused controversy was Lenin's attitude to \nRussia. Here was \nan emigre revolutionary, lacking finances, organisation and person-\nnel, declaring to his colleagues that propaganda should be directed at \ntelling the largely patriotic population in Russia to welcome the \ncountry's conquest. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either.44 \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. He \nrepeated it in 1914, but there was a significant difference in the \ncircumstances: nobody in 1904 expected the Japanese, if victorious, \nto occupy Russia. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov.46 And yet Lenin remained willing to \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland.48 The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. \nMore importantly, he ceased to advocate 'defeatism' exclusively for \nRussia. He still suggested in Social-Democrat that the Russian regime \nwas the worst of Europe's regimes and that Russia's defeat was more \ndesirable than that of any other nation. 56 Thus Lenin urged multilateral defeatism. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. For Plekhanov, Lenin had become an insane sloganeer \ninstead of a serious politician. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. Kautsky's refusal to \ncondemn Kaiser Wilhelm, according to Lenin, was as heinous as \nPlekhanov's argument in favour of Russian national self-defence. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Lenin declared his opinion frankly: 'It \nwould not be a bad thing if the Germans took Riga, Tiflis and \nHelsingfors. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. Martov and Trotski rejected any call upon \nworkers in Russia and elsewhere to work for the military defeat of \ntheir respective countries as unrealistic. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. Maslov confirmed Lenin's inclination to \nreject all thought of negotiating with the Mensheviks. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective. Published in early June 1915, it attacked the positions \nof Martov, Trotski and Kautsky.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. 79 \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. Undoubtedly there was political \ntrouble for the Russian imperial authorities, especially in St \nPetersburg, in the month before the declaration of war. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis. Lenin referred to the problem only glancingly; the \ngreater problem, in his view, was constituted by the sins of the party \nleadership.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. 88 Plekhanov was nearer to Lenin in washing his hands of the \n Ad Extirpanda \n85 \nSecond International; but Lenin could not found a Third Interna-\ntional with a Plekhanov, who stoutly defended the necessity for \nGermany to be defeated. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final.90 \nLenin denied that all organisations, regardless of political orienta-\ntion, eventually give rise to bureaucratic practices in response to the \ntechnical requirements of fast, informed and co-ordinated decision-\nmaking. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914.92 \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. In Socialism and the War \nhe made his objective explicit. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. Yet Lenin's \nhopes about Shlyapnikov were soon dashed. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. While accepting many strategical notions put forward by \nLenin, they objected to his pre-war writings on national self-\ndetermination and disliked his neglect of the peace movement. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. The war was \ndefined as imperialistic; all socialists were called upon to oppose their \ngovernments; multilateral defeatism was accepted as policy; and the \nidea that a democratic peace was achievable without revolution \nacross Europe was rejected. The Baugy Bolsheviks added an inflection \nto Luxemburg's argument which would have annoyed her. 104 \nBukharin came perilously close to repudiating the old Russian \nMarxist premise that Russia's next revolution would be a 'bour-\ngeois' one. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. 106 Bukharin, in his \nown view, simply desired a switch of the party's focus of work from a \nRussian bourgeois revolution towards a European socialist revolu-\ntion; he did not deny that the forthcoming revolution in Russia \nwould be bourgeois. Fourteen issues appeared in 1915, carrying twenty \nfour pieces by Lenin; he oversaw all stages of its production. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. In spring 1915, \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. His aim had been \nnot only to denigrate Aleksandr Bogdanov as a politician but also to \nindicate the kind of philosophy acceptable to Marxists: and \nPlekhanov's influence on Lenin's chapters had been strong. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. \nFeuerbach: all to trace Marxism to its theoretical underpinnings. 117 The fact that Lenin over-\nlooked the wartime writings of his adversaries indicates how deeply \nsubmerged he had become in his own theoretical quest. He was \nbehaving like a typical Russian revolutionary intellectual in setting \nhimself the objective of achieving a comprehensive 'world-view'; \npolitics alone was not enough. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. 126 This led Lenin to a further modification. 128 \nNone the less, Lenin also went beyond Plekhanov in 1915 by \nasserting that the validity of concepts and categories was testable \nonly by their usefulness when applied to real situations. 129 \nAn emphasis on practical experimentation was hardly new among \nRussian Marxists; it had been characteristic of Lenin's old philo-\nsophical adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, in Empiriomonism. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of 1915, when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. Lenin's self-contradictions and explorations allow an \nastute scholar to select a wide range of ideas as sources of professed \ninfluence. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him.' 143 This is reminiscent of Lenin's invocation in \nWhat Is To Be Done. He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nD.", "Bolshevik_Faction_1907": " 9 For the Good of the Cause \nON THE RETREAT \nIf political reactionaries in Russia exaggerated the efficaciousness of \nrepression, it is equally true that the country's liberals (as well as many \nsocialists) underestimated the difficulties that would be posed by the \ninception of a fully democratic order. \nBe that as it may, the clamour of Russian oppositional groups for \nelective, representative government had never been stronger than in \n1906. 2 There were only seventeen \nrepresentatives from the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, \nand only two from the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. It was disliked by Bolsheviks, including those like Lenin \nwho had been unhappy about boycotting the Duma elections in the \nfirst instance.9 \nMeanwhile the Bolshevik Centre's activity was focused on the \ntowns. The Centre's leading \nfigures were Bogdanov, Krasin and Lenin. But Lenin, unlike Bogdanov \nand Krasin, was unhappy that the Centre should remain involved in the \norganisation of military training; 12 he knew too that his two colleagues \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \nretained objections to official party policy on participation in the \nSecond State Duma. 14 \nOn the other hand it was not in his interest to drive the Mensheviks \nto break with the Bolsheviks. Lenin called for participation. The Mensheviks did Lenin's job for him. His momentary thoughts of agreements \nwith representatives of liberalism were a thing of the past; he joined all \nthe other Bolsheviks in an anti-Menshevik front. 1s Bolsheviks, though by \nno means all of them, then campaigned to get social-democrats elected \nto the Duma.16 Party work was conducted cauti-\nously; and the environment of repression began to tip the balance of \nsocial-democratic opinion in the Bolsheviks' favour, however margi-\nnally, after the closure of the First State Duma.17 Bolshevik doubts \nabout the Central Committee's higher hopes about parliamentarism \nseemed justified. And Bolsheviks were among them for the \nfirst time; eighteen of the faction's candidates secured election.21 \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in 1906-7 make a mixed impression. He was \nunmoved by Trotski's Results and Prospects, which was published in \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1906;23 he objected equally to the multi-volume studies on con-\ntemporary Russia produced by the Menshevik leadership from 1909 \nonwards.24 He also rejected the general political scenario painted in \nBogdanov's various works (although it was not until the latter half of \n1907 that Lenin engaged his rival in open disagreement at a Party \nConference). Lenin still defended the \nBolshevik refusal to participate in the First State Duma.29 Lenin's position was 'centrist' \ninside Russian social-democracy on the parliamentary question; he \ndisagreed with both Bogdanov to his 'left' and Martov to his 'right'. \nBogdanov fully expected Bolsheviks to enter a Constituent Assembly \nin Russia once a democratic republic has been established; but he \nargued that the Duma was an utterly paltry constitutional body when \ncompared with such a future Assembly or even with the existing \nReichstag. The Russian political situation, moreover, was inherently \nunstable. By \nparticipating in the Duma, Russian social-democrats would help to \n For the Good of the Cause \n161 \nlegitimate the existing political order and fail to concentrate upon \nmobilising the workers and the peasantry into armed action against the \nmonarchy.32 In reply, Lenin agreed that politics in Russia were \nsusceptible of sudden transformation; he, no less than Bogdanov, \nexpected violent political 'breaks' and 'leaps' to take place. Bogdanov, in his turn, declared that \nLenin's tactical shimmyings amounted to a sell-out of Bolshevik \nprogrammatic goals to Menshevism.3s \nLenin had often in the past referred to the' Asiatism' of Russian \npolitical life, nor did he cease to do so; but he also maintained that the \nRussian state had been greatly altered by 1905.39 This phrase was unacceptable \nto his opponents, Bolshevik and Menshevik. In terms of \nthe long-standing consensus in Russian Marxism, was his standpoint \nnot heresy. Lenin's response drew attention to two matters: German \nhistory and 'Bonapartism'.42 Premier Stoly-\npin, in Lenin's judgement, was introducing such Bonapartism to \nRussia. Virtually all \nMensheviks wanted to do this through the 'municipalisation' of \nproperty in land, most Bolsheviks through letting the peasants seize it \nfor themselves; and Lenin had his own policy of 'nationalisation'.65 All \norganised Marxists in the Russian empire were, for the first time, \nrepresented at a Party Congress. Factionalism was rife. The Bolsheviks detected questions of principle in every item \nproposed by their opponents; and they charged them with disregard \nfor the importance of 'theory' .71 Bogdanov too \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvolunteered a report, prompting Martov to surmise that his adver-\nsary's task would be to comment on the work of 'another secret \ninstitution'.72 This was a reference to the Bolshevik Centre. As \nevidence of Bolshevik duplicity, Martov noted that Bogdanov, Krasin \nand Lenin had refused to hand over to the Central Committee the sum \nof 60 000 roubles left to the party in the will of the industrialist Savva \nMorozov. The \nMenshevik Martynov jibed that, while he stood for 'permanent \nrevolution', the Bolsheviks preferred 'permanent chatter'. The Polish, Latvian and \nBundist delegations found the Bolshevik-Menshevik altercations \ntiresome. The Bolsheviks, \nhaving won only a handful of places at the Congress more than the \nMensheviks, did not command an absolute majority. Aleksinski, a deputy in \nthe Duma and also a Bolshevik, delivered a hostile co-report;77 and \nLenin dismissed Tsereteli's words as 'the purest revisionism' . \nPlekhanov stirred up further wrangling when he suggested that the \nphilosophical standpoint of Mach and Avenarius, so beloved of many \nBolsheviks, was irreconcilable with Marxism; he also asserted that \nsyndicalist ideas might soon take hold inside the Bolshevik faction.80 \nAgain the Poles and other non-Russian delegates intervened and the \nCongress was hauled forward to its third item: Lenin's report on the \nparty's 'relation to the bourgois parties' .84 \nBut the Bolsheviks obtained strong support from the Congress floor.8s \nTrotski, Luxemburg and Jogiches thought Lenin over-optimistic about \nthe scale of potential assistance from the peasantry; but the Bolsheviks \nthis time stood their ground and, after some vacillation, most Poles \nvoted for the Bolshevik motion.87 Thus the Bolsheviks recorded their \nfirst unqualified victory at the Congress.ss Speaking for the \nBolsheviks, G.s9 \nThe Mensheviks knew that the Bolsheviks would win the resultant \nvote. Why was \nit, they asked, that the Bolsheviks looked upon workers' soviets as \nnothing better than a 'necessary evil'.90 Neither \nBogdanov nor Lenin responded. Bolshevik opposition to Akselrod's \nscheme earned the Congress's approval.91 Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. On 18 May \nthe Bolsheviks finally won most of the Latvians and the Poles to their \nside. The Latvians insisted that the Bolsheviks make \nexcisions from their motion, especially the clause justifying the boycott \nof the First Duma. Thus modified, the Bolshevik motion was passed by \nCongress.92 \nDan assailed the Bolshevik leaders as wheeler-dealers: 'And it is \nimpossible by your words to paint over the fact that you were against \nparticipation in the State Duma, and now you're sitting in it' .93 On all \nsides he saw signs of Bolshevik trickery. It had been in \nnear-panic that the delegates attended to three final crucial items of \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness before returning to Russia. They were presented with a joint \nmotion on the trade unions by the Bolsheviks, the Poles and the \nLatvians. Five were Bolsheviks: I. \nRozhkov, I.1Oo The Poles \nwould be useful allies for the Bolsheviks on many issues. It was already crystal-clear that the Bolshevik faction \nwould not be able to do just as it liked in the Central Committee, no \nmore than it had in the stormy proceedings of the Congress. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party mustered \nonly nineteen places. l03 \nMost Bolshevik leaders had called for a boycott, pressing their case \nat an emergency Party Conference in the Finnish town of Kotka on 21 \nJuly. Lenin therefore held the ring between Bogdanov and Dan. l07 \nLenin's 'centrist' resolution was victorious at the Party Conference. \nAccording to Trotski's estimate, the Russian Social Democratic \nLabour Party's membership dropped from 150 000 in 1907 to 10 000 \nin 1910. \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased.125 The Bolshevik \nCentre recognised, even in 1906, the importance of acquiring a safe, \nsecret base.126 There Lenin lived \nwith Bogdanov and Krasin, and the troika had Krupskaya as their \nsecretary. \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nA contract was signed for a multi-volume edition of his works, to be \nentitled Over the Past Twelve Years .137 His intransigence was \nnot unique among Bolsheviks. But this only encour-\naged the Bolshevik Centre to persist in its kind of behaviour. The \nBolshevik leaders by contrast revelled in a machismo of personal \ninsensitivity in debate. He fretted about the Central Com-\nmittee and the Bolshevik Centre's far from secure grasp on it. Even \nsharper was his concern about Bogdanov's influence in the Bolshevik \nCentre. Lenin's anti-Kadet \nmotion won the day.142 Yet it did not reflect the attitude of all \nBolsheviks; and many boycottists, having failed to prevent the party's \nelectoral participation, soon began to think of ways to stop the \nBolshevik Duma deputies from attending the Duma. A split between \nLenin and Bogdanov was in the making. The Bolsheviks were a mere faction. \nHow could Lenin justify cleaving them into two mini-factions. Lenin declared: 'Indi-\nvidual parties can hide in the underground, give no sign of themselves, \ndisappear from the political centre-stage; but, at the slightest revivifi-\ncation, the basic political forces will again reveal themselves, perhaps \nin altered form but with the same character and direction of activity, \nuntil the objective problems of a revolution which has suffered this or \nthat defeat have been resolved. In 1907 Lenin was not ready to break with Bogdanov. A watch \nwas placed on Lenin's movements on 14 November. Lenin became a fugitive. On 12 December 1907 Lenin \njoined the steamer bound for Stockholm; on 21 December, joined at \nlast by Krupskaya, he left Sweden for his second period of emigration \nin Western Europe.", "Bolshevik_Faction_1922": " Prominent Bolsheviks were not \nunusual in trying to hide away the altercations among themselves. Most \npeople knew next to nothing about the Bolshevik wrangling about the \nNew Economic Policy; and the rumours about dissension in the party, \nwhich had came to the ears of those observers with friends in the \nparty's higher echelons, were dying down. And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. There were rows about foreign trade, about state \nbureaucracy, about the Soviet constitution, about party administration \nand even about the division of responsibilities among these same \ncolleagues. \nBolshevik leaders, including Lenin, were irked that a retreat from \nsupposedly socialist policies had been forced upon them. Not only Lenin and Trotski but also the rest \nof the Politburo peppered their public statements with references to the \nFrench Revolution and its eventual retreat from ideological radicalism. \nThe possibility that the New Economic Policy might initiate a counter-\nrevolution from within was in their thoughts and was sustained by the \nstridency of attacks made by non-Bolshevik Russians in emigration \nwho predicted this very denouement.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. The novelty was that Lenin now urged that Rykov and \nTsyurupa should use the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (or \nRabkrin) as their main administrative apparatus of supervision.21 \nThe sole full member of the Politburo to approve Lenin's scheme was \nKamenev. The scheme proposed \nby him was carefully limited to the matter of his Sovnarkom deputies \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand their functions. The Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic's most \nreluctant f.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke. The various trade treaties obtained by the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic were encouraging; but the unilateral \nabrogation of the debts contracted by Nikolai II and the Provisional \nGovernment had inhibited potential investment. \nSeveral leading Bolsheviks began to argue that the business of \nimports and exports therefore be partially denationalised.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation.49 Lenin's summer \nconvalescence gave the proponents of denationalisation their chance. 5\u00b0 If Lenin and Trotski \nhad trusted each other better, things might have been different. Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski. After \nconsulting the other members, he announced the postponement \nrequested by Lenin.s9 \nActive supporters of Lenin in the party leadership's front rank were \nfew. \nLenin had turned the tables on them.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress.86 In any case, bad blood had not come \nbetween Lenin and Stalin; as yet their disputes had been kept within the \nbounds of a party which thrived on polemics. He was already a Politburo member (whereas \n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMolotov had only even become a candidate member when selected as \n'responsible secretary').90 At \nthe plenum of the Central Committee it was Lenin who intervened to \nput minds at rest.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time.94 Lenin on this occasion was \nignored by his colleagues. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. Lenin and Martov had belonged to \nthe same St Petersburg Marxist organisation in the 1890s; they had \nfounded the newspaper Iskra together in the emigration in 1900. \nSubsequently they had fallen out: Lenin the Bolshevik struggled \nagainst Martov the Menshevik.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. Their past disagreements had once provoked \nTrotski to shout at Lenin that he was a 'hooligan' at a Politburo \nmeeting. The October Revolution and the \nCivil War had brought them together, and Lenin was inviting Trotski \nto resume close collaboration. A \nCongress of Soviets was due to be held in late December, and its \nproceedings were expected to define the relations between Russia and \nthe other Bolshevik-led republics of the former Russian empire. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. \nLenin still desired a multi-republican federation wherein the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic was a constituent republic alongside \nthe other Soviet republics; Stalin continued to call for the other Soviet \nrepublics simply to be pulled into the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet \nRepublic with rights of regional autonomy. Tensions \nbetween Moscow and the non-Russian republics increased in 1921-\n1922, with Ukraine and Georgia being especially annoyed by the \nprovisions of the treaties they had signed with the RSFSR. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. The Georgian Bolsheviks \nstrenuously objected to Stalin's proposal that the Georgian republic \nshould be incorporated in a Transcaucasian Federation (which in turn \nwould enter the RSFSR). Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 117 A \nregional federal authority should be able to forestall inter-republican \nstrife; and, much as the Georgian Bolshevik leaders felt done down by \nthis, they had not always shown attitudes typical of socialist \ninternationalism. The Georgian Bolsheviks had even \nwished to introduce a law on citizenship which would discriminate \nheavily against the several non-Georgian minorities in the republic. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. 119 \nWhere the Georgian Bolsheviks failed, however, the party leadership \nin Ukraine had some success. On 16 May, they voted to bypass Moscow and contact all \nthe other republics about relations with the RSFSR. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. Lenin's guard was lowered by a \nnumber of factors. \nAfter the Russo-Ukrainian flurry and Lenin's stroke the question \nwas again pushed into the background. Only on 10 August, weeks \nbefore Lenin returned to work in the Kremlin, did the Politburo \ninstruct the Orgburo to 'prepare the question of the interrelationships \nbetween the RSFSR and the independent republics'. 125 \nThe Orgburo met on II August and set up a commission consisting \nof a representative from each of the republics as well as the following \ncentrally-based leaders: Stalin, V. In addition, all matters of finance, trade, industry, \nsecurity, transport, communications, food supplies and military \norganisation would be handled directly by the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic; and no national appellation other than the \nword 'Russian' was to appear in the union's title. 133 The Armenian Central Committee took \nthe same line five days later; and on 16 September the party's \nTranscaucasian Regional Committee confirmed this on behalf of \nBolsheviks in Armenia, Azerbaidzhan and Georgia. 136 \nEven the Armenian party was less than ecstatic about Stalin's \nproposals, asking that the republics should explicitly be accorded \n'broad autonomy' within the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic \nand that time should be set aside to prepare the population for what \nwas to happen. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'. 139 \nThere was a tacit reluctance among local Bolsheviks to accept the \nstatus of mere 'autonomous republics' for their territories. They did not \nwant to ape the model of the Bashkir Republic within the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. \nPetrovski from the Ukraine was similarly unhappy, and Armenia's \nrepresentative Lukashin was disconcerted by Stalin's brusqueness \nabout the rights of the republics in the future federal order. The new federation was to be called \nthe Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia and not the Russian \n Testament to a Revolution \n279 \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. Indeed the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic would join it as one of the several constituent \nrepublics, and a set of new supreme organs of power would need to be \nestablished. He and his supporters in the \ncommission wrote to Central Committee recommending the formation \nof a Union as demanded by Lenin - and they proposed the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics as the title. Lenin would see to that.'150 By this he meant not \nonly Russians in his party who overlooked the wishes of the non-\nRussians in the general population but also non-Russian Bolsheviks \nwho were similarly insensitive. \nThe members included Stalin, Kamenev, Pyatakov, Rykov, Chicherin \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Kalinin as well as representatives from each of the non-Russian \nrepublics. When \nLenin returned to chair Sovnarkom on 3 October, an agreement held \namong its members to avoid controversy lest he become agitated. (In \nfact he became a lot more agitated because of this plot of gentility \nagainst himl)155 Stalin also knew that the Georgian Bolshevik leaders' \nhostility to being included in a Transcaucasian federation still cut no \nice with Lenin. 157 At a meeting of the Transcaucasian \nRegional Committee of the Bolshevik party, Ordzhonikidze referred to \nthem as 'chauvinistic filth' . \nOrdzhonikidze delightedly complied, referring to the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition as a 'Menshevik deviation' . 163 In vain did the resigners \nwrite to Lenin protesting the justice of their cause. And Stalin showed his guile by acceding to the demand of the \nGeorgian Bolshevik dissenters for an investigative mission to be sent to \nTbilisi. The dissentient Georgian Bolsheviks nervously \nawaited their fate. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests.172 Lenin was appalled. The opening \nwords were portentous: 'Evidently I am deeply guilty before the \nworkers of Russia inasmuch as I failed to intervene with sufficient \nvigour and sufficent sharpness in the notorious question of \n\"autonomisation\", officially designated, it seems, as the question of \nthe union of soviet socialist republics.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. 177 This was ratified at a Congress of Soviets of the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. The Georgian Bolsheviks had \nbeen defeated. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. The Bolshevik \nparty leadership had been casual in drafting legislation; they were \nactivists and wanted action, not fine laws which could never be broken. His main worry was the \ndurability of the party's rule over society in a world of states hostile to \nthe Soviet republic. Trotski was the renowned co-instigator \nof the October Revolution, Zinoviev headed the Executive Committee \nof the Communist International and Kamenev was chairman of the \nMoscow Soviet. 182 Lenin's perspicaciousness was dipping here. \nRykov and Tsyurupa, who had figured in his planning for the re-\norganisation of the governmental machinery, were rightly excluded \nfrom the list even though they were prominent politicians with much \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncurrent power. Few \nBolsheviks outside the Politburo membership would have judged him \nto be any more worthy of inclusion than Pyatakov. Stalin, moreover, was thought to lack \ncompetence as a theorist - a major failing in a Bolshevik leader of that \nepoch. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. A party split, he asserted, was the greatest threat to the \nsurvival of the Soviet republic. 183 \nNone of the six colleagues came out well from Lenin's comments. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin.' 189 \nThis cumbersome remark was meant to indicate that Trotski and \nStalin might eventually find themselves on opposing sides in a dispute \nabout the rival claims on the party's favour on behalf of the working \nclass and the peasants.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. The alienation of most workers from \nthe party was already a commonplace of Bolshevik thought, and nearly \nall peasants were either too exhausted or too ignorant to take the \nSoviet regime seriously. Lenin's bipartite summary of the party's \ndependence on the two classes, furthermore, omitted to mention its \nreliance on the sprawling administrative stratum in order to maintain \nits own 'stability'. Lenin reeked nought of this. \nThe struggle over foreign-trade policy continued to exercise the minds \nof the Bolshevik leaders. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.215 It was Volodicheva \nwho took down the six thumbnail sketches of Bolshevik leaders. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command. In their later lives they were wiJiing \npolitical handmaidens unto Stalin; and there is definite evidence that at \nleast Glyasser took an anti-Trotski position in the controversies of \n1923.", "Capitalist_Development_1907": "21 \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in 1906-7 make a mixed impression. Until 1905 \ntheir main aim had been to demonstrate that, however unmodern its \ngeneral appearance, the Russian economy had decisively embarked \nupon a course of capitalist development.3s Lenin's own Development of Capitalism in Russia implied \nagreement with this. Feudal 'vestiges' had to be destroyed if capitalism \nwas to mature. Indeed it was in 1907 that he at last conceded that his early \nwritings had exaggerated the level of Russian capitalist development; \nand that feudalistic practices were stronger than he had once \nimagined. \nPerhaps his opponents were more interested in the fact that he still \nmaintained that the general direction of change as described in The \nDevelopment of Capitalism was correct. Maslov contended that the analysis \nof capitalist development offered by writers like Tugan-Baranovski \nwas fundamentally flawed. \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased.", "Capitalist_Development_1890": " \nThe analysis of capitalism was especially attractive. Marx had \ndescribed in Das Kapital how industrialists, introducing new forms of \nmachinery and a new division of labour into their factories, had \ninaugurated transformations of epochal significance. Capitalism \nenormously expanded the production of goods.3o \nUnlike the narodniki, Ulyanov condoned capitalist development. Capitalism operated upon principles of competition: \nthe capitalist maintained his business by hiring labourers to work in his \nfactory, to maximise his competitiveness he was obliged not only to \nextract as much labour power as possible from his work-force but also \nto invest an increasing proportion of his revenue in the acquisition of \nthe latest types of equipment.33 Inexorably some capitalists would be \nmore successful than others. \nOnly when the working-class dictatorship had swept away all remnants \nof the capitalist system would a more relaxed regime be initiated. Kapital and Anti-Diihring \npostulated that inherent laws governed the workings of a socio-\neconomic formation such as capitalism. Feudalism gave way \nto capitalism. And capitalism would be supplanted, ultimately, by \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncommunism.46 \nIt has been pointed out that Marx allowed for a variety of routes of \nsocial development in the epochs prior to socialism; and that he used \nthe concept of 'Asiatic despotism' rather than 'feudalism' to designate \na number of societies in the East. He affirmed that once \nthe Russian economy had embarked upon the capitalist road of \ndevelopment there would be no means of preventing capitalism from \ntaking a hold; and he felt in any case that a commune-based revolution \nin Russia would fail without aid from revolutions in industrially-\nadvanced countries elsewhere. The Marxist N. Perhaps it was only in 1892, when \nEngels at last declared that capitalism had decisively gripped the \nRussian economy,67 that the coolness towards the experiments in \nRussian Marxism fully vanished.68 According to Plekhanov, the next stage in the \ncountry's political transformation would be not an agrarian-socialist \ngovernment but a government representing the interests of the rising \nbourgeoisie. His \ntwo early books were a crucial contribution to the Russian Marxist \ndoctrine that capitalism was on the verge of pervading all economic \nrelations in town and countryside. Plekhanov drew atten-\ntion to The Communist Manifesto; he pointed out that Germany, at the \ntime of its publication in 1848, had been at a level of economic and \npolitical development comparable with Russia's in the 1880s. Even Russian economic backwardness was to be \nregarded as an asset: it would mean that socialist ideas could be \ndisseminated among Russia's working class at an earlier stage in the \ncountry's economic transformation than had been possible in Britain, \nFrance or Germany.78 His Group felt that such a programme \nwould provide the political and economic framework necessary for the \nmaturation of Russian capitalism.81 His capitalism was not going to be of an \nuntrammelled variety. It is equally \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvisible in his treatment of the subsequent measures for the eventual \ndismemberment of capitalism itself. \nCould it be that in 1890 and 1891 he detected the inadequacies in \nagrarian-socialist views without yet embracing a Russian Marxist \nperspective. His encounter with economic management was brief. Plekhanov's \neconomics were a sketch of trends.", "Capitalist_Development_1895": " PETERSBURG \nIndustrialisation poses problems everywhere it is attempted; and not \nthe least of them is the question about the political place of the \nworkers. In October 1893 G. What business, they \nasked, had a Marxist revolutionary to talk with those self-proclaimed \nfollowers of Marx like Struve who seemed to have an aversion to the \nvery goal of socialist revolution. Working on developmental economic theory, he invented \na series of mathematical schemata to represent the interrelationship of \ncapital and labour in an industrialising society. Ulyanov \ndisagreed about details in their depiction of the pattern of capitalism's \ngrowth;20 but he evidently derived intellectual benefit and perhaps also \n Arrivals \n53 \na degree of psychological support from his discussions with Struve, \nTugan and Bulgakov. He expected capitalism to give way to socialism not \nthrough bloody upheaval but as the result of peaceful, transitional \nmeasures. But how could a \n'bourgeois state' be made to inaugurate a programme for the death of \ncapitalism. In general, moreover, Struve made no \ndirect criticism of capitalism itself. He noted Marx's suggestion that a \nsocialist transformation of society would begin to be politically feasible \nonly when the capitalist economy faced crisis and ruin. He emphasised \ncapitalism's progressive role. In the late 1890s Struve and Tugan-Baranovski would \nargue that many fundamental ideas of Marx and Engels were wrong. \nStruve would reject Marx's labour theory of value as being simplistic; \nTugan would assert that recent empirical data undermined the \ncredibility of Marx's predictions about the rate of return of investment \nunder capitalism.24 \nYet Plekhanov desisted from waging war upon Struve and company \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin 1894.55 Marxists in St. The main goal of \nPlekhanov, in his project's agrarian section, had been to facilitate \ncapitalist development by abolishing both redemption payments and \ncompulsory commune membership.", "Capitalist_Development_1899": " 4 \nCapitalism in One \nCountry \n'THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA' \nSocialist scholar-politicians had become notable figures in Russian \npublic life by the turn of the century. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia. Subsequent generations \nwould often regard The Development of Capitalism as a comprehen-\nsive textbook on the country's economic transformation in modern \ntimes. It was a nostrum of \nPlekhanov, Struve, Tugan and Ulyanov that capitalist development \nwould not be impeded by the expropriation of the mass of the \npeasantry. Rather it was the provider of an essential and basic \ndomestic market for capitalist goods. His general presentation of \neconomic development resembles a picture of an ecological chain.s \nThe Development o/Capitalism offered a picture of steady, irrevers-\nible change. Capitalism, according to Ulyanov, still confronted an epoch \nof maturation but Russia was already a capitalist country. He \nwas particularly vague about what he meant by capitalism; the nearest \nhe came towards a verbal formulation was his comment that 'the \ndegree of the domestic market's development is the degree of \ncapitalism's development in a country' . The charge was that The \nDevelopment of Capitalism assumed the existence of an economy \nwhose various sectors and sub-sectors operated in harmony with each \nother. The growth of capitalism, Ulyanov emphasised, \ninevitably caused unrest among the ever more numerous body of the \nworking class. Workers would always need to consume more than the \ncapitalist system could permit. Tugan was centring upon the \ntechnical perfectibility of capitalism, Lenin upon the revolutionising \neffects of capitalism's growth. It was Skvortsov's \ncontention that a national market in grain had existed long before the \nadvent of capitalism; and that Ulyanov's account of nineteenth-\ncentury phenomena failed to show why they should be defined as \nspecifically capitalist. The \nDevelopment of Capitalism, in their opinion, was excessively taken up \nwith macro-economics. Differences of wealth among the \npeasantry were a centuries-old phenomenon and were not exclusively \na sign of capitalist development.25 \nAnd so The Development of Capitalism is a work of great weak-\nnesses and great strengths. His analysis of the process of industrialisation also has lasting \nvalue; he was especially effective in showing the significance of rural \nhandicraft production for the consolidation of capitalist relationships. 28 \nThe precise path of his approach to the intellectual formulations of \nThe Development of Capitalism will, for want of the requisite personal \ndetails, always remain mysterious. Capitalism had yet to mature \nin Russia.3s Mildly remonstrating with Plekhanov and Akselrod, he \nsought the inclusion of paragraphs describing the course of capitalist \ndevelopment in their country. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order. \n Capitalism in One Country \n77 \nAGAINST 'ECONOMISM' \nIn his Shushenskoe writings he had sketched a party programme and a \nplan of party organisation.61 This to Plekhanov appeared a betrayal \n Capitalism in One Country \n79 \nof Marxism.66 Struve in 1899 still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action.", "Landed_Gentry_1907": " While \nfostering the emergence of a group of small-holding farmers from the \nranks of the peasantry, he simultaneously protected the landed gentry \nby refusing to expropriate their land and by consequently ensuring that \nmany peasant households still had to buy or rent land to subsist.

The largest Duma fraction \nwas constituted by 161 Kadets. Nikolai II, \nresuming his earlier posture, dissolved the First Duma on 9 July. The electoral campaign to the Second \nState Duma was set to occur in the coming winter; the Duma itself \nwould convene in February 1907. Nevertheless the electoral battle for the Second \nDuma had yet to be fought.1s \nThe Second State Duma, meeting in February 1907, was somewhat \ndissimilar from its predecessor.91 Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. 101 He also announced that the government, would convoke \na Third State Duma only after altering the electoral rules. The Third State Duma convened on 1 November 1907. \nThe Octobrists in 1908 prevailed upon Stolypin to concede power to \nthe Duma to vet affairs in the imperial navy. l3l There is even a story \nthat he contemplated standing as social-democratic candidate for the \nState Duma. A Party \nConference, attended by twenty seven delegates, was held between 5 \nand 12 November in Helsinki to discuss how the social-democratic \ndeputies should operate in the Third State Duma. But it also must be \nappreciated that the State Duma, for him, posed the central immediate \nquestion for Russian social-democracy.", "Bolshevik_Leaders_1907": " \nBe that as it may, the clamour of Russian oppositional groups for \nelective, representative government had never been stronger than in \n1906. 2 There were only seventeen \nrepresentatives from the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, \nand only two from the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. It was disliked by Bolsheviks, including those like Lenin \nwho had been unhappy about boycotting the Duma elections in the \nfirst instance.6 \nAs Lenin had feared, Stolypin's reaction was fierce and effective.9 \nMeanwhile the Bolshevik Centre's activity was focused on the \ntowns. The Centre's leading \nfigures were Bogdanov, Krasin and Lenin. But Lenin, unlike Bogdanov \nand Krasin, was unhappy that the Centre should remain involved in the \norganisation of military training; 12 he knew too that his two colleagues \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \nretained objections to official party policy on participation in the \nSecond State Duma. 14 \nOn the other hand it was not in his interest to drive the Mensheviks \nto break with the Bolsheviks. Lenin called for participation. The Mensheviks did Lenin's job for him. Lenin's reaction was the same as \nthat of Bogdanov and Krasin. His momentary thoughts of agreements \nwith representatives of liberalism were a thing of the past; he joined all \nthe other Bolsheviks in an anti-Menshevik front. 1s Bolsheviks, though by \nno means all of them, then campaigned to get social-democrats elected \nto the Duma.16 Party work was conducted cauti-\nously; and the environment of repression began to tip the balance of \nsocial-democratic opinion in the Bolsheviks' favour, however margi-\nnally, after the closure of the First State Duma.17 Bolshevik doubts \nabout the Central Committee's higher hopes about parliamentarism \nseemed justified. And Bolsheviks were among them for the \nfirst time; eighteen of the faction's candidates secured election.21 \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in 1906-7 make a mixed impression. The charge that he was a \ncrypto-populist faded somewhat, if not completely; and it is difficult to \naccept many later scholars' judgement that the entirety of his work was \nessentially traditional Russian revolutionism without connection with \nMarxism. \nHis themes were the current concerns of Russian social-democratic \ndebate. He was \nunmoved by Trotski's Results and Prospects, which was published in \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1906;23 he objected equally to the multi-volume studies on con-\ntemporary Russia produced by the Menshevik leadership from 1909 \nonwards.24 He also rejected the general political scenario painted in \nBogdanov's various works (although it was not until the latter half of \n1907 that Lenin engaged his rival in open disagreement at a Party \nConference). Lenin still defended the \nBolshevik refusal to participate in the First State Duma.29 Lenin's position was 'centrist' \ninside Russian social-democracy on the parliamentary question; he \ndisagreed with both Bogdanov to his 'left' and Martov to his 'right'.30 \nIn fact Bogdanov's views were distorted in Lenin's presentation. The Russian political situation, moreover, was inherently \nunstable. By \nparticipating in the Duma, Russian social-democrats would help to \n For the Good of the Cause \n161 \nlegitimate the existing political order and fail to concentrate upon \nmobilising the workers and the peasantry into armed action against the \nmonarchy.32 In reply, Lenin agreed that politics in Russia were \nsusceptible of sudden transformation; he, no less than Bogdanov, \nexpected violent political 'breaks' and 'leaps' to take place. Bogdanov, in his turn, declared that \nLenin's tactical shimmyings amounted to a sell-out of Bolshevik \nprogrammatic goals to Menshevism.34 Lenin retorted that he was no \nMenshevik. Along with other social-democratic \ntheorists, Lenin had written little specifically about the autocracy. Until 1905 \ntheir main aim had been to demonstrate that, however unmodern its \ngeneral appearance, the Russian economy had decisively embarked \nupon a course of capitalist development. Trotski, like most other social-democratic \nwriters (ranging from Bogdanov on one side through to Martynov and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMaslov on the other), emphasised how little the position of the \nmonarchy had been changed by the post-1905 'constitutional' \nreforms; the political edifice was basically unaltered.3s \nLenin had often in the past referred to the' Asiatism' of Russian \npolitical life, nor did he cease to do so; but he also maintained that the \nRussian state had been greatly altered by 1905.39 This phrase was unacceptable \nto his opponents, Bolshevik and Menshevik. In terms of \nthe long-standing consensus in Russian Marxism, was his standpoint \nnot heresy. Lenin's response drew attention to two matters: German \nhistory and 'Bonapartism'.42 Premier Stoly-\npin, in Lenin's judgement, was introducing such Bonapartism to \nRussia.43 \nLenin's approach shows him not to have been strait-jacketed by the \nprejudices of his colleagues.44 \nThis uncustomary tentativeness may well have stemmed from prob-\n For the Good of the Cause \n163 \nlems of reconciling his view of the post-1905 Russian state with his \nobservations on trends in the peasant economy. Virtually all \nMensheviks wanted to do this through the 'municipalisation' of \nproperty in land, most Bolsheviks through letting the peasants seize it \nfor themselves; and Lenin had his own policy of 'nationalisation'.51 \nIf there was going to be such a challenge, Lenin was the likeliest \nperson to make it. At the very best it would require 'decades and decades'; \nand Lenin remained convinced that a revolutionary political crisis \ncould re-emerge at any time. Indeed it was in 1907 that he at last conceded that his early \nwritings had exaggerated the level of Russian capitalist development; \nand that feudalistic practices were stronger than he had once \nimagined. Lenin held \nfast to his original position.65 All \norganised Marxists in the Russian empire were, for the first time, \nrepresented at a Party Congress. The Bolsheviks detected questions of principle in every item \nproposed by their opponents; and they charged them with disregard \nfor the importance of 'theory' . Lenin, through tactical astuteness, got as much as \nhe could reasonably have hoped for.71 Bogdanov too \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvolunteered a report, prompting Martov to surmise that his adver-\nsary's task would be to comment on the work of 'another secret \ninstitution'.72 This was a reference to the Bolshevik Centre. As \nevidence of Bolshevik duplicity, Martov noted that Bogdanov, Krasin \nand Lenin had refused to hand over to the Central Committee the sum \nof 60 000 roubles left to the party in the will of the industrialist Savva \nMorozov. The \nMenshevik Martynov jibed that, while he stood for 'permanent \nrevolution', the Bolsheviks preferred 'permanent chatter'. The Polish, Latvian and \nBundist delegations found the Bolshevik-Menshevik altercations \ntiresome. The Bolsheviks, \nhaving won only a handful of places at the Congress more than the \nMensheviks, did not command an absolute majority. Aleksinski, a deputy in \nthe Duma and also a Bolshevik, delivered a hostile co-report;77 and \nLenin dismissed Tsereteli's words as 'the purest revisionism' . \nPlekhanov stirred up further wrangling when he suggested that the \nphilosophical standpoint of Mach and Avenarius, so beloved of many \nBolsheviks, was irreconcilable with Marxism; he also asserted that \nsyndicalist ideas might soon take hold inside the Bolshevik faction.80 \nAgain the Poles and other non-Russian delegates intervened and the \nCongress was hauled forward to its third item: Lenin's report on the \nparty's 'relation to the bourgois parties' .84 \nBut the Bolsheviks obtained strong support from the Congress floor.8s \nTrotski, Luxemburg and Jogiches thought Lenin over-optimistic about \nthe scale of potential assistance from the peasantry; but the Bolsheviks \nthis time stood their ground and, after some vacillation, most Poles \nvoted for the Bolshevik motion.87 Thus the Bolsheviks recorded their \nfirst unqualified victory at the Congress.ss Speaking for the \nBolsheviks, G.s9 \nThe Mensheviks knew that the Bolsheviks would win the resultant \nvote. Why was \nit, they asked, that the Bolsheviks looked upon workers' soviets as \nnothing better than a 'necessary evil'.90 Neither \nBogdanov nor Lenin responded. Bolshevik opposition to Akselrod's \nscheme earned the Congress's approval.91 Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. On 18 May \nthe Bolsheviks finally won most of the Latvians and the Poles to their \nside. The Latvians insisted that the Bolsheviks make \nexcisions from their motion, especially the clause justifying the boycott \nof the First Duma. Thus modified, the Bolshevik motion was passed by \nCongress.92 \nDan assailed the Bolshevik leaders as wheeler-dealers: 'And it is \nimpossible by your words to paint over the fact that you were against \nparticipation in the State Duma, and now you're sitting in it' .93 On all \nsides he saw signs of Bolshevik trickery. It had been in \nnear-panic that the delegates attended to three final crucial items of \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness before returning to Russia. They were presented with a joint \nmotion on the trade unions by the Bolsheviks, the Poles and the \nLatvians. Five were Bolsheviks: I. \nRozhkov, I.1Oo The Poles \nwould be useful allies for the Bolsheviks on many issues. It was already crystal-clear that the Bolshevik faction \nwould not be able to do just as it liked in the Central Committee, no \nmore than it had in the stormy proceedings of the Congress. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party mustered \nonly nineteen places. l03 \nMost Bolshevik leaders had called for a boycott, pressing their case \nat an emergency Party Conference in the Finnish town of Kotka on 21 \nJuly. Lenin therefore held the ring between Bogdanov and Dan. l07 \nLenin's 'centrist' resolution was victorious at the Party Conference. \nAccording to Trotski's estimate, the Russian Social Democratic \nLabour Party's membership dropped from 150 000 in 1907 to 10 000 \nin 1910. \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased. Throughout 1906, Lenin had \navoided exposing himself to the danger of arrest;123 and his caution was \nstrengthened when the Second Duma was suspended in June 1907.125 The Bolshevik \nCentre recognised, even in 1906, the importance of acquiring a safe, \nsecret base.126 There Lenin lived \nwith Bogdanov and Krasin, and the troika had Krupskaya as their \nsecretary. Both Bogdanov and Lenin \nhad been elected as its candidate members at the Fifth Party Congress, \nand they encouraged their colleagues to come out to their hideaway on \nfrequent visits.129 While in Finland, Lenin lived under \nthe pseudonym of Ervin Veikov. \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nA contract was signed for a multi-volume edition of his works, to be \nentitled Over the Past Twelve Years . It strengthens the impression that Lenin now thought \nof himself as a permanent body in the Russian political firmament.137 His intransigence was \nnot unique among Bolsheviks. But this only encour-\naged the Bolshevik Centre to persist in its kind of behaviour. The \nBolshevik leaders by contrast revelled in a machismo of personal \ninsensitivity in debate. 'I \nheard Lenin', wrote a girl about a conference of St. He fretted about the Central Com-\nmittee and the Bolshevik Centre's far from secure grasp on it. Even \nsharper was his concern about Bogdanov's influence in the Bolshevik \nCentre.140 \nIn 1907 Lenin minimised personal reference to Bogdanov both in his \nwritings and, apparently, in his speeches; he attacked policies, not \npersonalities. Lenin's anti-Kadet \nmotion won the day.142 Yet it did not reflect the attitude of all \nBolsheviks; and many boycottists, having failed to prevent the party's \nelectoral participation, soon began to think of ways to stop the \nBolshevik Duma deputies from attending the Duma. A split between \nLenin and Bogdanov was in the making. The Bolsheviks were a mere faction. \nHow could Lenin justify cleaving them into two mini-factions. It \nwould be fruitless to deny that Lenin had a factitious trait in his \ncharacter; or that he was not un attracted by the notion of being \nking-pin in the organisations to which he belonged. Lenin declared: 'Indi-\nvidual parties can hide in the underground, give no sign of themselves, \ndisappear from the political centre-stage; but, at the slightest revivifi-\ncation, the basic political forces will again reveal themselves, perhaps \nin altered form but with the same character and direction of activity, \nuntil the objective problems of a revolution which has suffered this or \nthat defeat have been resolved.' 144 \nSuch thoughts yielded the conclusion that revolutionary leadership \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin times of unfreedom was better undertaken by a few men with correct \ntheory than by many who united around a hotchpotch of incorrect \nideas. In 1907 Lenin was not ready to break with Bogdanov. Petersburg authorities were given \nclues about Lenin's whereabouts by police agents in Paris. A watch \nwas placed on Lenin's movements on 14 November. Official orders \nwere given to suspend publication of his collected works, and it looked \nmost unlikely that the Bolsheviks would succeed in putting out a party \nnewspaper legally. Lenin became a fugitive. On 12 December 1907 Lenin \njoined the steamer bound for Stockholm; on 21 December, joined at \nlast by Krupskaya, he left Sweden for his second period of emigration \nin Western Europe.", "Bolshevik_Leaders_1913": " Russian revolutionaries attracted little \nattention from the authorities. Swiss \norderliness could grate upon the sensibilities of Russians (although \nthis was never Lenin's reaction. Enquiries were made \nabout prices and passport regulations, and about the intensity of the \nlocal police's interest in Russian revolutionaries. 3 \nAnd yet Lenin and Krupskaya were still considering spending \nsummer 1912 in Geneva prior to any firm decision on their long-term \nresidence. It was \npossible to receive Russian newspapers within three days, and easier \nto contribute to and collaborate with the editors of the legal \nBolshevik press. 7 Krupskaya was to recall that Lenin was drawn to \nGalicia especially by his wish to influence the affairs of the factional \ndaily newspaper, Pravda, which had at last been issued in the capital \non 22 April 1912 under N. 8 An announcement \nthat a daily would be appearing had been made by the St Petersburg \nBolsheviks on 15 January (while the Prague Conference was taking \nplace);9 and the Prague delegates had supported schemes for an \nintensification of efforts in the legal press. Perhaps, too, police agents were right that Lenin \nwas already looking forward to the working of the Fourth State \nDuma. Again, it was easier to co-operate with Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies from Krakow than from Geneva or Paris. \nBut Lenin may have had little choice. The Prague Conference had \nordered that increased emphasis and resources be devoted to party \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nactivity in Russia. Lenin's letter to Gorki specified that the Central \nCommittee subsequently set up a Foreign Bureau in Galicia, 12 and \nthis could signify that he had moved under some pressure. Be that as \nit may, Lenin came to feel glad about the transfer. The opportunity \nfor mountain-walking in the Tatras; the similarities of everyday life \nto conditions in the Russian empire; the physical separation from the \natmosphere of internecine factional struggle in France and Switzer-\nland, which took its toll on Lenin despite his relish for it; and the \ngreater chances for Russia-based Bolsheviks to travel out to meet \nhim: all these factors contributed to a feeling that the Galician \nsojourn was only 'a semi-emigration'. Lenin continued to contribute; but the main work was \nentrusted to L. 14 In the year before moving \nto Galicia Lenin was contributing fewer articles to the Workers' \nNewspaper and Social-Democrat than to the Russia-based newspaper \nThe Star and the new periodical Enlightenment. 15 Nor were he and \nother emigre Bolsheviks alone in re-orientating their literary en-\ndeavours.17 The motivations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are \nuncertain; but perhaps the fact that no Bolshevik had up to then \nbeen similarly treated indicates that the Okhrana wanted to boost the \nmore moderate forces of Marxism in an attempt to check the growing \nradicalism of the workers' movement. In March 1913, \n Storms Before the Storm \n37 \nLenin opted for a house near the summer resort village of Zakopane, \nwhich lay close by the town railway station of Poronin and a hundred \nkilometres from Krakow.21 \nThe Bolsheviks were not the only anti-Romanov revolutionaries in \nthe area. Josef \nPilsudski, the future vanquisher of the Red Army in the Soviet-\nPolish war in 1920 and dominant Polish politician in the inter-war \nperiod, led a faction which controlled the party's Combat Organisa-\ntion. He had taken a group of activists into the Russian empire in \n1908 and robbed a train carrying 200,000 roubles. 22 Pilsudski was \nalready more nationalist than socialist, and Lenin preferred to talk \nmainly to the left-wing elements who had left the Polish Socialist \nParty to form the PPS-Lewica. That their private contacts were \ncloser is probable, since Zinoviev subsequently suggested that \nPilsudski's men helped the Bolsheviks with their security precau-\ntions. In addition, Pilsudski had been sentenced to exile in \nconnection with the 1886 conspiracy of Lenin's elder brother \nAleksandr to assassinate the Russian emperor. 23 \nThus the emigre Bolshevik leadership was not the exclusive source \nof concern for the Romanovs in Galicia. Indeed, it was Pilsudski, not \nLenin, whose extradition was requested by the St Petersburg \nauthorities.Z4 It was Pilsudski's military units which exercised in \nthe streets and fields around Zakopane;25 and Lenin, always being \nalert to the practical requirements of armed revolution, cannot have \nfailed to have been impressed by Pilsudski's project to twin \nrevolutionism with nationalism. It is not too fanciful to suppose \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat the Galician sojourn greatly reinforced Lenin's feeling that \nRussian social-democrats should take the 'national question' in the \nRomanov empire more seriously. \nLenin, however, did not confine himself to Galicia. The elections \nto the Fourth State Duma had resulted in victory for six Bolsheviks \nand were marred, in Lenin's view, only by the fact that seven \nMensheviks also were elected. Visits to Galicia by Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies occurred sporadically through 1913, and on two occasions \nthese coincided with Central Committee meetings in Krakow and \nPoronin. 29 Lenin offered plenty of advice to the deputies. All \noccurred in Galicia,31 and Lenin, naturally, played a prominent role. 32 Pravda and the Duma \ndeputies were the addressees most frequently contacted, but commu-\nnication was kept up also with many other Bolshevik supporters in \nthe Romanov lands. Krupskaya's address-book was being rapidly \nfilled and by mid-1914 it contained 271 names of contacts in the \nRussian empire, and included Bolsheviks for nearly every province of \nthe Romanov empire. Lenin railed at those who would not write regularly. 35 \nRevolutionaries in the Russian political underground, harassed by \na life on the run from the Okhrana, responded frostily to his \nimprecations. The Foreign \nBureau, since only Lenin and Zinoviev were based in the emigra-\ntion, sounded grander than it really was; and the joint sessions of the \nemigres and the Russian undergrounders prevented Lenin from \nclaiming to speak in the name of all Bolsheviks without consulta-\ntion. With the exception of Malinovski, the \nBolshevik Duma deputies rejected his calls for a clean split from the \nMenshevik deputies; they were willing to sit in the Duma under the \nchairmanship of Menshevik N. Most of the \nBolshevik Duma deputies even wanted a merger of Bolshevik Pravda \nand Menshevik Luch.40 The editors of Pravda too proved capable of \nstanding up to Lenin.44 \nWithout ever becoming dominant, on the other hand, Lenin's \ninfluence grew stronger. \nAnd Lenin made the most of his advantages.46 In autumn 1912, Stalin was chosen by a Central \nCommittee meeting to go to St Petersburg and take charge of \nPravda. Not for the last time, Lenin acted to \ncorrect Stalin's line.49 \nUnfortunately for them as well as for Lenin, both Sverdlov and \nStalin were arrested in February 1913, but their replacement as \neditor, Miron Chernomazov, was greatly to Lenin's liking. Taking \nover in May 1913, Chernomazov took exactly the polemical posture \ntraditionally demanded by Lenin; and fifty articles by Lenin \nappeared in the initial two months of his editorship. \nIn the Duma fraction, Bolsheviks such as M. At Poronin in September 1913, ten months after taking \ntheir seats in the Duma, they finally acceded to his arguments: 52 in \nOctober, Bolshevik and Menshevik deputies sat apart. But the persuasiveness of \nLenin, and indeed of Malinovski who worked alongside them, must \nalso have contributed to the Bolshevik deputies' eventual decision to \nbreak with their Menshevik counterparts. Lenin had exerted considerable authority in Central Commit-\ntee, in the Bolshevik Duma fraction and in Pravda. 55 He boasted in public about the election of Bolsheviks \nto the union boards. 57 \nLocal Bolshevik bodies experienced no general renaissance. Acting as \nCentral Committee secretary, Krupskaya received doleful messages \nfrom the Russian empire. The Bolsheviks had no answer to the police's interventions. \nTHE 'NATIONAL QUESTION' \nLenin, despite frequent invitations from Pravda, wrote next to \nnothing about the trade unions; there was to be no equivalent of \nWhat Is To be Done. He went further than any Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty leader in taking account of the national aspirations of non-\nRussians, and demanded that 'the nations oppressed by the tsarist \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonarchy' should be granted 'the right of self-determination, i. Lenin the \ncentralist and internationalist par excellence agreed, but argued that \ntactical subtlety was required. The August 1912 gathering of non-Bolshevik factions con-\nvoked by Trotski had approved this very slogan. Lenin also started to emphasise, as he had not done \nbefore reading the work of Bauer (as well as of Karl Kautsky), that \nnationalism would neither disappear for a lengthy epoch nor rule out \nthe possibility of economic and cultural advance for newly-indepen-\ndent nations.67 The Jewish Bund in the Russian Social-Democratic \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLabour Party had always Ieant in this direction and successfully \nadvocated it in Vienna in August 1912.69 Bauer did not have Jogiches's \nabsolute hostility to national independence movements in Europe; \nbut that did not stop Lenin from banding them together in his \npolemics against them. 70 \nLenin's main criticism was that the respective proposals of both \nBauer and the non-Bolshevik factions at Trotski's Vienna gathering \nin August 1912 were inherently bureaucratic, inefficient and anti-\ncentralist. 71 \nThe replies of Lenin's opponents have fallen into undeserved \nneglect. Both the outstanding \nGeorgian Menshevik leader and theorist Noi Zhordania and \nTrotski's sympathiser S. \nLenin in power was to appreciate the need to go beyond dealing \nwith the national question through autonomous nationally-based \nterritorial units. 74 \nAt all events Zhordania, rightly impugned Lenin in 1913 for trying \nto terminate debate before discussions had run their course.75 Lenin \nwas, in fact, more forthcoming in the other half of the dispute: in his \npolemic against Luxemburg and Jogiches. Moreover, he knew that most leading Bolshevik \ntheorists sympathised with Luxemburg's analysis. 76 Some were \nRussian neophytes like Nikolai Bukharin and Georgi Pyatakov; \nothers were non-Russians such as the Georgian Filip Makharadze \nand the Jewish Evgeniya Bosh. 77 Lenin could not afford not to \nengage them in an exchange of opinions.81 He made a similar \nargument about the Ukraine in the November-December 1913 issue \nof Enlightenment. 82 He avoided repeatedly both outright support for \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand outright opposition to Finnish, Polish and Ukrainian indepen-\ndence.84 Alone of leading \nBolshevik theorists, Stalin came to Lenin's assistance before the \n1914-1918 war.85 Indeed, Stalin provided easily the most compre-\nhensive Bolshevik analysis of the national question.86 And yet even Stalin, writing in Enlightenment \nfrom March 1913 onwards, was more eager to excoriate the Bund \nthan to argue the positive case for Lenin's policy. 87 \nBut it was close enough to Lenin's views for Lenin to be \nenormously grateful. But \nLenin glossed over the difficulty. 90 Secondly, Lenin firmly rejected \nfederalism in all its guises.93 \nSCANDALS \nLenin none the less continued to exude exceptional self-confidence. He welcomed Bauman \nenthusiastically as a future Bolshevik, using his services as a \ntroublemaker from the floor at the Second Party Congress.95 \nBauman's death in 1905 inspired Lenin to write a fulsome obituary \ndedicated to 'the eternal memory of a fighter in the ranks of Russian \nsocial-democracy'. 96 \nThe choice of an undesirable personage such as Bauman as not \nonly an acceptable but even a respected associate boded ill for the \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbehaviour of Bolsheviks when (as, admittedly, hardly seemed very \nlikely before the First World War) they took power in Russia. This was part and parcel of his \nsupport for the armed robberies conducted by Bolsheviks in the \nRussian empire in 1906-9 as well as his condoning of the marriage of \nBolsheviks A. In 1914, furthermore, it \nbecame abundantly clear that Lenin's prudence could not be taken \nfor granted; and it was not Stalin but a more pressing evil, R. Malinovski, Central Committee \nmember and Bolshevik spokesman in the State Duma, vanished from \nSt Petersburg in mid-May.99 The intensifying rumours that he was an \nOkhrana informer were confirmed for everyone but Lenin. \nLenin had spurned them as a slur on Malinovski and an attempt \nto sow dissension among Bolsheviks loyal to him. But in 1912 the young Bolshevik theorist \nNikolai Bukharin arrived in Krakow. 100 Bukharin plainly meant \nLenin well, and Lenin was pleased to welcome a comrade who \nregarded himself as a 'pupil'; but Bukharin was convinced that the \nstories about Malinovski and his undercover role for the Okhrana \nwere accurate. He was \nbetter off than his Duma stipend permitted; he enthusiastically \nbacked Lenin's schismatic schemes among Bolsheviks even in that \nfirst year after the Prague Conference when other pro-Lenin \nBolshevik leaders, such as Stalin, were loathe to endorse them \nwithout qualification; and arrests of comrades were made which \nwere only explicable either by boundless ill-luck or by the existence of \na highly-placed police agent: nobody seriously suspected Lenin, \nZinoviev or Kamenev. But Lenin \nintransigently refused to accept the case. 103 \nEven when Malinovski absconded in 1914, Lenin refused to \nacknowledge reality. Again, in 1913, Lenin had written to Kamenev: \n'We have suffered some heavy arrests.' 105 To have recognised Malinovski for \nwhat he was would have led to a bout of self-reproach which was not \ncongenial to Lenin. Malinovski had been the \nBolshevik chiefs eyes, ears and even mouth in Russia. \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis blunder of Lenin's was not his worst error. Lenin \nbelieved what he wanted to believe. \nA telegram was sent from Krakow adjuring the Bolshevik Duma \nfraction not 'to get nervous'; its members were asked to refrain from \nexpelling Malinovski from the fraction. \nYet Malinovski had retained credence in his ability to delude \nLenin. 111 Lenin, judging by his dismissive remarks about \nBukharin's being 'credulous about gossip' in 1916, 112 continued to \nfeel that the entire affair was a provocation concocted by as yet \nunidentified enemies of Bolshevism; he even wrote to Malinovski, \nafter he fell into German captivity in the war, in pursuit of further \ncollaboration. 113 \n Storms Before the Storm \n51 \nDEBATES ON WAR AND IMPERIALISM \nIf Lenin's choice of associates was widely thought to be faulty, his \nattitude to imperialism and militarism caused small resentment in his \nparty. 114 \nThe Bolshevik I. 116 \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe first to undertake a serious analysis of the causes of \nimperialism was Karl Kautsky, who summarised his arguments in \nhis book Socialism and C o/onialism, in 1907. 118 \nLenin read Kautsky's articles in Die Neue Zeit, but barely added to \nthe literature. 121 A few \nsimilar statements came from Lenin before 1904,122 when Russia \nwent to war against Japan. \nEvidently Lenin was no less ambiguous about it than was Marx. In \nLenin's view, the Russo-Japanese war was a struggle 'between a \ndespotic and backward government and politically free and culturally \nfast progressing people'. 124 Lenin's judgement on the extent of \nfreedom in Japan may be challenged; but, in the tradition of Marx \nand Engels, he took sides in a given war by the criterion of the \nrespective political and economic 'progressiveness' of the two \nbelligerent states. Kautsky, for the German Social-Democratic Party, \nwrote passionately about the rise of militarism in Europe; and Lenin, \nMartov and Rosa Luxemburg wanted to shape a framework for \naction in the event of a general European \\\\ar.129 Lenin was content. Lenin \n(and here he left Luxemburg behind) emphasised that 'revolutionary \nwars' might be necessary. Lenin read \nRadek's pamphlet and took notes, but again he did not reveal his \nopinion;144 nor did he comment on the possibility, mooted by \nKautsky from 1911, that the imperial nations might mitigate their \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrivalry and avoid war by reaching a concordat for the peaceful \ncollective exploitation of all colonial peoples. 145 This idea, which \nbecame known as the theory of 'ultra-imperialism', caused Lenin to \nput pen to paper only after 1914. Lenin, having failed \nto be disconcerted by Hilferding and Radek, was annoyed with \nLuxemburg. Ilin' (which was Lenin's main legal pseudonym) \nhad been wrong to criticise populists such as V. 155 \nTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU \nEurope's leading Marxist writers were familiar with the theories of \nLenin. But the level of acquaintance was low outside that group; only \na few eccentrics with a highly-developed interest in Marxian theory \nor with an idiosyncrasy for staying in touch with the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party's affairs could have filled an area bigger \nthan a postage stamp with their knowledge about Bolshevism. Lenin \nand Krupskaya rented a succession of apartments in central and \neastern Europe in streets where the neighbours had no idea of \nBolshevik politics and, as likely as not, would not have cared to \nacquire one either. \nNonetheless there was one political forum on the Continent where \nLenin was not only famous but also a major and obtrusive figure: the \nInternational Socialist Bureau. This was \nnot the First Socialist International of Karl Marx and Mikhail \nBakunin, but the Second, which had existed since 1889. Lenin attended Bureau sessions in \nthe autumns of 1908 and 1909. This tranquillity started to come to an end with the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, which reunited the \nfactional leaderships of Russian social-democracy and turned over \nthe disputed funds from the legacy of N. All \nthree were prominent figures in the Socialist International, and their \ndeliberations about Russian social-democratic finances dragged the \nISB into the morass of Bolshevik-Menshevik disputes. 159 \nNot approving of the outbreak of peace with the Mensheviks at the \nJanuary 1910 plenum, Lenin felt uneasy about what the arbitrators \nmight do with the money. By November 1910 he was claiming that it \nrightfully belonged only to the Bolsheviks. 162 \nLenin refused to relent, visiting Berlin in March 1911 with N. \nPoletaev, the Bolshevik editor of The Star, to negotiate with Kautsky \nand his two colleagues. Neither \nZetkin nor the other two arbitrators could forget that Lenin wished \nto split the Bolsheviks from the Mensheviks, and that a definitive \nrelease of the money to two separate factions would hasten such a \ndivision. She was unwilling to act unaccompanied \nas an arbitrator and, as Lenin could see, was not averse to supposing \nthat the Bolsheviks had better legal title to the money than the \nMensheviks; 168 but still she declined to take a decision. 171 Bolsheviks G. The bemused Ducos de la Haille predictably got nowhere in \nthe time appointed - not that this was condoned by Lenin, who wrote \nto complain in September 1912. 172 Lenin sought another lawyer. In \nMarch 1913, admitting to his own 'hyper-suspiciousness', Lenin \nrequested Kamenev not to pay out any cheque until he had received \nthe necessary documents. 174 In December 1913, Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute.175 Lenin foresaw that this \n 60 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould lead not only to a financial settlement quite unsatisfactory to \nhim but also to moves towards the party's organisational reunifica-\ntion. 176 Now it was Lenin's turn to \ntemporise. The ISB's invitation to Bolsheviks and Mensheviks to \nexchange opinions could not be resisted unless he was willing to \nappear to be the party splitter he really was; and, in any case, \nsocialist lawyers such as Zraggen (who was now regarded as 'very \nweak and cowardly' by Lenin) 177 did not wish to obstruct the ISB's \nplan. \nLenin's ploy was to accept the invitation to 'a mutual exchange of \nopinions' of the Russian factions while expressing objection to \nKautsky's characterisation of the Russian Social-Democratic La-\nbour Party. He beavered away at the statistics of the votes for \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks at the 1912 State Duma elections and \nat the respective print-run of Bolshevik and Menshevik newspapers. \nHis motivations were only barely disguised: Lenin wanted to seize \nand retain the mantle of legitimacy for the Bolshevik-controlled \n'party' he had inaugurated at the Party Conference in Prague in 1912; \nand he had no intention of going to the ISB's proposed 'exchange of \nopinions' meeting in order to give up his grasp on a Bolshevik-\ndominated Central Committee. But this would require a barrage of \npreparatory propaganda to convince the ISB that the Bolsheviks \nwere indeed the sole representatives of organised Marxism in the \nRussian empire and that the Mensheviks comprised only a gaggle of \nunattached emigres and anti-party, Russia-based 'Liquidators'. Lenin had not \nattended the ISB meeting in December 1913, and he made clear that \nhe would absent himself from international gatherings in the months \nto come. 183 \nRUSSIA IN 1914 \nAnd so, in the first half of 1914, Lenin faced organisational problems \nboth international and Russian. 184 This was another device \nto arrogate legitimacy for the Bolsheviks as the principal constituent \nmembers of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Krakow delegates \nwould be able to travel on to Vienna to lobby for the Bolshevik \ncause. 186 \nThis was characteristic bluff and skulduggery from Lenin. As with \nthe Prague Conference arrangements, various commissions were \nappointed to ensure that Bolsheviks commanded the selection and \nvetting of delegates. 187 Lenin had either learned from Prague or \nbowed to advice from colleagues: a genuine invitation would be \nissued in a timely fashion to the Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians so \nas to avoid the criticisms of his neglect of the non-Russian segments \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof the party in 1912. 188 \nLenin knew full well that his Congress's self-proclamation as the \nparty's supreme assembly would be challenged by all non-Bolsheviks. 189 He highlighted the activity of the \nBolshevik deputies to the Fourth State Duma, and emphasised that \nthe Bolsheviks had swept the board in the workers' constituencies in \nSt Petersburg and Moscow, whereas the Mensheviks had scored \nvictories in more peripheral areas and often through electoral pacts \nwith liberals. Much was also made about the election of Bolshevik \nactivists to trade union boards. His claim, which may have been \nsomewhat exaggerated, was that at least sixteen out of the capital's \ntwenty boards had moved towards the Bolsheviks.191 This was trumpery even by Lenin's standards. These were \nBolshevik slogans, 193 but it is a moot point whether acquaintance \nwith Bolshevism went beyond this or indeed whether most workers \non demonstrations acquired their ideas directly from Bolsheviks. \nPravda editorials; speeches by the Bolshevik Duma deputies; public \nstatements of Bolshevik trade unionists: all these had to be cautiously \nformulated so as not to attract punitive actions by police and censor. \nUnconstrained discussion of Bolshevik ideas occurred only in the \nRussian political underground, in Siberian exile and in the emigra-\ntion. Lenin and Krupskaya had no illusions about the weakness and \nlow morale in the illegal party apparatus. In February 1914, \nKrupskaya wrote bluntly: 'The illegal organisation is pulverised. The Moscow \ncomrades talked of 'a complete break-up' of party groups. 196 Lenin \nput the problem in a nutshell (but did so in a private letter, \npresumably to avoid further demoralisation among his followers in \nRussia): 'The revolutionary mood arising in recent times in Russia \nhas the tendency to keep growing but, being insufficiently guided in \nthe absence of well-established underground organisations, can \nbecome powerless and aimless.' 197 The Bolshevik leader was not \nthe only politician to wring his hands. As always, the huge size of many \nfactories and accompanying feelings of 'alienation' among workers \ncreated difficulties; and the appalling environment, with its under-\nprovision of housing and poor sewage and recreational facilities, \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincreased the probability of political crisis. \nLenin recognised this; and, when he was not busy explaining to the \nInternational Socialist Bureau that the Bolsheviks were in better \nshape and had greater support than the Mensheviks, urged his \ncomrades to do their utmost to re-establish the illegal party \napparatus. Krupskaya's notebook continued to acquire names/01 \nbut it was of limited practical use since the police were so skilful in \ncapturing revolutionaries. Signs of vigorous communication between \nthe Central Committee and the Russian political underground are \nfew. In three out of the first six months of 1914, apparently, Lenin \ndid not even write to the Bolshevik Duma deputies; and these \ndeputies, overburdened with Duma activities and other speaking \nand writing engagements, seldom visited him. 202 There was also the usual pressure on Lenin to \ncool his polemical ardour. 203 Dissatisfaction with Lenin was also expressed in \nhis discharge of technical duties.'205 \nBy 1914 Lenin, too, had come to see that his protege Chernoma-\nzov's zest for polemics was causing more harm than good; and that \nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs was being provided with regular \nexcuses to shut down Pravda. Lenin acceded to Chernomazov's \nremoval and was able, because of the shortage of competent \njournalistic talent in the capital, to secure agreement for his \nassociate Kamenev (who no longer had Workers' Newspaper to edit \nin Paris) to take over Pravda's direction in February 1914. 207 \nNor was the Central Committee as troublesome to Lenin as it once \nhad been. The Bolshevik underground members who had been \nelected at Prague and had objected to his methods - Ordzhoni-\nkidze, Goloshchekin, Spandaryan - had been arrested; and the sole \nCentral Committee member from the Party Mensheviks, D. \nStalin, I. None of them, with the exception of \nStalin, 209 stood up to Lenin as Ordzhonikidze and his friends had \ndone. At any rate Lenin was accorded much scope for initiative, at \nleast in regard to the politics of the emigration. The International \nSocialist Bureau's December 1913 decision to invite all factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party to an 'exchange of views' \nmeeting in Brussels lay on the table.210 For some months, Lenin was \nunruffled.212 Things became stickier for Lenin when the Malinovski \nscandal erupted and, as might easily have been predicted, non-\nLeninists in the party were raising a hue and cry about Lenin's \nconvoking his own Party Congress. Lenin felt he was not the faction's ideal spokes-\nman: he would lose his temper and his opponents would have a \nchance to interrogate him.217 \nLenin worked to extricate himself from the mess. He went on \ncollating information on the respective strengths of the Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the legal labour movement in Russia. Nikiforova took part \nas leading Bolshevik activists in Russia.220 Lenin's subsequent letter to Bolshevik Duma deputy, \nF. Summer 1914 \nwitnessed renewed labour unrest in the Romanov empire: a general \nstrike was organised by workers in Baku in June; and, from 4 July, \nstrikes and demonstrations began in St Petersburg. 222 It is impressive that \nthe Bolshevik supreme leadership, which had insisted that the \nMensheviks underrated the revolutionary potential of the working \nclass, sat around on Lenin's veranda in Poronin oblivious of the \ndisorder in St Petersburg.", "Bolshevik_Leaders_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in 1917, were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Millions of people perished in \n67 \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after 1918, was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. The Allies, including Russia, confronted the Central Powers. \nRussia's relations with Austria-Hungary had deteriorated over the \nprevious decade; and Germany's pretensions in both Eastern Europe \nand the Near East had intermittently heightened tension between St \nPetersburg and Berlin. German army leaders advised that the \nachievements of Russian industrial development were such that, if \nGermany's security was to be guaranteed, Russian power had to be \ndestroyed by a pre-emptive war. \nBy 1914, the Russian emperor judged that his country's prestige \nand geopolitical interest in the Balkans were at stake. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. And yet he was little \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Obsessive as he was about controlling Bolshevik affairs, he \nseldom let them expunge everything else from his mind. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn 1914. \n Ad Extirpanda \n71 \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. The additional danger for the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders was that, as Russian subjects, they and their \nwives might come under suspicion in Austrian-ruled Poland as being \nspies. Anti-Russian sentiment was \nrife among local Poles. All Russian emigrants could expect to be \ncontacted by the police authorities in Krakow sooner or later and \nLenin was an obvious object of mistrust. Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. Bagocki was to recall that Lenin was agitated \nless by his personal situation than by the Second International \nleadership's reaction to the war. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. '9 There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. 11 \nIt was among the socialists of the Romanov empire that hostility \nto the war was strongest and most pervasive. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort.16 \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn 7 August 1914 Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. Marek, a social-democratic \nparliamentarian in Austria-Hungary, to seek his intercession on \nLenin's behalf. 22 Adler and \nDiamand responded helpfully, declaring to the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs in Vienna that the suspected Russian spy Lenin was well-\nknown throughout Europe for his dedication to the 'struggle against \nRussian tsarism'.24 \nLenin returned to Bialy Dunajec. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 33 But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. 34 \nANNOUNCING A POLICY \nSettling again in Switzerland, Lenin was a leader with an even \nsmaller following than in the pre-war period. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. 37 They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. But Lenin maintained that neither the \nCentral Powers nor the Allies should be analysed so generously.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension. Here was \nan emigre revolutionary, lacking finances, organisation and person-\nnel, declaring to his colleagues that propaganda should be directed at \ntelling the largely patriotic population in Russia to welcome the \ncountry's conquest. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either.44 \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland.48 The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. A meeting of the Duma deputies and other \nBolshevik leaders, including Kamenev, was held at Ozerki outside \nSt Peterburg. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. 56 Thus Lenin urged multilateral defeatism. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. For Plekhanov, Lenin had become an insane sloganeer \ninstead of a serious politician. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. He no longer had the slightest respect for \nany leading Marxist in Europe. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats. Lenin turned the paucity of surviving Central Committee \nmembers to his advantage.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. 79 \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. Undoubtedly there was political \ntrouble for the Russian imperial authorities, especially in St \nPetersburg, in the month before the declaration of war. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis.82 Other Russian Marxists, however, believed that \nLenin and Zinoviev idealised German working-class attitudes.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914.92 \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'.93 \nWhere Zinoviev and Lenin marched intellectually, not only \nMichels but also European social-democratic leftists such as Rosa \nLuxemburg and Anton Pannekoek had gone before. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. Yet Lenin's \nhopes about Shlyapnikov were soon dashed. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. 104 \nBukharin came perilously close to repudiating the old Russian \nMarxist premise that Russia's next revolution would be a 'bour-\ngeois' one. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. 105 \nYet Bukharin and Pyatakov did not carry the conference with \nthem; and Lenin had pragmatic reasons for not exacerbating or \nadvertising his conflict with the Baugy group. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. After the Bern conference of Bolshevik emigres, Bukharin \nmoved to Scandinavia. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. In spring 1915, \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1908-\n9, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. 126 This led Lenin to a further modification. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. \nImportant differences between the respective standpoints of Lenin \nand Bogdanov anyway remained. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of 1915, when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him. Lenin's \nphilosophical cerebrations did not precede and predetermine his \npolitics. He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nD.", "Bolshevik_Leaders_1918": " 1 Merciless Retreat \n'THE CURRENT TASKS OF SOVIET POWER' \nLenin was a mercurial mixture as a political leader. The changes made by the Bolsheviks in \ntheir policies after the October Revolution of 1917 were drastic. The \nBolsheviks had also expected to rule a multinational state with the \nsupport of the non-Russian nationalities. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. Public \nopinion had been prepared by Bolshevik propaganda, insofar as such \npropaganda had any effect, for a revolutionary process unmarred by \nproblems. Officers in their thousands \nfrom the demobilised Imperial Army were assembling in southern \nRussia and in mid-Siberia; their objective was the overthrow of Lenin's \nregime. \nSovnarkom, as Lenin's government was known, had survived for a \nnumber of reasons. His Decree on Land gave him credit with the \npeasants, and the Bolsheviks at least did well among the working class \nand garrison soldiers in the Constituent Assembly elections. The \nexhausting conditions of everyday life also worked in the Bolshevik \nparty's favour. Yet the Bolsheviks could not afford to be \ncomplacent. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Every leading Bolshevik appreciated \nthe acuteness of the regime's crisis. None forgot the \nabruptness of the emperor Nikolai II's forced abdication in February \n1917 or minister-president Aleksandr Kerenski's flight from the Winter \nPalace in October. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nNo Bolshevik leader was in greater danger than Lenin. About his likely \nfate in the event of the Bolshevik party's overthrow there could be little \ndoubt. Aside from such \nblack propaganda, however, Lenin was undeniably more responsible \nthan any fellow Bolshevik for the actions of his party. But Lenin \nhad to live with the consequences and was in no mood to regret or \napologise. Lenin's political friends were sorely in need of guidance. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Nor was \nhis own Bolshevik party quiescent. Lenin's proposals \ntook the form of a lengthy pamphlet written in the second fortnight of \n1918. Pamphleteering was his most congenial medium of communica-\ntion with fellow Bolsheviks except for speeches to their Congresses. But Lenin was an experienced journalist and \ncould write fast and, when he set his mind to it, forcefully. The result \nwas The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Lenin avoided reference to \nopponents in the Bolshevik party and mentioned the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries only fleetingly. The Brest-Litovsk treaty, that momentous treaty \nwhich had ended hostilities on the Eastern front in the Great War, was \n 4 \nLenin: A Political Life \nscarcely cited. \nHe was astonishingly casual about armed resistance to the \nBolsheviks. Possibly his dismissal of the potential military threat was a \nmere device to fix Bolshevik eyes on the politics and the economy. Lenin seldom failed to bang the war-drum when \nalarmed about the future. Residing in the \nKremlin in Moscw and hearing about events elsewhere in Russia only \nintermittently, Lenin simply blundered.4 The party's priority, according to Lenin, should be the \nintroduction of strict account-keeping and control. Lenin's basic aim was less to create an atmosphere of \nliberation than to get labourers, skilled and unskilled, to raise their \nlevel of discipline and productivity.6 He was blunt: 'The Russian \nworker is a bad worker in comparison with the advanced nations. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished.' \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOPPOSITION AND SURVIVAL \nThe resistance was beginning to cause panic. It would be an \nexaggerated claim that, had Lenin cracked under the strain, the \nBolsheviks would have gone under. 15 The fervid atmosphere seemed to \nleave Lenin cool.' 16 The capacity to close off his mind to distractions was \naccompanied by an ability to impart his confidence to the rest of the \nBolshevik central leadership.17 \nEven the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who wanted to see the treaty \nof Brest-Litovsk torn up, did not envisage Lenin's permanent removal \nfrom the chairmanship of Sovnarkom. Karl Radek, a Bolshevik \nopponent of the treaty, was approached by the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Pavel Proshyan at a meeting of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets with the question: \n'Wouldn't it be simpler to arrest Lenin for a day, declare war on the \nGermans and then wholeheartedly elect comrade Lenin again as \nSovnarkom chairman.' 18 The matter was not just personal (although a \nrecognition of Lenin's exceptional qualities as a leader was involved). The Urals Regional \nCommittee and the Moscow Regional Committee, as well as the \nTaganrog Conference of Bolsheviks fleeing from Ukraine in the path of \nthe German military occupation, were vehemently hostile to Brest-\nLitovsk and all it stood for. 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees. The Moscow \nRegional Committee was their first and most important victim.21 \n Merciless Retreat \n7 \nAt the same time Lenin no more wanted to lose the Left Communists \nthan they him.22 Lenin saw that the Bolsheviks \nwere too few to be able to dispense with a faction's assistance; but the \nwords of the decision reflect also his condescension to the Left \nCommunists as being given to light-headed abstractions in their \nthinking. They were centralisers to an even higher \ndegree than Lenin. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. \nNikolai Bukharin, Nikolai Osinski and V. Bukharin had \nalready produced a pamphlet entitled The Programme of the \nCommunists (Bolsheviks). 23 Despite being schematic and full of \njargon, the writings of this left-wing Bolshevik troika appealed to \nmany, perhaps even most, long-standing party activists. Lenin \nconsequently had reason to fear Bukharin's return to the fold. They were still more utopian and incoherent than Lenin;24 but \nin practice, like him, they tended to support centralist force against \nlocally-established collective endeavours whenever they had to make a \nchoice.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. Lenin kept up the pressure.30 Lenin's blood was up. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. But Bolsheviks of all persuasions hardly \ncared. Lenin and his opponents in his own party \nhad found common cause once more, and were relieved that they could \nwork together again. 31 \n Merciless Retreat \n9 \nNot only Lenin but also his colleagues were recklessly narrowing the \npolitical base of their regime. Their alienation of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Party was accompanied by persecution of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. Bolsheviks were made \nanxious by the rise in working-class antipathy to themselves. The discontent \nwas simply transferred to other arenas: anti-Bolshevik sentiment found \nexpression in the growing popularity of the movement for an Assembly \nof Plenipotentiaries among Petrograd workers. Strikes broke out in \nnorthern Russia, and an improvised demonstration at Kolpino on 9 \nMay was fired upon by troops loyal to the Bolsheviks. The Putilov Works, which in 1917 had \nprominently supported the Bolshevik political advance, came out in \nsympathy with the Kolpino demonstrators. 32 But Lenin was in no \nmood to yield. Lenin was pre-occupied by the diplomatic \nand military crisis rather than rendered cowardly by the prospect of \njustifying his policies to the Central Executive Committee. Five days later, on 14 \nMay, Lenin returned to the political fray and castigated the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with ferocity. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries continued to \nparticipate fitfully in public affairs over the ensuing three years, but \nalways on Bolshevik terms. That Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik Central Committee \nshould have rushed so fast to impose such a dictatorship is evidence of \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir extraordinary confidence that, despite the terrific reverses \nendured by them at home and abroad since October 1917, history \nwas on their side. Lenin was extremely \ndull about anticipating the scale and timing of outbreaks of civil war. He made \nno effort to smooth relations between the Legion and the Bolshevik-led \nsoviets of the towns they passed through along the railway line.39 \nWhere Trotski lurched, Lenin followed. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. Lenin received an appeal for assistance \nfrom the Penza Bolshevik leader Minkin.42 \nEMERGENCY IN MOSCOW \nThe Czechoslovaks had had no intention of overthrowing Sovnarkom; \nbut on arrival in Samara they were besought by the Socialist \nRevolutionaries, whose leaders had fled there after the dissolution of \nthe Constituent Assembly, to fight on behalf of Komuch. Komuch asserted that it had the most legitimate claim to \nrule the country, and called for the overthrow of the Bolshevik party \ndictatorship. A half-day's train \njourney separated them from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and \nLenin. \nUnless a Red Army could quickly and effectively be moved into action, \nthe Bolshevik leadership would be caught in Moscow and overthrown. \nNonetheless it still appeared to the Central Committee under Lenin \nthat political retreat and reconciliation would endanger the regime to a \ngreater extent than pursuit of the existing policies. Lenin also \nrefused to be intimidated by the resumption of assassinations as a tactic \nby the Socialist Revolutionaries. Moscow became unsafe for the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee even though the Czechoslovaks had not yet moved from \nthe river Volga. \nSuch doubts as Lenin entertained he did not express. '43 \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMartov, for once in his life, underestimated Lenin's determination. \nPossibly the Bolshevik leader may have been wondering whether the \nbenefits of the treaty were as great as he had originally supposed; but \nnot for a moment did he deny that the signature of a separate peace \nwith Germany and Austria-Hungary was a better option than any \nconceivable alternative. Lenin \nwaited on events, and did not have to wait long. On 24 June the Central \nCommittee of the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries met secretly \nto approve the assassination of German diplomats in Moscow. The Left Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leaders hoped that this would lead to a rapprochement of their \nparty and the Bolsheviks in the cause of revolutionary war. \nIntimations of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary conspiracy reached the \nears of Felix Dzierzynski, Bolshevik chairman of the Cheka, on 28 \nJune. Yet victory for the Bolsheviks was already guaranteed by \ntheir majority over the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of voting places. Cheka \nfunctionary and Left Socialist-Revolutionary Yakov Blyumkin had \nentered the embassy premises accompanied by an associate. Lenin had no \n Merciless Retreat \n13 \nhesitation. Blyumkin's murderous action gave the Bolsheviks a \nchance to behave as if reacting to an outrage rather than merely \npersecuting fellow socialists. Lenin had it in mind to arrest \nand execute a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee. Disposi-\ntions were made for the detention of Left Socialist-Revolutionary \ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets in the Bolshoi Theatre. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. 50 \nLenin acted speedily for two reasons. The sole advantage to \nBerlin in retaining the Bolsheviks in power was their adherence to \nBrest-Litovsk. Without this, Lenin would be useless to the Germans. 51 \nLenin carried out the mission with distaste.'52 On arrival at the embassy, Lenin carried out the necessary \nformalities.53 \nLenin was glad to leave the embassy a few minutes later. \nUntil then they had neither revolted nor intended to break permanently \nwith the Bolsheviks; their strategy of assassination displayed an \ninfantile standard of calculation, but they had genuinely meant no \nharm to the Bolshevik party. To their horror they saw that the \nBolsheviks aimed at their suppression. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \nLenin resumed practical control. Vacietis's \nsupport was crucial in view of the military weakness of the Bolsheviks \nin Moscow; and the deployment of the Red Army to the Volga region \ncramped the possibilities of reinforcement from elsewhere.57 Yet he may also have begun to understand that the \nbalance of forces, ill-trained as most of them were on both sides, might \nsuddenly change to the disadvantage of the Bolsheviks.59 Yet \nTrotski can hardly have been high in Lenin's esteem at the time. The \npreservation of 'Soviet power' depended entirely upon the loyalty and \nefficiency of a Latvian officer who was neither a Bolshevik nor a \nproven military officer. \nFortunately for Lenin, Vacietis completed his task splendidly.61 An uprising of Left Socialist-Revolution-\naries had also been started in Yaroslavl, a town to Moscow's north \neast, on 6 July, but was suppressed a fortnight later. The former \ncoalition partners of the Bolsheviks went down to defeat; almost \nwithout noticing it, Lenin and the core of Bolshevik Central Committee \nmembers had passed over the threshold from a two-party revolutionary \ndictatorship into an outright dictatorship by one party. \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMANOEUVRE, RETREAT, WAIT \nLenin knew that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk depended entirely on the \nGerman government's intentions, and that these in turn were shaped \nby success or failure for German forces on the Western front. \nLenin did not lie supine in the meantime.63 The Bolsheviks deferred to Bertin; their \nforces were pathetically incompetent to resist. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement. Lenin's political survival depended on Allied military \nsuccess in the West at least until such time as the long-expected \nrevolution should break out in Berlin. Every political party in Russia regarded the \nBolsheviks as traitors. \nNot even Lenin wished to give public display of such submissiveness. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism. It appears to \nhave staggered Sokolnikov, who until then had been Lenin's supporter, \nthat the Germans had chosen and been able to rule Ukraine through \nlocal stooges. Two major party leaders, \nTrotski and Zinoviev, had not been present. Lenin was especially keen \nto secure backing from Trotski, who had been on the left side in the \nBrest-Litovsk controversy.79 Trotski and Zinoviev \nbacked Lenin.80 His \nsupport for Lenin disproved this. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were \nrecognised in Berlin as godless and anti-monarchical. But Bolshevism \nwas allowed to stay in power because it represented the sole Russian \nparty which would adhere to the Brest-Litovsk treaty; and, unless the \nRed Army could reassure Berlin about its capacity to resist insurrection \non Russian soil, the Bolshevik party would have been cast down by \n Merciless Retreat \n19 \nLudendorff. On 10 June, \nLenin rebuked the Bolsheviks in Kuban for mounting an attack on \nGerman troops in Taganrog, and similar instructions were issued two \ndays later to Red Army and Bolshevik party personnel on the Southern \nfront: no military engagement with the Germans was permissible. This information was as yet unavailable \nto Lenin. Yet Lenin anyway \nconsidered he had little choice. Consequently Lenin was even willing on 13 \nAugust to risk inviting the Germans, through Chicherin, to bomb \nArkhangelsk on Sovnarkom's behalf. A new era in the Soviet republic's relations with the governments \nand peoples of the rest of the world was heralded. Lenin had misled himself. But \nBrest-Litovsk had at least ensured the sheer survival of the Bolsheviks \nin power. It was an achievement of Lenin's gamble in international \nrelations. \nTHE WRITING OF A CONSTITUTION \nLenin scoffed at constitutionalism in politics. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above. The \nBrest-Litovsk dispute pre-occupied the minds of both the Bolsheviks \nand the Left SRs. Not until 30 March did the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee approve a proposal for the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets to set up a drafting \ncommission.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Sverdlov was commission chairman, and \nStalin was included as the Bolshevik official expert on the question of \nthe nationalities.90 Notable by his absence was Lenin. \nThe federal basis of the forthcoming Constitution had been \nestablished, on Lenin's recommendation, at the Third Congress of \n Merciless Retreat \n21 \nSoviets in January 1918.93 Sovnarkom at present \nruled only Russia- and not all Russia at that.96 The contrast with Lenin was \nimpressive. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress. Even so, Stalin was tossing aside the \nargument that Russians would be politically unwelcome in those parts \nof the Russian Empire unless the Bolshevik party went out of its way to \ndisclaim territorial acquisitiveness.98 Yet Lenin was \nso unexercised by the constitutional question that he did nothing until \nSverdlov's commission reported back to the Central Committee. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. This booklet, which had recently been published but \nhad been written in mid-1917, envisaged a revolutionary order with \nmuch greater scope for popular initiative than Lenin was willing to \ntolerate by 1918. All he could \nsay in reply was: 'Mention has been made here of comrade Lenin. I \nwould permit myself to remark that Lenin, so far as I know - and I \nknow very well -, has said that this project is worthless.' 103 Some \nBolshevik members remained unhappy with his performance. The need \nfor any reference to national issues rankled so much that Pokrovski, a \nBolshevik, preferred Reisner's draft. Lenin and \nStalin in 1917 had taken pains to get the slogan of national self-\ndetermination accepted in the Bolshevik party, and were convinced \nthat its deployment would help the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Lenin began to take an interest from a \ndistance. His main ambition for the Constitution was for it to rouse \nworkers and peasants to support the Bolsheviks. Instead he \nsubstituted a text already accepted at the Third Congress of Soviets, \nnamely 'The Declaration of Rights of the Labouring and Exploited \nPeople' submitted by Lenin to the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.105 \nSverdlov, understandably miffed, behaved like a disciplined \nBolshevik and induced the commission to comply on 17 June. 106 The \nBolshevik Central Committee, looking at the result nine days later, was \nunimpressed. Lenin even threatened to remove the Constitution from \nthe agenda of the forthcoming Congress of Soviets. 107 Sverdlov, who \nhad many other duties to fulfil at the same time, felt unappreciated by \nhis party leader. 109 Its final draft was \nperused by the Central Committee, in the presence of Lenin and \nTrotski, on 3 July. A last effort at polishing the style, but not the contents, was \nentrusted to Yuri Steklov; and it was Steklov, a leading ex-Menshevik \nwriter and editor, who was instructed to present the draft Constitution \nto the Fifth Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918. Nevertheless the \nBolshevik Central Committee did not introduce further amendments \nafter being released from the need to conciliate the party's coalition \npartners. \nAlready there was more flim-flam than substance in the Bolshevik \nparty's commitment to creating a federation. But the Bolshevik party leadership cynically hoped to \nattract the support of non-Russian peoples by showing off federalism \nas a slogan. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power. Yet \nLenin did not intend to agitate himself and his comrades over a \nquestion of Marxism which since 1917 had been dear to him. 118 The same section implicitly \ncleared the ground for the Bolsheviks to outlaw any political parties, \norganisations or newspapers. Vladimir Lenin would only \nbother with constitutional trifles when his current political purposes \nwere threatened. Trotski, Dzierzynski and Lenin \nconfronted a near-disastrous military situation. \nThe Bolshevik leaders had also seen the uses of the prisoners-of-war \ntaken by Russian armies in 1914-1917, especially those from the lands \nof the Hapsburg monarchy (and the Constitution itself had been \nformulated so as to grant citizenship to all foreigners working in Russia \nor fighting in the Red Army). But \nfew Russians were willing to fight. Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. 126 \nTrotski's efforts were intensified when the Czechoslovak Legion, on \nentering into Samara, put itself at the disposal of the Komuch \ngovernment of Socialist Revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the \nBolsheviks in Moscow. \nBonch-Bruevich (who, despite his anti-socialist convictions, was \nbrother to Lenin's personal assistant Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich). Sviyazhsk was \nheld and the Reds marched upon Kazan. Lenin stayed in Moscow in \nAugust. The \nfollowing note was dispatched to Trotski from Lenin: 'I'm sure that the \nsuppression of the Czechs and White Guards, as well as the \nbloodsucking kulaks who support them, will be a model of \nmercilessness. This \nprovoked outrage in the Bolshevik party. Rozengolts headed the court martial, was unrepentant \nand sought Lenin's support on 23 October. Its commander was Mikhail Tukhachevski. This was Lenin's birthplace. Lenin failed to understand the \ngeographical limitations of the Red victory. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards. \nLenin was not the sole Bolshevik to exult, and Pravda editorials were \nunderstandably keen to emphasise the successes in battle. Yet the \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncentral party leaders, both in the Kremlin and by the Volga, had little \nknowledge about other Russian forces being formed to attack the \nReds. Denikin, after the death of Lavr Kornilov in action in \nApril 1918, had taken over the armed units of anti-Bolshevism in \nsouthern Russia. From three sides of the compass \nthere was a threat to the existence of the Bolshevik party and the Soviet \ngovernment. Yet Lenin referred to none of them in his telegrams in \n1918. The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. Lenin, Trotski, Zinoviev, Kamenev, \nSverdlov: the entire leading cadre of the party took it as their duty to \ngo frequently among the workers and impress them with their \ncommitment to ideals which would soon become the predominant \npolitical reality. In fact the Bolshevik central leadership lived in \nconditions which, if they were modest by the standards of the tsars, \nwere yet far removed from the still increasing poverty of Russian \nfactory workers. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places. He was expected to \n29 \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspeak there in the afternoon and again at the Mikhelson Armaments \nFactory at around 6.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas. The Cheka had had its \nmen present at both the Corn Exchange and the Mikhelson Factory, \nand Bolshevik party officials likeN. Ivanov had also been there to \ngreet Lenin when he arrived to speak.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. On the same day as Lenin had been attacked in \nMoscow, a similar (and successful) attempt had been made on the life \nof the Cheka's chief in Petrograd, Moisei Uritski. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nSverdlov and his colleagues were ruthlessly seizing a chance to lay \ncollective guilt at the door of a party which had been overwhelmingly \nmore popular that the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly.22 \nSverdlov wanted to perpetuate the memory of the assault on Lenin \nwhile preventing a cult of the martyr who had allegedly attacked him.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. \n'PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND KAUTSKY THE \nRENEGADE' \nLenin was too frail to write in longhand; but, being determined to use \nhis unsought leisure to the full, he took on a short-hand secretary26 and \nbegan yet another booklet on Marxist theory: Proletarian Revolution \nand Kautsky the Renegade. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader. Kautsky for the first time had dedicated an entire work \nto Lenin and the questions raised by him.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here. Weakness was most \nremarkable in Lenin's replies to Kautsky's comments on Lenin himself. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable.37 Lenin was being hypocritical, too, inasmuch as his security \ntroops had recently fired on crowds of workers and his diplomats had \nmade unpublicised deals with the German emperor. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. They knew the reality of \n'Soviet power'. They had suppressed soviets and labour organisations \nwhich had turned against Bolshevism. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement.51 \nTERROR \nThe attempt on Lenin's life left him poorly for some weeks. 53 \nSocial echelons higher than the bourgeoisie had gone unmentioned \nby Lenin; but, out of public sight, he had been scrutinising them. \nNikolai II and the Imperial family had been moved around the country \nsince the February Revolution of 1917.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic.55 Sverdlov told the Central Committee on 19 May 1918 that a \ndefinitive decision was needed about 'what to do with Nikolai'. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. Its members were Lev Kamenev, \nIosif Stalin and D. He led a small group of Bolshevik leaders in \nMoscow who questioned whether the Cheka should be allowed to kill \nthe people it arrested without handing them over for due investigation \nand trial. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign. The problem \nwas that Kamenev was outnumbered in the inner counsels of the \nBolshevik central party leadership. This resulted in a minor victory for the anti-Cheka \nBolsheviks: the Cheka had previously gloried in its licence to ignore \nother institutions. Bukharin as an individual \ncould not be acquainted with all abuses, and arbitrary, hasty decisions \nremained intrinsic to the Bolshevik party's policy. Lenin's speeches were peppered with exculpations of the \nCheka. 86 Dzierzynski had requested that \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfraudsters in the state administration and the families of persons found \nto have gone over the Whites ought also to be subject to summary \nexecution by his officials. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him. His instructions to the \nPenza Bolshevik leaders on II August 1918 are testimony to this: \n'Hang no fewer than a hundred well-known kulaks, rich-bags and \nblood-suckers (and be sure that the hanging takes place in full view of \nthe people). The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated.97 \nThese world-changing events made no appearance on the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee agenda-sheet through to the end of the year. Lenin saw the \nSpartakusbund, which was a splinter group of the old German Social-\nDemocratic Party led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnecht, as the \nlikeliest ally; and Joffe was instructed to start talks with them on 20 \nSeptember. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. 107 Thus the Russian peasant was to give sustenance \nto both the Russian and the German worker. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. In October he had signed a \nfinancial deal with the German government for the delivery of 80,000 \ntons of coal to Russia; 109 and, in return, he ensured that the Bolsheviks \nof Ukraine did not try to attack the German troops. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. Rosa Luxem-\nburg and Karl Liebknecht had been released from prison some weeks \nbefore Wilhelm Il's abdication: Lenin welcomed them as future \ncomrades in the cause of the Third International and European \nsocialist revolution. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. \nWhile Lenin hoped that the Spartakists would form a German \nCommunist Party, Luxemburg wished - if a new party was to be \nformed - to call it the German Socialist Party so as to dissociate herself \nfully from the communist Lenin. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. 120 \nLuxemburg and Liebknecht would have made uncomfortable \npolitical partners for Lenin. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. There is no evidence that Lenin's attitude was not genuine. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. 122 \nREDS AND WHITES \nAmong the faults of the Spartakists had been their lack of organisation \nand preparation and their underestimation of the forces ranged against \nthem; and Lenin was right to highlight them. With no greater excuse he \nfailed to anticipate the abrupt transformation in the Russian Civil War \nin the last two months of 1918. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. Thus the Soviet republic of Russia was \nreduced to a territory little greater than the mediaeval principality of \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMuscovy. The Reds retreated in disorder on 13 \nDecember 1918. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. Lenin's telegram did not reproach \nTrotski or the Red Army high command. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. Since 1914 he \nhad rejected all attempts to make distinctions between reactionaries, \nconservatives, liberals and anti-Bolshevik socialists; his political \nuniverse was Manichean. When Kazan fell to the \nCzechoslovak Legion, Lenin and his colleagues had hardly begun to \n Closing the Circle \n51 \nreform their military and political machinery for war. The \nDon Cossacks were meanwhile causing difficulties for the Bolsheviks \nand their Red forces in the southern cities of the Volga; and the French \nhad landed their naval squadron in Odessa on the Black Sea on 18 \nDecember 1918. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. \nKolchak and Denikin might know about the Prinkipo offer; the \nBolshevik party, apart from a few Central Committee members, were \nkept in the dark. They were for 'Russia One and Indivisible', and in \nany case perceived that any settlement with Lenin would last only so \nlong as he felt too weak to attack them. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed. To the north, in Arkhangelsk, the \nexpected push against the Reds never happened; internal weakness and \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe unwillingness of the British to involve themselves to a great extent \nin the Civil War induced the local leader N. \nGeneral Krasnov was repulsed from Tsaritsyn, and his previous \nreadiness to treat with the Germans forced his resignation as Don \nCossack leader on IS February 1919.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. In the phrase of the day, \nCentral Committee members in Moscow 'were sitting on their \nsuitcases' through the winter. There could be no certainty that they \nwould hold Moscow against Kolchak and Denikin, and Bolshevik \nfamilies had to be ready to flee in an emergency. A flurry of long-distance conversations between Lenin and \nTrotski led to an agreement that the crisis on the Eastern front was too \nsevere for Trotski to be able to attend the forthcoming Eighth Party \nCongress. Lenin would have been the prime quarry of the \nWhites if ever they broke their way through to the capital. By the end of 1918 \nthere were nearly 140,000 committees of the village poor in European \nRussia; and 7370 peasant cells of the Bolshevik party had been \nestablished. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 152 \nDeeply implicated in establishing the committees, Lenin kept quiet \nabout the fracas. 156 Leading Bolsheviks \nwere turning to an extremely small region to victual both the Red \nArmy and the urban population of 'Sovdepiya'. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction.", "Duma_1907": " The Duma duly convened on 27 April.

Enquiries were made \nabout prices and passport regulations, and about the intensity of the \nlocal police's interest in Russian revolutionaries. It was \npossible to receive Russian newspapers within three days, and easier \nto contribute to and collaborate with the editors of the legal \nBolshevik press. 7 Krupskaya was to recall that Lenin was drawn to \nGalicia especially by his wish to influence the affairs of the factional \ndaily newspaper, Pravda, which had at last been issued in the capital \non 22 April 1912 under N. 8 An announcement \nthat a daily would be appearing had been made by the St Petersburg \nBolsheviks on 15 January (while the Prague Conference was taking \nplace);9 and the Prague delegates had supported schemes for an \nintensification of efforts in the legal press. Perhaps, too, police agents were right that Lenin \nwas already looking forward to the working of the Fourth State \nDuma. Again, it was easier to co-operate with Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies from Krakow than from Geneva or Paris. Lenin's letter to Gorki specified that the Central \nCommittee subsequently set up a Foreign Bureau in Galicia, 12 and \nthis could signify that he had moved under some pressure. Be that as \nit may, Lenin came to feel glad about the transfer. 14 In the year before moving \nto Galicia Lenin was contributing fewer articles to the Workers' \nNewspaper and Social-Democrat than to the Russia-based newspaper \nThe Star and the new periodical Enlightenment. 15 Nor were he and \nother emigre Bolsheviks alone in re-orientating their literary en-\ndeavours.17 The motivations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are \nuncertain; but perhaps the fact that no Bolshevik had up to then \nbeen similarly treated indicates that the Okhrana wanted to boost the \nmore moderate forces of Marxism in an attempt to check the growing \nradicalism of the workers' movement. Lenin, astounded that Dan \nhad even managed to visit Menshevik deputies in the State Duma, \nconfessed his bafflement about the 'game' being played by the \nauthorities. In March 1913, \n Storms Before the Storm \n37 \nLenin opted for a house near the summer resort village of Zakopane, \nwhich lay close by the town railway station of Poronin and a hundred \nkilometres from Krakow.21 \nThe Bolsheviks were not the only anti-Romanov revolutionaries in \nthe area. Josef \nPilsudski, the future vanquisher of the Red Army in the Soviet-\nPolish war in 1920 and dominant Polish politician in the inter-war \nperiod, led a faction which controlled the party's Combat Organisa-\ntion. That their private contacts were \ncloser is probable, since Zinoviev subsequently suggested that \nPilsudski's men helped the Bolsheviks with their security precau-\ntions. Indeed, it was Pilsudski, not \nLenin, whose extradition was requested by the St Petersburg \nauthorities. It is not too fanciful to suppose \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat the Galician sojourn greatly reinforced Lenin's feeling that \nRussian social-democrats should take the 'national question' in the \nRomanov empire more seriously. The elections \nto the Fourth State Duma had resulted in victory for six Bolsheviks \nand were marred, in Lenin's view, only by the fact that seven \nMensheviks also were elected. Visits to Galicia by Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies occurred sporadically through 1913, and on two occasions \nthese coincided with Central Committee meetings in Krakow and \nPoronin. 29 Lenin offered plenty of advice to the deputies. 32 Pravda and the Duma \ndeputies were the addressees most frequently contacted, but commu-\nnication was kept up also with many other Bolshevik supporters in \nthe Romanov lands. Krupskaya's address-book was being rapidly \nfilled and by mid-1914 it contained 271 names of contacts in the \nRussian empire, and included Bolsheviks for nearly every province of \nthe Romanov empire. Lenin railed at those who would not write regularly. 35 \nRevolutionaries in the Russian political underground, harassed by \na life on the run from the Okhrana, responded frostily to his \nimprecations. The Foreign \nBureau, since only Lenin and Zinoviev were based in the emigra-\ntion, sounded grander than it really was; and the joint sessions of the \nemigres and the Russian undergrounders prevented Lenin from \nclaiming to speak in the name of all Bolsheviks without consulta-\ntion. 37 He was also deemed to be insufficiently energetic in \nsupplying the drafts of official party statements (for example, about \nthe trade unions) which were requested from St Petersburg by the \nDuma deputies and others. With the exception of Malinovski, the \nBolshevik Duma deputies rejected his calls for a clean split from the \nMenshevik deputies; they were willing to sit in the Duma under the \nchairmanship of Menshevik N. Most of the \nBolshevik Duma deputies even wanted a merger of Bolshevik Pravda \nand Menshevik Luch.40 The editors of Pravda too proved capable of \nstanding up to Lenin.42 Lenin muttered that Pravda was a 'sleepy old \nspinster'.49 \nUnfortunately for them as well as for Lenin, both Sverdlov and \nStalin were arrested in February 1913, but their replacement as \neditor, Miron Chernomazov, was greatly to Lenin's liking. Taking \nover in May 1913, Chernomazov took exactly the polemical posture \ntraditionally demanded by Lenin; and fifty articles by Lenin \nappeared in the initial two months of his editorship. \nIn the Duma fraction, Bolsheviks such as M. At Poronin in September 1913, ten months after taking \ntheir seats in the Duma, they finally acceded to his arguments: 52 in \nOctober, Bolshevik and Menshevik deputies sat apart. But the persuasiveness of \nLenin, and indeed of Malinovski who worked alongside them, must \nalso have contributed to the Bolshevik deputies' eventual decision to \nbreak with their Menshevik counterparts. Lenin had exerted considerable authority in Central Commit-\ntee, in the Bolshevik Duma fraction and in Pravda. 55 He boasted in public about the election of Bolsheviks \nto the union boards. 57 \nLocal Bolshevik bodies experienced no general renaissance. The Bolsheviks had no answer to the police's interventions. The August 1912 gathering of non-Bolshevik factions con-\nvoked by Trotski had approved this very slogan. 71 \nThe replies of Lenin's opponents have fallen into undeserved \nneglect. 74 \nAt all events Zhordania, rightly impugned Lenin in 1913 for trying \nto terminate debate before discussions had run their course. Moreover, he knew that most leading Bolshevik \ntheorists sympathised with Luxemburg's analysis. 77 Lenin could not afford not to \nengage them in an exchange of opinions. 82 He avoided repeatedly both outright support for \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand outright opposition to Finnish, Polish and Ukrainian indepen-\ndence.84 Alone of leading \nBolshevik theorists, Stalin came to Lenin's assistance before the \n1914-1918 war.85 Indeed, Stalin provided easily the most compre-\nhensive Bolshevik analysis of the national question.86 And yet even Stalin, writing in Enlightenment \nfrom March 1913 onwards, was more eager to excoriate the Bund \nthan to argue the positive case for Lenin's policy. 90 Secondly, Lenin firmly rejected \nfederalism in all its guises.93 \nSCANDALS \nLenin none the less continued to exude exceptional self-confidence. He welcomed Bauman \nenthusiastically as a future Bolshevik, using his services as a \ntroublemaker from the floor at the Second Party Congress. 96 \nThe choice of an undesirable personage such as Bauman as not \nonly an acceptable but even a respected associate boded ill for the \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbehaviour of Bolsheviks when (as, admittedly, hardly seemed very \nlikely before the First World War) they took power in Russia. This was part and parcel of his \nsupport for the armed robberies conducted by Bolsheviks in the \nRussian empire in 1906-9 as well as his condoning of the marriage of \nBolsheviks A. In 1914, furthermore, it \nbecame abundantly clear that Lenin's prudence could not be taken \nfor granted; and it was not Stalin but a more pressing evil, R. Malinovski, Central Committee \nmember and Bolshevik spokesman in the State Duma, vanished from \nSt Petersburg in mid-May. \nLenin had spurned them as a slur on Malinovski and an attempt \nto sow dissension among Bolsheviks loyal to him. But in 1912 the young Bolshevik theorist \nNikolai Bukharin arrived in Krakow. 100 Bukharin plainly meant \nLenin well, and Lenin was pleased to welcome a comrade who \nregarded himself as a 'pupil'; but Bukharin was convinced that the \nstories about Malinovski and his undercover role for the Okhrana \nwere accurate. He was \nbetter off than his Duma stipend permitted; he enthusiastically \nbacked Lenin's schismatic schemes among Bolsheviks even in that \nfirst year after the Prague Conference when other pro-Lenin \nBolshevik leaders, such as Stalin, were loathe to endorse them \nwithout qualification; and arrests of comrades were made which \nwere only explicable either by boundless ill-luck or by the existence of \na highly-placed police agent: nobody seriously suspected Lenin, \nZinoviev or Kamenev. 103 \nEven when Malinovski absconded in 1914, Lenin refused to \nacknowledge reality. Again, in 1913, Lenin had written to Kamenev: \n'We have suffered some heavy arrests.' 105 To have recognised Malinovski for \nwhat he was would have led to a bout of self-reproach which was not \ncongenial to Lenin. Malinovski had been the \nBolshevik chiefs eyes, ears and even mouth in Russia. Duma deputy G. \nA telegram was sent from Krakow adjuring the Bolshevik Duma \nfraction not 'to get nervous'; its members were asked to refrain from \nexpelling Malinovski from the fraction. \nYet Malinovski had retained credence in his ability to delude \nLenin. 111 Lenin, judging by his dismissive remarks about \nBukharin's being 'credulous about gossip' in 1916, 112 continued to \nfeel that the entire affair was a provocation concocted by as yet \nunidentified enemies of Bolshevism; he even wrote to Malinovski, \nafter he fell into German captivity in the war, in pursuit of further \ncollaboration. 114 \nThe Bolshevik I. \nEvidently Lenin was no less ambiguous about it than was Marx.129 Lenin was content. Lenin, having failed \nto be disconcerted by Hilferding and Radek, was annoyed with \nLuxemburg. Lenin \nand Krupskaya rented a succession of apartments in central and \neastern Europe in streets where the neighbours had no idea of \nBolshevik politics and, as likely as not, would not have cared to \nacquire one either. Lenin attended Bureau sessions in \nthe autumns of 1908 and 1909. This tranquillity started to come to an end with the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, which reunited the \nfactional leaderships of Russian social-democracy and turned over \nthe disputed funds from the legacy of N. All \nthree were prominent figures in the Socialist International, and their \ndeliberations about Russian social-democratic finances dragged the \nISB into the morass of Bolshevik-Menshevik disputes. 159 \nNot approving of the outbreak of peace with the Mensheviks at the \nJanuary 1910 plenum, Lenin felt uneasy about what the arbitrators \nmight do with the money. By November 1910 he was claiming that it \nrightfully belonged only to the Bolsheviks. \nPoletaev, the Bolshevik editor of The Star, to negotiate with Kautsky \nand his two colleagues. Neither \nZetkin nor the other two arbitrators could forget that Lenin wished \nto split the Bolsheviks from the Mensheviks, and that a definitive \nrelease of the money to two separate factions would hasten such a \ndivision. She was unwilling to act unaccompanied \nas an arbitrator and, as Lenin could see, was not averse to supposing \nthat the Bolsheviks had better legal title to the money than the \nMensheviks; 168 but still she declined to take a decision. 171 Bolsheviks G. 172 Lenin sought another lawyer. The \nsnag was that Lenin had entrusted all the original documents to \nDucos's safekeeping, and he perceived that Ducos might refuse to \ngive them up without receiving some compensation for his work. In \nMarch 1913, admitting to his own 'hyper-suspiciousness', Lenin \nrequested Kamenev not to pay out any cheque until he had received \nthe necessary documents. 174 In December 1913, Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. \nLenin's ploy was to accept the invitation to 'a mutual exchange of \nopinions' of the Russian factions while expressing objection to \nKautsky's characterisation of the Russian Social-Democratic La-\nbour Party. He beavered away at the statistics of the votes for \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks at the 1912 State Duma elections and \nat the respective print-run of Bolshevik and Menshevik newspapers. But this would require a barrage of \npreparatory propaganda to convince the ISB that the Bolsheviks \nwere indeed the sole representatives of organised Marxism in the \nRussian empire and that the Mensheviks comprised only a gaggle of \nunattached emigres and anti-party, Russia-based 'Liquidators'. 183 \nRUSSIA IN 1914 \nAnd so, in the first half of 1914, Lenin faced organisational problems \nboth international and Russian. 184 This was another device \nto arrogate legitimacy for the Bolsheviks as the principal constituent \nmembers of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 186 \nThis was characteristic bluff and skulduggery from Lenin. As with \nthe Prague Conference arrangements, various commissions were \nappointed to ensure that Bolsheviks commanded the selection and \nvetting of delegates. 187 Lenin had either learned from Prague or \nbowed to advice from colleagues: a genuine invitation would be \nissued in a timely fashion to the Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians so \nas to avoid the criticisms of his neglect of the non-Russian segments \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof the party in 1912. 189 He highlighted the activity of the \nBolshevik deputies to the Fourth State Duma, and emphasised that \nthe Bolsheviks had swept the board in the workers' constituencies in \nSt Petersburg and Moscow, whereas the Mensheviks had scored \nvictories in more peripheral areas and often through electoral pacts \nwith liberals. Much was also made about the election of Bolshevik \nactivists to trade union boards. His claim, which may have been \nsomewhat exaggerated, was that at least sixteen out of the capital's \ntwenty boards had moved towards the Bolsheviks.191 This was trumpery even by Lenin's standards. These were \nBolshevik slogans, 193 but it is a moot point whether acquaintance \nwith Bolshevism went beyond this or indeed whether most workers \non demonstrations acquired their ideas directly from Bolsheviks. \nPravda editorials; speeches by the Bolshevik Duma deputies; public \nstatements of Bolshevik trade unionists: all these had to be cautiously \nformulated so as not to attract punitive actions by police and censor. \nUnconstrained discussion of Bolshevik ideas occurred only in the \nRussian political underground, in Siberian exile and in the emigra-\ntion. Lenin and Krupskaya had no illusions about the weakness and \nlow morale in the illegal party apparatus. The Moscow \ncomrades talked of 'a complete break-up' of party groups.' 197 The Bolshevik leader was not \nthe only politician to wring his hands. As always, the huge size of many \nfactories and accompanying feelings of 'alienation' among workers \ncreated difficulties; and the appalling environment, with its under-\nprovision of housing and poor sewage and recreational facilities, \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincreased the probability of political crisis. \nLenin recognised this; and, when he was not busy explaining to the \nInternational Socialist Bureau that the Bolsheviks were in better \nshape and had greater support than the Mensheviks, urged his \ncomrades to do their utmost to re-establish the illegal party \napparatus. Krupskaya's notebook continued to acquire names/01 \nbut it was of limited practical use since the police were so skilful in \ncapturing revolutionaries. Signs of vigorous communication between \nthe Central Committee and the Russian political underground are \nfew. In three out of the first six months of 1914, apparently, Lenin \ndid not even write to the Bolshevik Duma deputies; and these \ndeputies, overburdened with Duma activities and other speaking \nand writing engagements, seldom visited him. 203 Dissatisfaction with Lenin was also expressed in \nhis discharge of technical duties.'205 \nBy 1914 Lenin, too, had come to see that his protege Chernoma-\nzov's zest for polemics was causing more harm than good; and that \nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs was being provided with regular \nexcuses to shut down Pravda. Lenin acceded to Chernomazov's \nremoval and was able, because of the shortage of competent \njournalistic talent in the capital, to secure agreement for his \nassociate Kamenev (who no longer had Workers' Newspaper to edit \nin Paris) to take over Pravda's direction in February 1914. Kamenev \nwas also expected to liaise with the Bolshevik Duma deputies as \n Storms Before the Storm \n65 \nFyodor Dan did for the Menshevik deputies. 207 \nNor was the Central Committee as troublesome to Lenin as it once \nhad been. The Bolshevik underground members who had been \nelected at Prague and had objected to his methods - Ordzhoni-\nkidze, Goloshchekin, Spandaryan - had been arrested; and the sole \nCentral Committee member from the Party Mensheviks, D. None of them, with the exception of \nStalin, 209 stood up to Lenin as Ordzhonikidze and his friends had \ndone. The International \nSocialist Bureau's December 1913 decision to invite all factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party to an 'exchange of views' \nmeeting in Brussels lay on the table.210 For some months, Lenin was \nunruffled.212 Things became stickier for Lenin when the Malinovski \nscandal erupted and, as might easily have been predicted, non-\nLeninists in the party were raising a hue and cry about Lenin's \nconvoking his own Party Congress. Lenin felt he was not the faction's ideal spokes-\nman: he would lose his temper and his opponents would have a \nchance to interrogate him. He went on \ncollating information on the respective strengths of the Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the legal labour movement in Russia. Nikiforova took part \nas leading Bolshevik activists in Russia.220 Lenin's subsequent letter to Bolshevik Duma deputy, \nF. 222 It is impressive that \nthe Bolshevik supreme leadership, which had insisted that the \nMensheviks underrated the revolutionary potential of the working \nclass, sat around on Lenin's veranda in Poronin oblivious of the \ndisorder in St Petersburg.", "Bolshevik_Duplicity_1907": " 9 For the Good of the Cause \nON THE RETREAT \nIf political reactionaries in Russia exaggerated the efficaciousness of \nrepression, it is equally true that the country's liberals (as well as many \nsocialists) underestimated the difficulties that would be posed by the \ninception of a fully democratic order. \nBe that as it may, the clamour of Russian oppositional groups for \nelective, representative government had never been stronger than in \n1906. It was disliked by Bolsheviks, including those like Lenin \nwho had been unhappy about boycotting the Duma elections in the \nfirst instance.9 \nMeanwhile the Bolshevik Centre's activity was focused on the \ntowns. The Centre's leading \nfigures were Bogdanov, Krasin and Lenin. But Lenin, unlike Bogdanov \nand Krasin, was unhappy that the Centre should remain involved in the \norganisation of military training; 12 he knew too that his two colleagues \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \nretained objections to official party policy on participation in the \nSecond State Duma. 14 \nOn the other hand it was not in his interest to drive the Mensheviks \nto break with the Bolsheviks. Lenin called for participation. Lenin's reaction was the same as \nthat of Bogdanov and Krasin. His momentary thoughts of agreements \nwith representatives of liberalism were a thing of the past; he joined all \nthe other Bolsheviks in an anti-Menshevik front. 1s Bolsheviks, though by \nno means all of them, then campaigned to get social-democrats elected \nto the Duma.16 Party work was conducted cauti-\nously; and the environment of repression began to tip the balance of \nsocial-democratic opinion in the Bolsheviks' favour, however margi-\nnally, after the closure of the First State Duma.17 Bolshevik doubts \nabout the Central Committee's higher hopes about parliamentarism \nseemed justified. And Bolsheviks were among them for the \nfirst time; eighteen of the faction's candidates secured election.21 \nPARLIAMENTARISM, THE STATE AND AGRICULTURE \nThe articles produced by Lenin to interpret the developing trends in \nthe Russian empire in 1906-7 make a mixed impression. So much so \nthat both friends and enemies in the party were to accuse him of an \nuncritical willingness to perceive the Russian historical experience as \nthe mere repetition of a German model. The charge that he was a \ncrypto-populist faded somewhat, if not completely; and it is difficult to \naccept many later scholars' judgement that the entirety of his work was \nessentially traditional Russian revolutionism without connection with \nMarxism. He was \nunmoved by Trotski's Results and Prospects, which was published in \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1906;23 he objected equally to the multi-volume studies on con-\ntemporary Russia produced by the Menshevik leadership from 1909 \nonwards.24 He also rejected the general political scenario painted in \nBogdanov's various works (although it was not until the latter half of \n1907 that Lenin engaged his rival in open disagreement at a Party \nConference). Lenin still defended the \nBolshevik refusal to participate in the First State Duma.30 \nIn fact Bogdanov's views were distorted in Lenin's presentation. \nBogdanov fully expected Bolsheviks to enter a Constituent Assembly \nin Russia once a democratic republic has been established; but he \nargued that the Duma was an utterly paltry constitutional body when \ncompared with such a future Assembly or even with the existing \nReichstag. The Russian political situation, moreover, was inherently \nunstable. By \nparticipating in the Duma, Russian social-democrats would help to \n For the Good of the Cause \n161 \nlegitimate the existing political order and fail to concentrate upon \nmobilising the workers and the peasantry into armed action against the \nmonarchy.32 In reply, Lenin agreed that politics in Russia were \nsusceptible of sudden transformation; he, no less than Bogdanov, \nexpected violent political 'breaks' and 'leaps' to take place. Bogdanov, in his turn, declared that \nLenin's tactical shimmyings amounted to a sell-out of Bolshevik \nprogrammatic goals to Menshevism.3s \nThe discussion on parliamentarism was tied to considerations on the \nnature of the Russian state. Until 1905 \ntheir main aim had been to demonstrate that, however unmodern its \ngeneral appearance, the Russian economy had decisively embarked \nupon a course of capitalist development. Russia was a hybrid.3s \nLenin had often in the past referred to the' Asiatism' of Russian \npolitical life, nor did he cease to do so; but he also maintained that the \nRussian state had been greatly altered by 1905.39 This phrase was unacceptable \nto his opponents, Bolshevik and Menshevik. In terms of \nthe long-standing consensus in Russian Marxism, was his standpoint \nnot heresy. Lenin's response drew attention to two matters: German \nhistory and 'Bonapartism'.42 Premier Stoly-\npin, in Lenin's judgement, was introducing such Bonapartism to \nRussia.43 \nLenin's approach shows him not to have been strait-jacketed by the \nprejudices of his colleagues.44 \nThis uncustomary tentativeness may well have stemmed from prob-\n For the Good of the Cause \n163 \nlems of reconciling his view of the post-1905 Russian state with his \nobservations on trends in the peasant economy. Virtually all \nMensheviks wanted to do this through the 'municipalisation' of \nproperty in land, most Bolsheviks through letting the peasants seize it \nfor themselves; and Lenin had his own policy of 'nationalisation'.51 \nIf there was going to be such a challenge, Lenin was the likeliest \nperson to make it. Indeed it was in 1907 that he at last conceded that his early \nwritings had exaggerated the level of Russian capitalist development; \nand that feudalistic practices were stronger than he had once \nimagined.65 All \norganised Marxists in the Russian empire were, for the first time, \nrepresented at a Party Congress. The Bolsheviks detected questions of principle in every item \nproposed by their opponents; and they charged them with disregard \nfor the importance of 'theory' . \nAll but three days of the remainder of the proceedings were given \nover to discussions which in one way or another centred upon the State \nDuma; and Lenin's speeches and behind-the-scenes activity showed \nhow deft he was at extracting the maximum political advantage \navailable. Lenin, through tactical astuteness, got as much as \nhe could reasonably have hoped for.71 Bogdanov too \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvolunteered a report, prompting Martov to surmise that his adver-\nsary's task would be to comment on the work of 'another secret \ninstitution'.72 This was a reference to the Bolshevik Centre. As \nevidence of Bolshevik duplicity, Martov noted that Bogdanov, Krasin \nand Lenin had refused to hand over to the Central Committee the sum \nof 60 000 roubles left to the party in the will of the industrialist Savva \nMorozov. The Polish, Latvian and \nBundist delegations found the Bolshevik-Menshevik altercations \ntiresome. Aleksinski, a deputy in \nthe Duma and also a Bolshevik, delivered a hostile co-report;77 and \nLenin dismissed Tsereteli's words as 'the purest revisionism' . \nPlekhanov stirred up further wrangling when he suggested that the \nphilosophical standpoint of Mach and Avenarius, so beloved of many \nBolsheviks, was irreconcilable with Marxism; he also asserted that \nsyndicalist ideas might soon take hold inside the Bolshevik faction.80 \nAgain the Poles and other non-Russian delegates intervened and the \nCongress was hauled forward to its third item: Lenin's report on the \nparty's 'relation to the bourgois parties' .84 \nBut the Bolsheviks obtained strong support from the Congress floor.8s \nTrotski, Luxemburg and Jogiches thought Lenin over-optimistic about \nthe scale of potential assistance from the peasantry; but the Bolsheviks \nthis time stood their ground and, after some vacillation, most Poles \nvoted for the Bolshevik motion.87 Thus the Bolsheviks recorded their \nfirst unqualified victory at the Congress.ss Speaking for the \nBolsheviks, G.s9 \nThe Mensheviks knew that the Bolsheviks would win the resultant \nvote. Why was \nit, they asked, that the Bolsheviks looked upon workers' soviets as \nnothing better than a 'necessary evil'.90 Neither \nBogdanov nor Lenin responded. Bolshevik opposition to Akselrod's \nscheme earned the Congress's approval.91 Lenin also won the day on the \nDuma question. On 18 May \nthe Bolsheviks finally won most of the Latvians and the Poles to their \nside. The Latvians insisted that the Bolsheviks make \nexcisions from their motion, especially the clause justifying the boycott \nof the First Duma. Thus modified, the Bolshevik motion was passed by \nCongress.92 \nDan assailed the Bolshevik leaders as wheeler-dealers: 'And it is \nimpossible by your words to paint over the fact that you were against \nparticipation in the State Duma, and now you're sitting in it' .93 On all \nsides he saw signs of Bolshevik trickery. It had been in \nnear-panic that the delegates attended to three final crucial items of \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness before returning to Russia. They were presented with a joint \nmotion on the trade unions by the Bolsheviks, the Poles and the \nLatvians. Five were Bolsheviks: I. \nRozhkov, I.1Oo The Poles \nwould be useful allies for the Bolsheviks on many issues. It was already crystal-clear that the Bolshevik faction \nwould not be able to do just as it liked in the Central Committee, no \nmore than it had in the stormy proceedings of the Congress. \nSTOL YPIN'S COUP \nNo Fifth Congress delegate, not even highly circumspect ones like \nLenin, had elaborated a policy for the contingency that the emperor \nmight again dissolve the Duma. And the ethnically Russian sections of the \npopulation were to be accorded a disproportionately large number of \nDuma seats; the rebellious non-Russian nationalities were to be \nunder-represented. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party mustered \nonly nineteen places. l03 \nMost Bolshevik leaders had called for a boycott, pressing their case \nat an emergency Party Conference in the Finnish town of Kotka on 21 \nJuly. Lenin therefore held the ring between Bogdanov and Dan. l07 \nLenin's 'centrist' resolution was victorious at the Party Conference. \nAccording to Trotski's estimate, the Russian Social Democratic \nLabour Party's membership dropped from 150 000 in 1907 to 10 000 \nin 1910. \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUnemployment increased. Throughout 1906, Lenin had \navoided exposing himself to the danger of arrest;123 and his caution was \nstrengthened when the Second Duma was suspended in June 1907.125 The Bolshevik \nCentre recognised, even in 1906, the importance of acquiring a safe, \nsecret base.126 There Lenin lived \nwith Bogdanov and Krasin, and the troika had Krupskaya as their \nsecretary. \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nA contract was signed for a multi-volume edition of his works, to be \nentitled Over the Past Twelve Years . It strengthens the impression that Lenin now thought \nof himself as a permanent body in the Russian political firmament.137 His intransigence was \nnot unique among Bolsheviks. But this only encour-\naged the Bolshevik Centre to persist in its kind of behaviour. The \nBolshevik leaders by contrast revelled in a machismo of personal \ninsensitivity in debate. 'I \nheard Lenin', wrote a girl about a conference of St. He fretted about the Central Com-\nmittee and the Bolshevik Centre's far from secure grasp on it. Even \nsharper was his concern about Bogdanov's influence in the Bolshevik \nCentre. Lenin's anti-Kadet \nmotion won the day.142 Yet it did not reflect the attitude of all \nBolsheviks; and many boycottists, having failed to prevent the party's \nelectoral participation, soon began to think of ways to stop the \nBolshevik Duma deputies from attending the Duma. A split between \nLenin and Bogdanov was in the making. \nThat Lenin should contemplate such a break is used by his critics as \nproof of his schismatomania. The Bolsheviks were a mere faction. \nHow could Lenin justify cleaving them into two mini-factions. But it also must be \nappreciated that the State Duma, for him, posed the central immediate \nquestion for Russian social-democracy. Lenin declared: 'Indi-\nvidual parties can hide in the underground, give no sign of themselves, \ndisappear from the political centre-stage; but, at the slightest revivifi-\ncation, the basic political forces will again reveal themselves, perhaps \nin altered form but with the same character and direction of activity, \nuntil the objective problems of a revolution which has suffered this or \nthat defeat have been resolved.' 144 \nSuch thoughts yielded the conclusion that revolutionary leadership \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin times of unfreedom was better undertaken by a few men with correct \ntheory than by many who united around a hotchpotch of incorrect \nideas. In 1907 Lenin was not ready to break with Bogdanov. Petersburg authorities were given \nclues about Lenin's whereabouts by police agents in Paris. Official orders \nwere given to suspend publication of his collected works, and it looked \nmost unlikely that the Bolsheviks would succeed in putting out a party \nnewspaper legally. Lenin became a fugitive. On 12 December 1907 Lenin \njoined the steamer bound for Stockholm; on 21 December, joined at \nlast by Krupskaya, he left Sweden for his second period of emigration \nin Western Europe.", "Clandestine_Party_1909": " It appeared in April 1909. The clandestine party apparatus was to be preserved. Many Mensheviks, led by Potresov, \nargued that the underground party committees had atrophied in \n1907-8 to an extent that made it inappropriate to make them the focal \npoint of social-democratic energies. Potresov did not specifically urge the liquidation of \nclandestine party activity. The Bolsheviks V. Arrests in 1908 had again undermined activity. 10o Lenin was furious. The necessity of keeping clandestine party \ncells was endorsed overwhelmingly.111 Comradely \npersuasion, not administrative sanction, was to be the method used.", "Bolshevik_1909": " 10 \nDoubts and Certainties \nTOWARDS THE BREAK \nThe desire of Russia's political intelligentsia for an integral view on the \nuniverse grew strongly in the nineteenth century. It is striking \nhow eagerly Russian Marxists read the latest research in physics, \npsychology and philosophy. Lenin stoutly \ndefended this tradition. The intellectual's usefulness to Russian society came \nunder question.1 \nLenin reinforced his emphasis upon organisational control and \nideological 'purity'; he discerned no other antidote to the dissolute and \ndissolving conditions he diagnosed. Lenin's campaign against them in the \nCentral Committee was relentless. \n175 \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe involuntary emigration of leaders like himself called for some \ninstitutional re-organisation. Four Bolsheviks were \nparticularly active: Dubrovinski, Goldenberg, Nogin and Rozhkov.3 Bolsheviks exploited their advantage.4 By contrast Social-Democrat, which was intended \nto serve the party as a whole, was reduced by the Bolshevik-Menshevik \nstrife to only fitful publication both then and in the following year. \nWarski expressed growing distaste for the virulence of Bolshevik \nassaults upon adversaries. The Bolsheviks' influence was diminished. \nThis was not to Lenin's liking. But it should not be assumed that \nBolshevik opinion in general took his attitude. There was much, in any \nevent, for the Bolsheviks to be pleased about. By late 1908 they were \ndoing well in local party committees in Russia proper (even though \ntheir record against the Mensheviks in the Ukraine and the Caucasus \nremained less satisfactory).8 \nBut such committees often had little contact with rank-and-file \nmembers; Dan and Martov challenged the Bolsheviks to put their \nposition to the test of a Party Congress. The Bolshevik Centre ignored \nthem, and instructed its representatives in the Central Committee to \nrepudiate the Menshevik request.9 \nYet the Russian social-democrats incurring Lenin's fiercest wrath \nwere found among his own Bolsheviks. lO The strong-\nhold of 'Recallism' was the Moscow region. l2 Maksim Gorki strove to effect a reconcilia-\ntion between Lenin and Bogdanov.13 Unlike \nBogdanov, Lenin for some time refused. The intra-Bolshevik truce \nabout philosophy was to be terminated. Coaxed out to Capri in April \n1908, Lenin rejected any compromise with his former partner; he was \nalso worried lest all Bolsheviks should become branded by Plekhanov \nas renegades from Marxist philosphical 'orthodoxy' by virtue of being \nin the same faction as Bogdanov. Lenin's political views might be seen \nas 'heretical' by the guilt of association with Bogdanov. When Lenin rallied to \nDubrovinski's side, Bogdanov resigned from Proletari (though not \nfrom the Bolshevik Centre) rather than submit to further editorial \nhumiliation.16 First blood to Lenin. \nYet the Bolshevik Centre declined to appoint any of Lenin's \nconfederates in Bogdanov's stead.19 This was too strong for Lenin's taste, but \nnot to the extent that he could not work with Shantser. He resolved to quit the Bolshevik faction altogether \nshould Recallism win a majority in the Centre.20 Meanwhile he plotted \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrategy for the Fifth Party Conference, due to meet in Paris on 21 \nDecember 1908.21 But Lenin was by no means contented. 22 \nLenin would move heaven and earth to get Bogdanov removed from \nthe Bolshevik Centre. \n'MATERIALISM AND EMPIRIOCRITICISM' \nThe product of Lenin's philosophical studies was Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. \nLenin's assault took a year to prepare. It appeared in April 1909. \nLenin's sister Anna, who handled the book's legal publication in \nRussia (under his old nom de plume ofV. \nPlekhanov and Lenin regarded this as anti-Marxist.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders). Marxism, according to \n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPlekhanov and Lenin, held that the universe exists independently of \nhuman perception. Plekhanov, with Lenin's approval, obliged.42 \n Doubts and Certainties \n181 \nLenin's epistemological optimism was extreme.45 Lenin's more \ndefiant opposition to Bogdanov was buttressed by points that were not \nstrictly epistemological. But rather than positions Lenin spoke of \n'parties' . Lenin proceeded to a third point. He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes.53 Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence.54 Lenin hoped to intimidate. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done.65 \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. Here Lenin was pushing his luck. Materialism \ncontained several acidic statements about Plekhanov's works, and \nPlekhanov's friends unsurprisingly replied to Lenin in kind in their \nreviews.66 In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after 1909, Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions.67 Lenin and Plekhanov had no intention of abandoning illegal \nparty activity.71 \nLenin, however, shifted his ground.72 He reportedly \neven toyed with the suggestion to accord voting rights to affiliated \nunions at Party Congresses on a parity with the normal underground \ncommittees;73 But he had second thoughts, perhaps recoiling from a \nplan which would infringe the principle of the party's hegemony of the \nlabour movement (or perhaps simply because he foresaw insuperable \nopposition from his own section of the Bolshevik faction). Lenin's objective \nwas clear. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. The Bolsheviks V.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On 8 February \n1909 Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n1904.75 The battle was on for the Bolshevik Centre. The scene was set \nfor a final confrontation at a meeting of the editorial board of the \nBolshevik newspaper Proletari; all members of the Bolshevik Centre \nwere to be invited.76 \nThe board meeting, lasting from 8 to 17 June, was basically a \nconference of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin proposed a resolution \ncondemning Recallism and Ultimatumism. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin declared: 'There is nothing worse than an absence of open \nstruggle'.77 Recallism and Ultimatum ism were denounced as being \nun-Bolshevik; it was urged that a 'decisive fight' be begun with all such \n'deviations from the path of revolutionary Marxism'. Still moving \nwith Lenin, the meeting approved Dubrovinski's motion seeking an \nalliance with Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin approved. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Petersburg. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. He hinted that such a newspaper would not necessarily \npursue a consistently Bolshevik line. Delegates from Russia felt that \nLenin's editorial policy had given too much space to theoretical \ndisquisitions; they urged the creation of a popular workers' daily.83 This was bad enough for Lenin. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks.84 Lenin's reservations were ignored. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. The Bolshevik leadership chose A. Lyubimov had taken a \nconstant stand against Lenin's divisive tactics.88 He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Lenin could have been forgiven for feeling \nnostalgic about his earlier years in Switzerland. Before 1905 he had \nnot won every political battle inside the Bolshevik fold; but at least he \nhad been in operational control of the faction's emigre team. Apparently the \nBolshevik Centre was finding it difficult to secure parity of editorial \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority over the Viennese Pravda; Lenin urged Lyubimov to stand \nfirm.92 It was Lenin's hope that Trotski would be discouraged from \nfurther co-operation with the Bolsheviks. Nor did Rykov and Goldenberg in Russia.94 \nLenin then exercised the little power left to him in Paris. Krupskaya \nbelonged to the Bolsheviks' Financial Commission, which was respon-\nsible for sending funds to Russia.95 Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June 1909. It occurred, moreover, at a moment \nwhen Lenin's own financial management was coming under scrutiny. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary.97 Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues. Why, they wondered, was he \npersistently calling for a 'war' upon Martov's Mensheviks when \nnobody doubted that Bolshevik influence in the unified central party \napparatus was strong. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. 10o Lenin was furious. Nobody has been able to show that Recallism \nhad more than very slight support in Russia in late 1909; and the \nUltimatumists had in any case never stood very distant from Lenin's \nown attitude to Duma deputies: he had always urged that the \nsocial-democratic fraction comply with Central Committee policies.l04 \nThe Bolshevik Centre set itself the task of pulling the entire \nsocial-democratic movement together under its leadership. Lenin had \nsustained an organisational set-back. Unlike Lenin, \nhe wished to see representatives of all Bolsheviks and all Mensheviks \nworking together in the Central Committee; his other priority was to \nre-establish the Central Committee's organisational presence in \nRussia. Bolshevik leaders in Russia supported him.l07 A meeting of the \nBolshevik Centre was held in Paris on 1 November. Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. Now his own group opposed such \nbehaviour and wanted to re-combine with Martov, albeit in the hope \nthat this would not lead to a significant diminution of Bolshevik \nauthority in the Central Committee. Lenin's tactics were \nakin to those of a general who, receiving reconnaissance information \nthat conditions are unfavourable for an offensive, nevertheless goes \nthrough with it on the grounds that inactivity is bad for the morale of \nthe troops. Lenin had few \ntroops. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' . The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself.113 The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation.114 His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune 1909 was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. \nREPUTATION AND STATURE \nAs we leave Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-Lenin in his fortieth year, after the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, we note that his impact on \nthe party had never been smaller, his prestige never lower. If he had died in 1910, \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. It was tacitly understood that figures like \nPlekhanov, Martov, Maslov, Bogdanov, Trotski and Lenin had earned \nthemselves a position above the rest of the leadership. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n191 \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n1905-6. Of course, all of them were building careers before a very \nrestricted world of observers; no more than a few thousand persons in \nthe Russian empire can have heard of their names and read their \nworks. And it was largely because \nLenin in 1909 continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths.ll7 Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory.ll9 By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n1908-9 accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism.122 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThus what was left of Lenin's positive reputation abroad had come to \nrest upon his ideas and his writings. And, when police files were seized in 1917, the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late 1909 \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted.129 Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after 1905. Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir I1ich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early 1910 was not uniformly sombre. He had to win back his Bolsheviks. and Two Tactics of Russian Social-Democracy \nhad made a durable imprint upon Bolshevism. He had never, not even \nin late 1903, held a monopoly of power in the Bolshevik faction,132 and \nseveral of his strategic aims had persistently been rejected by his \nco-factionalists.133 It is true, too, that several portions of his writing \nmerely summarised general opinion amongst Bolsheviks and were \nbereft of originality. He was full of zeal and \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nresolve.", "Bolshevik_1918": " The Bolsheviks \nwere awesome pioneers in this respect as in many others. The penetration \nof the old 'bourgeois' state by revolutionary means was a declared goal, \nand the Bolshevik party was determined to direct the process. The assumption was that \nworkers, soldiers and peasants would greet the October Revolution by \nparticipating actively in soviets and other sectional organisations. The \nBolshevik party would send its representatives to serve and lead these \norganisations. A departure of men and women from party committees \ninto jobs in the soviets had begun before the seizure of power on 25 \nOctober 1917; afterwards it turned into a mass exodus. Thus Lenin headed \nSovnarkom, and local Bolshevik leaders moved effortlessly into the \nchairmanship of their regional, provincial and urban soviets. 1 \nThis did not bother leading Bolsheviks so long as the Revolution's \ntriumphal advance continued and the party's representatives behaved \n58 \n Only One Year \n59 \nharmoniously. The period had ended by the second half of 1918. \nAlready in January and February, the Brest-Litovsk dispute had \nshaken the complacency of Lenin and his colleagues.3 But it was a straw fluttering in the wind which became \na hurricane when the Soviet regime's resources were thrust on to a war \nfooting after the Czechoslovak Legion's revolt in midsummer 1918. The emergent Soviet state was very ramshackle. \nOld public bodies were retained and headed by Bolsheviks. In 1918, Lenin and his Sovnarkom colleagues \nwere dispatching plenipotentiaries to bring order to food supplies or to \ntransport. Lenin wrote as chairman of Sovnarkom, Sverdlov as \nsecretary of the Party Central Committee or frequently as chairman of \nthe Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of \nSoviets. Trotski was the sole \nBolshevik leader with comparable influence in the latter months of \n1918. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. 11 If Lenin with What is to be Done. There was also a reduction in Moscow. It was all \nvery well for Lenin to be complacent. Local Bolshevik leaders were run ragged by both their \nincreasing duties and the loss of administrators to the Red Army. \nLazar Kaganovich in Nizhni Novgorod and middle-ranking Bolsheviks \nsuch as N. Sapronov in Moscow were prominent \ncritics. 1s \nThis dismissiveness of the matter at hand was no longer possible \nafter Lenin had heard from Stalin and Dzierzysnki. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans. \nLenin had been involved in particular decisions; and some of them, \nsuch as those relating to the Ukrainian Communist Party, had large \nimplications for Bolshevism throughout the old Russian empire. But husband Yakov saw no urgent need for \nreform; and Lenin apparently concluded that, ifSverdlov felt that way, \nthen things must be all right. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov. The choice of the three members confirmed Lenin's \nwillingness to leave such administration to others: Yakov Sverdlov, \nM. On 10 July, after observing the situation around \nthe Volga city ofTsaritsyn, he had cabled to Moscow: 'For the good of \nthe cause, I must have military powers. This is what I'm pushed to do by the interests of the \ncause, and of course the absence of a piece of paper from Trotski won't \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstop me. 'I categorically insist,' he telegrammed to Sverdlov and \nLenin, 'on Stalin's recalt.'33 \nIt was Lenin's convalescence after the attempt on his life that \nbrought Sverdlov into such matters, and Trotski began sending top \ncopies of correspondence to Sverdlov rather than to Lenin.34 Lenin \nwould normally have hated such a loss of personal control, but he was \nreconciled to this temporary condition by Sverdlov's obvious loyalty. This occurred on the railway between \nMoscow and Tsaritsyn, and Sverdlov took the precaution of attending. \nTrotski repeated his objections to Stalin's contravention of policy \ntowards the employment of Imperial officers; he also criticised the \nappointment of inexperienced Bolsheviks such as Kliment Voroshilov \nas Red Amty commanders. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. Avanesov, an associate of Stalin. Okulov fell out with \nVoroshilov in December, and this time Lenin came down on the side of \nTrotski.41 \nThe thing was that Lenin appreciated the advantage of not \nidentifying himself too closely with either Trotski or Stalin. But Lenin, being a committed \noverseer of terror, mostly turned a blind eye. Stalin offered no threat to \nhis primacy among Bolsheviks.42 In 1918 Trotski was by far the greater potential rival. \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHis talent was indisputable. Lenin is said to have commented to him \nafter the October Revolution: 'And what if the White Guards kill you \nand me.'43 It suited Lenin \nadmirably that Trotski had to impose organisation and discipline in the \nRed Army. Lenin, smarting from his mauling in the Brest-Litovsk \ncontroversy, contentedly watched disfavour falling on someone else. Several Bolsheviks who had been prominent \nbefore and even during 1917 failed to cope with the tasks of \ngovernment. But Lenin wished to preserve the leading group in \nplace, and everyone now knew who the main figures were: Lenin, \nTrotski, Stalin, Sverdlov, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Dzierzynski and \nBukharin. This inner core held sway by 1918-1919, and would supply \nthe major players in the struggle to succeed Lenin.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. Only Lenin's premature \ndeath could have so juddered the politics of the Kremlin. Sverdlov and \nLenin had at least tried to make the other leaders work with some \nsemblance of harmony. The Kremlin dyarchy of Lenin and Sverdlov would \nhave been ended in any event. \nLenin anticipated the re-organisation with equanimity. Lenin desired the intermittent \nfractiousness to be replaced by unified action in the Civil War. Lenin and his party were held in quarantine by \nEurope's governments. Lenin was thinking flexibly. On reflection he decided that more harm than good might \nresult at a moment when he and his Central Committee colleagues were \nlaying the ground for a Congress heralded since 1914 in Lenin's \ndeclarations: the inaugurative meeting of the Third Internationa1. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear. But probably Lenin had judged it \nimpossible while the treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be respected on \npain of German military retaliation. s9 \nLenin opened the proceedings on 2 March 1919 by saying: 'In \naccordance with the behest of the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, I am opening the first international communist \ncongress. The difference lent the proceedings a greater implicit \nauthority; and, by referring to his party as the initiator of the \nCongress, he emphasised the special role of the Bolsheviks.61 Lenin had a long record \nof immunity to embarrassment about such dodges.62 Lenin in turn was both exigent and conciliatory. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The revolutionary grouping in \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFrance had fewer than a dozen members. The remainder were \nalready resident in Moscow; it was laughable to pretend that such \npersons were not under the control, direct or not, of the Bolsheviks: \nseveral were Bolshevik party members. The contradictions of the \nrecords and memoirs of the next two days of consultations indicate the \nskullduggery at play; loyal Bolsheviks, then and later, wanted to \nsanitise the dirty work. The Bolsheviks by then had their tails \nup. Nothing in the theses was novel for Russia since October 1917; but \nLenin sketched ideas which, for the West, were highly unusual. Lenin had \nmade the decisive achievement in founding his own International, and \nwisely refrained from pushing the Bolshevik demands too hard. Nor did Lenin discuss the role of the party. 71 On 5 March, Zinoviev's resolution on the Berne conference \nresumed the attack on Kautskyism, retailing the Bolshevik version of \nthe inter-socialist controversies about the Great War and asserting that \nthe Second International currently gave 'service to international \nreaction'.73 \nTrotski rounded off the Bolshevik contribution with a draft \nmanifesto which summarised the deliberations at the Congress in \ntypically vivid and compelling language. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).75 Lenin, having opened the Congress modestly, closed it in \nsimilar vein. At hand is the foundation of an international Soviet \nrepublic.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Lenin, especially after \nSverdlov's untimely death, was blamed for failing to co-ordinate the \ncivilian party apparatus; Trotski was castigated for co-ordinating the \narmed forces to the detriment of party traditions and personnel. The leading Bolshevik in \nNizhni Novgorod, Lazar Kaganovich, insisted that organisational \n Only One Year \n73 \nreforms had not been carried far enough.78 He \nappeared to be unaware that Lenin and Sverdlov had already initiated \nsuch a system.80 \nNo wonder Kaganovich later became a crony of Iosif Stalin.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. Authoritarianism, they claimed, \ndeprived the Bolsheviks of the organisational dynamism that had \nserved them well in the October Revolution. A sense had been growing in late 1918 that the so-called \nduumvirate of Lenin and Sverdlov had to be brought to an end. \nLenin's prestige, as well as sympathy for him as he convalesced, \nprotected him from direct criticism. No one felt \nthat Lenin did not work hard. Nor could there be any suspicion that \nSovnarkom would be more efficiently organised under someone other \nthan Lenin. 84 \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe figure of Trotski by contrast evoked outright resentment. His \nearly anti-Bolshevik career had led many to demur at his recruitment to \nthe party in mid-1917.86 While no one questioned Lenin's sincerity, Trotski came \nwidely under suspicion as the cuckoo in the Bolshevik nest. Trotski admitted in 1919 \nthat 'Bonapartism' might arise in the revolutionary army; but the more \nacute danger to the Soviet state, he averred, stemmed from Bolsheviks \nin the armed forces who were incompetent or obstructive. Lenin did not disavow Trotski's policy; on the \ncontrary, he spoke several times in the winter of 1918-1919 in favour of \nthe enlistment of 'bourgeois specialists' in the Red Army. Apparently it came as a surprise to \nLenin to learn that the Reds had had to induct no fewer than thirty \nthousand Imperial officers in order to keep armed forces of any kind in \nthe field. Thereafter, according to Trotski, Lenin supported Trotski.91 \nAs late as 13 March, however, Lenin avoided antagonising Trotski's \ncritics and referred to them at a meeting in Petrograd as 'belonging to \nthe numbers of the most dedicated and convinced Bolshevik-\nCommunists'.93 On 14 March, still not having departed for the front, \nTrotski chanced his arm by getting the Central Committee to agree to \nprohibit leading Bolsheviks in the Red Army from attending the \nCongress unless a special request were to be made. Sergei Minin, who had befriended \nStalin in Tsaritsyn in mid-1918, was the most prominent such \nindividual. Lenin would not have made the same \nmistake. \nLenin delivered a eulogy of the late Yakov Sverdlov. International relations had dominated the \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprevious Party Congress, and most party officials had been swept into \nmilitary work in subsequent months. \nLenin was curt with refusals to serve on such bodies: 'You can't \ndecline, comrade Muranov. Bolsheviks applauded thunderously. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants. Lenin remarked: 'Organisational activity \nhas never been a strong side of Russians in general and Bolsheviks in \nparticular, and meanwhile the main task of the proletarian revolution is \nprecisely an organisational task. 111 Lenin was spared a \nfurther bruising by the lateness of the hour, by his prestige and by the \nCongress's knowledge that the mastermind of the Secretariat, Yakov \nSverdlov, was no longer alive to answer the accusations. But \nhis inoffensiveness was not reciprocated: Lenin breathed fire and \nbrimstone in his complementary report. But Lenin was a master of \nrhetorical distraction. He acknowledged that 'a decree has not yet been \nissued for all countries to live by the Bolshevik revolutionary calendar', \nbut insisted that the prospect of European revolution had not \nvanished. Georgi \nPyatakov, Lenin's oldest Bolshevik opponent on the national question, \nattacked him. Finnish independence, granted by Lenin to Svinhufvud \nin December 1917, was castigated as a fiasco. 123 Only Central Committee colleague Aleksei Rykov supported \nLenin unequivocally. 124 Lenin, of course, did not intend to facilitate \ndemands for separation from Russia by non-Russian nations. As Lenin put \nit, 'Come across any communist and you'll discover a Great Russian \nchauvinist. 135 Lenin \ndetermined to stay clear of the dispute if at all possible. Okulov, another of Trotski's staff, \ncondemned the Bolshevik leaders on the Southern front who had \nnotoriously imprisoned 'military specialists' on a river barge rather \nthan admit them into their forces. \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nYet his disagreements with Lenin were evident.140 Lenin waded in. Lenin \nrevealed that the Bolsheviks on the Southern front had lost 60,000 men \nin battles against forces which were numerically inferior by far. Trotski's name had to be \ncleared, and Lenin did this without compunction. Osinski in \nparticular had claimed that, while Lenin and Sverdlov had been \nacting as the Central Committee, there had been 'no political line'.150 Osinski, retorting \nthat Lenin himself had admitted that 'personal politics' had been \ndeveloping, focussed on the bureaucratic phenomena in party and \ngovernment and demanded a return to the elective principle. 151 Sapronov \nsupported him: he complained that too many abuses of power were \nreversible only by face-to-face pleadings with Lenin, who would then \nintervene directly. A Soviet republic had been proclaimed in Budapest. Lenin could claim that it indicated a \ncommitment to self-determination, Bukharin that the reference to \nunequal rights was not applicable in the areas under the party's control \n(since the Soviet Constitution guaranteed national equality). 161 But Sokolnikov had been compelled to make \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfurther concessions. Lenin understood this; \nTrotski did not. But even Lenin failed to follow things as closely as he \nhad needed. Among the speakers, a certain \nPanfilov criticised Lenin's pessimism and especially recommended \ncollectivisation for the prosperous agricultural communities of \nUkraine. 168 Lenin had not been without support, 169 but had had to \nspeak robustly to bend the commission his way. '172 The \nHungarian socialist revolution pointed the way to the future.176 There was a discreet abandonment \nof the idea, as proposed by Lenin in 1917, that workers and poor \npeasants would jointly rule Russia. 178 \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRevolutionary wars could be anticipated as the struggle between \nsocialism and capitalism intensified. The \npriority, in Lenin's words, was to 'attain a further rapprochement of \nthe organs of power with the labouring masses'. Lenin's original draft had been written in the heat of the \ncontroversy between Trotski and the Military Opposition, and had \navoided mention of the Red Army. 192 Lenin managed to effect a blend \nof clear intention and reassuring rhetoric which he had failed to obtain \non the national question. Thus 'a struggle against the \nbureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of Soviet power' would \nbe waged. The Soviet regime begged \nfor the support of the so-called labouring masses. Eulogies of revolutionary justice, \nallowing the Bolsheviks and their supporters to feel unrestricted even \nby their own legislation, marked out a strategy for the party in the \npost-war epoch.

The controversy about the trade unions raged \nthrough the New Year in public. \nTHE 'TRADE UNION DISCUSSION' \nIt had taken the crisis among the party leaders for the Central \nCommittee to resume its importance.

A \nPolitburo decision was taken on 28 January 1921 enjoining Trotski and \nZinoviev, who were on an investigatory mission for the Council of \nLabour and Defence in the Urals, to relegate questions about the trade \nunions to the background.'59 \nIn addition, Lenin planned to call a meeting of all those who agreed \nwith him on the trade unions. It was his contention that the strict line on the trade unions \naccepted by Lenin at the previous Party Congress was responsible for \nstimulating working-class discontent. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin.199 \nAt session twelve, on 14 March, Zinoviev opened the debate on the \nsubject which had engaged party leaders in previous months: the trade \nunions.

The country's \nMarxists inherited a commitment to science and rationalism. It is striking \nhow eagerly Russian Marxists read the latest research in physics, \npsychology and philosophy. Lenin stoutly \ndefended this tradition. The intellectual's usefulness to Russian society came \nunder question. A group of liberal conservatives, former \nMarxists and religious mystics combined in 1909 to produce Land-\nmarks, a book which urged intellectuals to abstain from politics and \nconcentrate upon their individual moral self-perfection.1 \nLenin reinforced his emphasis upon organisational control and \nideological 'purity'; he discerned no other antidote to the dissolute and \ndissolving conditions he diagnosed. Lenin's campaign against them in the \nCentral Committee was relentless. \n175 \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe involuntary emigration of leaders like himself called for some \ninstitutional re-organisation. Four Bolsheviks were \nparticularly active: Dubrovinski, Goldenberg, Nogin and Rozhkov.3 Bolsheviks exploited their advantage.4 By contrast Social-Democrat, which was intended \nto serve the party as a whole, was reduced by the Bolshevik-Menshevik \nstrife to only fitful publication both then and in the following year. \nWarski expressed growing distaste for the virulence of Bolshevik \nassaults upon adversaries. The Bolsheviks' influence was diminished. \nThis was not to Lenin's liking. But it should not be assumed that \nBolshevik opinion in general took his attitude. There was much, in any \nevent, for the Bolsheviks to be pleased about. By late 1908 they were \ndoing well in local party committees in Russia proper (even though \ntheir record against the Mensheviks in the Ukraine and the Caucasus \nremained less satisfactory).8 \nBut such committees often had little contact with rank-and-file \nmembers; Dan and Martov challenged the Bolsheviks to put their \nposition to the test of a Party Congress. The Bolshevik Centre ignored \nthem, and instructed its representatives in the Central Committee to \nrepudiate the Menshevik request.9 \nYet the Russian social-democrats incurring Lenin's fiercest wrath \nwere found among his own Bolsheviks. lO The strong-\nhold of 'Recallism' was the Moscow region. l2 Maksim Gorki strove to effect a reconcilia-\ntion between Lenin and Bogdanov.13 Unlike \nBogdanov, Lenin for some time refused. Lenin and Bogdanov, with Dubrov-\ninski, were Proletari's editors. Ignoring Gorki's peace-making \ngestures, Lenin made clear that he would shortly engage in an attack \nupon Bogdanov's philosophical writings. The intra-Bolshevik truce \nabout philosophy was to be terminated. Coaxed out to Capri in April \n1908, Lenin rejected any compromise with his former partner; he was \nalso worried lest all Bolsheviks should become branded by Plekhanov \nas renegades from Marxist philosphical 'orthodoxy' by virtue of being \nin the same faction as Bogdanov. Lenin's political views might be seen \nas 'heretical' by the guilt of association with Bogdanov. When Lenin rallied to \nDubrovinski's side, Bogdanov resigned from Proletari (though not \nfrom the Bolshevik Centre) rather than submit to further editorial \nhumiliation.16 First blood to Lenin. \nYet the Bolshevik Centre declined to appoint any of Lenin's \nconfederates in Bogdanov's stead.19 This was too strong for Lenin's taste, but \nnot to the extent that he could not work with Shantser. He resolved to quit the Bolshevik faction altogether \nshould Recallism win a majority in the Centre.20 Meanwhile he plotted \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrategy for the Fifth Party Conference, due to meet in Paris on 21 \nDecember 1908. RecaIlists and Ultimatumists could muster only a \nhandful of votes; and again it was Lenin's 'centrist' motion that \nwilly-nilly won their support as being at least better than that of the \nMensheviks.21 But Lenin was by no means contented. 22 \nLenin would move heaven and earth to get Bogdanov removed from \nthe Bolshevik Centre. \n'MATERIALISM AND EMPIRIOCRITICISM' \nThe product of Lenin's philosophical studies was Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. \nLenin's assault took a year to prepare. \nPlekhanov and Lenin regarded this as anti-Marxist.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders). Marxism, according to \n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPlekhanov and Lenin, held that the universe exists independently of \nhuman perception. Plekhanov, with Lenin's approval, obliged. Views on the question of \nthe independent existence of the external world still differ; but Lenin's \nattitude undoubtedly has strong current backing.42 \n Doubts and Certainties \n181 \nLenin's epistemological optimism was extreme.44 Lenin thought \nPlekhanov to have introduced an unnecessarily indeterminate factor.45 Lenin's more \ndefiant opposition to Bogdanov was buttressed by points that were not \nstrictly epistemological. But rather than positions Lenin spoke of \n'parties' . Lenin proceeded to a third point.49 \nFor his part, Lenin stated that Kapital was eternally true.51 In his \ngeneral offensive against Plekhanovite epistemology, he included \nparticular attacks on Lenin. He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes.52 He also tackled Lenin's points on the beliefs \nof scientists, on 'party-mindedness', on religion.53 Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence.54 Lenin hoped to intimidate. The essence of Lenin's position was that Marx's \nwritings were un assail ably true.57 \nEvidently these mutual criticisms by Lenin and Bogdanov were not \nmerely about cognitive psychology. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. The veracity of an idea, asserted \nLenin, was not increased in proportion to the rise in the number of \npersons believing it.6a \nLenin saw Bogdanov's case as an unwarranted attack upon the \nintelligentsia (even though he himself had had harsh words about it in \nthe past); he also had a higher regard for the scientific and cultural \nachievements of capitalism than Bogdanov. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done.65 \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. Here Lenin was pushing his luck. Materialism \ncontained several acidic statements about Plekhanov's works, and \nPlekhanov's friends unsurprisingly replied to Lenin in kind in their \nreviews.66 In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after 1909, Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions.67 Lenin and Plekhanov had no intention of abandoning illegal \nparty activity. Many Mensheviks, led by Potresov, \nargued that the underground party committees had atrophied in \n1907-8 to an extent that made it inappropriate to make them the focal \npoint of social-democratic energies.68 The niceties of this policy did \nnot interest Lenin and Plekhanov. \nNeither Lenin nor Plekhanov ceased to object to each other's \n Doubts and Certainties \n185 \nprogrammatic intentions in other areas.71 \nLenin, however, shifted his ground.72 He reportedly \neven toyed with the suggestion to accord voting rights to affiliated \nunions at Party Congresses on a parity with the normal underground \ncommittees;73 But he had second thoughts, perhaps recoiling from a \nplan which would infringe the principle of the party's hegemony of the \nlabour movement (or perhaps simply because he foresaw insuperable \nopposition from his own section of the Bolshevik faction). Lenin's objective \nwas clear. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. The Bolsheviks V.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On 8 February \n1909 Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n1904.75 The battle was on for the Bolshevik Centre. The scene was set \nfor a final confrontation at a meeting of the editorial board of the \nBolshevik newspaper Proletari; all members of the Bolshevik Centre \nwere to be invited.76 \nThe board meeting, lasting from 8 to 17 June, was basically a \nconference of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin proposed a resolution \ncondemning Recallism and Ultimatumism. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin declared: 'There is nothing worse than an absence of open \nstruggle'.77 Recallism and Ultimatum ism were denounced as being \nun-Bolshevik; it was urged that a 'decisive fight' be begun with all such \n'deviations from the path of revolutionary Marxism'. Still moving \nwith Lenin, the meeting approved Dubrovinski's motion seeking an \nalliance with Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin approved.80 \nHe liked the implication that Bogdanov's real influence over party \ncommittees in Russia had never been great enough to threaten a split. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Petersburg. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. He hinted that such a newspaper would not necessarily \npursue a consistently Bolshevik line. Delegates from Russia felt that \nLenin's editorial policy had given too much space to theoretical \ndisquisitions; they urged the creation of a popular workers' daily.83 This was bad enough for Lenin. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks.84 Lenin's reservations were ignored. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments.86 \nNot only was this an implicit indication to Lenin that certain of his \nbasic tactical recommendations were unacceptable. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. The Bolshevik leadership chose A. Lyubimov had taken a \nconstant stand against Lenin's divisive tactics.88 He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Lenin could have been forgiven for feeling \nnostalgic about his earlier years in Switzerland. Before 1905 he had \nnot won every political battle inside the Bolshevik fold; but at least he \nhad been in operational control of the faction's emigre team. Apparently the \nBolshevik Centre was finding it difficult to secure parity of editorial \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority over the Viennese Pravda; Lenin urged Lyubimov to stand \nfirm.92 It was Lenin's hope that Trotski would be discouraged from \nfurther co-operation with the Bolsheviks.94 \nLenin then exercised the little power left to him in Paris. Krupskaya \nbelonged to the Bolsheviks' Financial Commission, which was respon-\nsible for sending funds to Russia.95 Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June 1909. It occurred, moreover, at a moment \nwhen Lenin's own financial management was coming under scrutiny. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary.97 Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues. Why, they wondered, was he \npersistently calling for a 'war' upon Martov's Mensheviks when \nnobody doubted that Bolshevik influence in the unified central party \napparatus was strong. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. 10o Lenin was furious. Nobody has been able to show that Recallism \nhad more than very slight support in Russia in late 1909; and the \nUltimatumists had in any case never stood very distant from Lenin's \nown attitude to Duma deputies: he had always urged that the \nsocial-democratic fraction comply with Central Committee policies.l03 Apparently such views were \nheld widely across the Russian empire.l04 \nThe Bolshevik Centre set itself the task of pulling the entire \nsocial-democratic movement together under its leadership. Lenin had \nsustained an organisational set-back. Unlike Lenin, \nhe wished to see representatives of all Bolsheviks and all Mensheviks \nworking together in the Central Committee; his other priority was to \nre-establish the Central Committee's organisational presence in \nRussia. Bolshevik leaders in Russia supported him.l07 A meeting of the \nBolshevik Centre was held in Paris on 1 November. Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. \nThroughout 1909 he had behaved as if only his group inside \nBolshevism and Plekhanov's inside Menshevism were legitimate \nconstituent elements of the party. Now his own group opposed such \nbehaviour and wanted to re-combine with Martov, albeit in the hope \nthat this would not lead to a significant diminution of Bolshevik \nauthority in the Central Committee. Lenin's tactics were \nakin to those of a general who, receiving reconnaissance information \nthat conditions are unfavourable for an offensive, nevertheless goes \nthrough with it on the grounds that inactivity is bad for the morale of \nthe troops. Lenin had few \ntroops. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' .111 Comradely \npersuasion, not administrative sanction, was to be the method used. The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself.113 The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation.114 His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune 1909 was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. \nREPUTATION AND STATURE \nAs we leave Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-Lenin in his fortieth year, after the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, we note that his impact on \nthe party had never been smaller, his prestige never lower. If he had died in 1910, \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. It was tacitly understood that figures like \nPlekhanov, Martov, Maslov, Bogdanov, Trotski and Lenin had earned \nthemselves a position above the rest of the leadership. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n191 \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n1905-6. And it was largely because \nLenin in 1909 continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths.ll7 Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory. Lenin, it had been \nsaid, was quintessentially a 'voluntarist' who would not recognise \nenvironmental constraints.ll9 By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n1908-9 accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism.122 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThus what was left of Lenin's positive reputation abroad had come to \nrest upon his ideas and his writings. And, when police files were seized in 1917, the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late 1909 \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). It is \naltogether remarkable how little material has been produced to \ndemonstrate that elements in the Russian party continued to hold him \ncomprehensively in esteem as a practical leader.126 \nThis fall-off in the appreciation of his qualities irritated Lenin, but \ndid not crush him. \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted.129 Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after 1905. Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir I1ich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early 1910 was not uniformly sombre. He had to win back his Bolsheviks. and Two Tactics of Russian Social-Democracy \nhad made a durable imprint upon Bolshevism.

Why, they wondered, was he \npersistently calling for a 'war' upon Martov's Mensheviks when \nnobody doubted that Bolshevik influence in the unified central party \napparatus was strong. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. 10o Lenin was furious.

It appeared in April 1909. \nPlekhanov and Lenin regarded this as anti-Marxist.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders).

He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes.53 Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence.54 Lenin hoped to intimidate.57 \nEvidently these mutual criticisms by Lenin and Bogdanov were not \nmerely about cognitive psychology. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. The veracity of an idea, asserted \nLenin, was not increased in proportion to the rise in the number of \npersons believing it. Through the doctrines of Marx and \nEngels, according to Lenin, the party could explain reality to the \nmasses and win them over to the revolutionary cause.6a \nLenin saw Bogdanov's case as an unwarranted attack upon the \nintelligentsia (even though he himself had had harsh words about it in \nthe past); he also had a higher regard for the scientific and cultural \nachievements of capitalism than Bogdanov. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done.65 \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. Here Lenin was pushing his luck. Materialism \ncontained several acidic statements about Plekhanov's works, and \nPlekhanov's friends unsurprisingly replied to Lenin in kind in their \nreviews.66 In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after 1909, Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions.67 Lenin and Plekhanov had no intention of abandoning illegal \nparty activity. Many Mensheviks, led by Potresov, \nargued that the underground party committees had atrophied in \n1907-8 to an extent that made it inappropriate to make them the focal \npoint of social-democratic energies.68 The niceties of this policy did \nnot interest Lenin and Plekhanov.71 \nLenin, however, shifted his ground.72 He reportedly \neven toyed with the suggestion to accord voting rights to affiliated \nunions at Party Congresses on a parity with the normal underground \ncommittees;73 But he had second thoughts, perhaps recoiling from a \nplan which would infringe the principle of the party's hegemony of the \nlabour movement (or perhaps simply because he foresaw insuperable \nopposition from his own section of the Bolshevik faction). Lenin's objective \nwas clear. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. He had left \nhundreds of thousands of roubles for disbursal to organisations \nsupporting the cause of revolution in Russia; his two sisters were to \nsupervise the distribution. The Bolsheviks V.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On 8 February \n1909 Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n1904.75 The battle was on for the Bolshevik Centre.

Still moving \nwith Lenin, the meeting approved Dubrovinski's motion seeking an \nalliance with Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin approved.80 \nHe liked the implication that Bogdanov's real influence over party \ncommittees in Russia had never been great enough to threaten a split. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Petersburg. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. He hinted that such a newspaper would not necessarily \npursue a consistently Bolshevik line. Delegates from Russia felt that \nLenin's editorial policy had given too much space to theoretical \ndisquisitions; they urged the creation of a popular workers' daily.83 This was bad enough for Lenin. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments.86 \nNot only was this an implicit indication to Lenin that certain of his \nbasic tactical recommendations were unacceptable. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. The Bolshevik leadership chose A. Lyubimov had taken a \nconstant stand against Lenin's divisive tactics.88 He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Before 1905 he had \nnot won every political battle inside the Bolshevik fold; but at least he \nhad been in operational control of the faction's emigre team.

Krupskaya \nbelonged to the Bolsheviks' Financial Commission, which was respon-\nsible for sending funds to Russia.95 Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June 1909. It occurred, moreover, at a moment \nwhen Lenin's own financial management was coming under scrutiny. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary.97 Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues.

Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. \nThroughout 1909 he had behaved as if only his group inside \nBolshevism and Plekhanov's inside Menshevism were legitimate \nconstituent elements of the party. Now his own group opposed such \nbehaviour and wanted to re-combine with Martov, albeit in the hope \nthat this would not lead to a significant diminution of Bolshevik \nauthority in the Central Committee. Lenin's tactics were \nakin to those of a general who, receiving reconnaissance information \nthat conditions are unfavourable for an offensive, nevertheless goes \nthrough with it on the grounds that inactivity is bad for the morale of \nthe troops. Lenin had few \ntroops. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' .111 Comradely \npersuasion, not administrative sanction, was to be the method used. The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself.113 The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation.114 His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune 1909 was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. \nREPUTATION AND STATURE \nAs we leave Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-Lenin in his fortieth year, after the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, we note that his impact on \nthe party had never been smaller, his prestige never lower. If he had died in 1910, \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. It was tacitly understood that figures like \nPlekhanov, Martov, Maslov, Bogdanov, Trotski and Lenin had earned \nthemselves a position above the rest of the leadership. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n191 \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n1905-6. Of course, all of them were building careers before a very \nrestricted world of observers; no more than a few thousand persons in \nthe Russian empire can have heard of their names and read their \nworks. And it was largely because \nLenin in 1909 continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths.ll7 Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory.ll9 By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n1908-9 accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism.122 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThus what was left of Lenin's positive reputation abroad had come to \nrest upon his ideas and his writings. And, when police files were seized in 1917, the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. But it also meant that activists across Russia were aware of his \ndisruptive role. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late 1909 \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted.129 Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after 1905. Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir I1ich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early 1910 was not uniformly sombre.

Bogdanov had refined \nhis ideas between 1904 and 1906 in his trilogy Empiriomonism. No stylistic means of deriding Bogdanov was neglected. Dispute already raged between Plekhanov and \nBogdanov.

Marx's treatise in Bogdanov's view was not of \neternal validity but, rather, 'an objective truth' for the pre-socialist, \nindustrial societies of the epoch.30 For Bogdanov, ideas were a \npowerful organising 'force'.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders).37 Plekhanov's \ninterpretation of Engels was equally unacceptable to Bogdanov. Nor, for that matter, did Bogdanov address himself to Lenin's \nquotation of Engels on the subject of materialists. Yet Engels was not \nlost to Bogdanov completely. Anti-Diihring, as Bogdanov delighted in \nrepeating, insisted on the relativity of social knowledge. There is justice in Bogdanov's claim to be closer than \nLenin and Plekhanov to Marxian epistemological theory.45 Lenin's more \ndefiant opposition to Bogdanov was buttressed by points that were not \nstrictly epistemological. On the other side stood the party \nof the idealists, and Bogdanov was to be regarded as among its newly \npaid-up members.48 Bogdanov was criticised for \nhaving epistemological opinions remarkably like Lunacharski's. Bogdanov suggested \nthat his opponent had displayed a wholly unscientific, authoritarian \nspirit.55 Bogdanov \npursued the point. \nHow, asked Bogdanov, was it logically possible to reach the infinite by \na finite series of steps.58 Bogdanov \nhad never disowned the connection between his philosophical and \npolitical opinions. Bogdanov did not confine himself to \nanalysing ideologies of the past and the present.6a \nLenin saw Bogdanov's case as an unwarranted attack upon the \nintelligentsia (even though he himself had had harsh words about it in \nthe past); he also had a higher regard for the scientific and cultural \nachievements of capitalism than Bogdanov. We \ncan only hazard guesses as to the reasons; but one possibility must \nsurely come into the reckoning: an attack upon Bogdanov's cultural \nprogramme would only have invited accusations of hostility to the \nnotion of independently-minded workers; he would also be branded as \na devotee of authoritarianism. In fact his self-distancing from \nBogdanov was complemented by moves towards a rapprochement \nwith Plekhanov. It carried him close to \nBogdanovist positions. This necessitated a \nsettling of organisational accounts with Bogdanov. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. And they were facilitated to some extent by the financial \nindependence he at last in 1908 enjoyed from Bogdanov and Krasin.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. It also criticised Bogdanov \nfor planning to set up a school for party workers on the island of Capri. \nBogdanov protested that his views were being misrepresented. Bogdanov's claim did not alter the fact that few \nRecallists or UItimatumists were entering trade unions. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction.80 \nHe liked the implication that Bogdanov's real influence over party \ncommittees in Russia had never been great enough to threaten a split. \nWith the departure of Bogdanov on 12 June, Lenin had won his \nvictory. \nMost delegates, while approving Bogdanov's expulsion from the \nfaction in order to exploit more fully the legal political opportunities in \nRussia, were reluctant to regard the Plekhanovite Party Mensheviks as \ntheir only allies. It was also a \npractical limitation on his activity in the immediate future; he had \ndisengaged himself from Bogdanov only to find himself even more \nclosely controlled by his colleagues than before. Malinovski. Bogdanov would be in attendance \nas a candidate member; and Trotski too would be invited along (in his \ncapacity as editor of Pravda) .

It is striking \nhow eagerly Russian Marxists read the latest research in physics, \npsychology and philosophy. Lenin stoutly \ndefended this tradition. The intellectual's usefulness to Russian society came \nunder question. Lenin's campaign against them in the \nCentral Committee was relentless. \n175 \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe involuntary emigration of leaders like himself called for some \ninstitutional re-organisation. Four Bolsheviks were \nparticularly active: Dubrovinski, Goldenberg, Nogin and Rozhkov.3 Bolsheviks exploited their advantage.4 By contrast Social-Democrat, which was intended \nto serve the party as a whole, was reduced by the Bolshevik-Menshevik \nstrife to only fitful publication both then and in the following year. \nWarski expressed growing distaste for the virulence of Bolshevik \nassaults upon adversaries. The Bolsheviks' influence was diminished. \nThis was not to Lenin's liking. But it should not be assumed that \nBolshevik opinion in general took his attitude. There was much, in any \nevent, for the Bolsheviks to be pleased about.8 \nBut such committees often had little contact with rank-and-file \nmembers; Dan and Martov challenged the Bolsheviks to put their \nposition to the test of a Party Congress. The Bolshevik Centre ignored \nthem, and instructed its representatives in the Central Committee to \nrepudiate the Menshevik request.9 \nYet the Russian social-democrats incurring Lenin's fiercest wrath \nwere found among his own Bolsheviks. lO The strong-\nhold of 'Recallism' was the Moscow region. l2 Maksim Gorki strove to effect a reconcilia-\ntion between Lenin and Bogdanov.13 Unlike \nBogdanov, Lenin for some time refused. The intra-Bolshevik truce \nabout philosophy was to be terminated. Coaxed out to Capri in April \n1908, Lenin rejected any compromise with his former partner; he was \nalso worried lest all Bolsheviks should become branded by Plekhanov \nas renegades from Marxist philosphical 'orthodoxy' by virtue of being \nin the same faction as Bogdanov. Lenin's political views might be seen \nas 'heretical' by the guilt of association with Bogdanov. When Lenin rallied to \nDubrovinski's side, Bogdanov resigned from Proletari (though not \nfrom the Bolshevik Centre) rather than submit to further editorial \nhumiliation.16 First blood to Lenin. \nYet the Bolshevik Centre declined to appoint any of Lenin's \nconfederates in Bogdanov's stead.19 This was too strong for Lenin's taste, but \nnot to the extent that he could not work with Shantser. He resolved to quit the Bolshevik faction altogether \nshould Recallism win a majority in the Centre.21 But Lenin was by no means contented. 22 \nLenin would move heaven and earth to get Bogdanov removed from \nthe Bolshevik Centre. \n'MATERIALISM AND EMPIRIOCRITICISM' \nThe product of Lenin's philosophical studies was Materialism and \nEmpiriocriticism. \nLenin's assault took a year to prepare.33 But Plekhanov and Lenin had other criticisms too (and in \nany case Lenin the polemicist refused to take any notice of Bogdanov's \nrejoinders). Marxism, according to \n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPlekhanov and Lenin, held that the universe exists independently of \nhuman perception. Plekhanov, with Lenin's approval, obliged.42 \n Doubts and Certainties \n181 \nLenin's epistemological optimism was extreme. But rather than positions Lenin spoke of \n'parties' . Lenin proceeded to a third point. He took up Lenin's camera analogy. \nWithout knowing it, Bogdanov teased, Lenin had adopted an \nEmpiriomonist viewpoint through his references to chemically-based \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nphotographic processes.53 Allegedly, Lenin had not shown philosophical competence.54 Lenin hoped to intimidate. Lenin in a single instance dis-\ncussed political implications. He felt that the same was not true of Lenin. \nProbably Lenin wished to avoid the pillorying he had received when he \npublished What Is To Be Done.65 \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRE \nLenin's forays against groups inside the party did not signify that he yet \naimed to abandon all co-operation with those social-democrats who \nwere not his closest supporters. Here Lenin was pushing his luck.66 In addition Materialism, though sincere, was not an exhaus-\n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntive exposition of its author's attitudes to cognition. But in other writings, both \nbefore and after 1909, Lenin had emphasised the need for \nrevolutionaries to take gambles. Lenin had his \ncontradictions. The \ntwo leaders shared a growing concern about trends in the Bolshevik \nand Menshevik factions.71 \nLenin, however, shifted his ground. Lenin's objective \nwas clear. He aimed to win the Bolshevik Centre to his side and force \nBogdanov's exodus. The Bolsheviks V.74 \nAnimosity between Lenin and Bogdanov increased. On 8 February \n1909 Lenin broke off personal relations, ending a friendship begun in \n1904.75 The battle was on for the Bolshevik Centre. The scene was set \nfor a final confrontation at a meeting of the editorial board of the \nBolshevik newspaper Proletari; all members of the Bolshevik Centre \nwere to be invited.76 \nThe board meeting, lasting from 8 to 17 June, was basically a \nconference of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin proposed a resolution \ncondemning Recallism and Ultimatumism. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin declared: 'There is nothing worse than an absence of open \nstruggle'.77 Recallism and Ultimatum ism were denounced as being \nun-Bolshevik; it was urged that a 'decisive fight' be begun with all such \n'deviations from the path of revolutionary Marxism'. Bogdanov \nwas to be driven out of the Bolshevik faction. Lenin approved. The Bolshevik Centre could now quickly complete the \nremaining business. This was in fact a trying time for Lenin. In the \nmoment of his triumph he was to witness the Bolshevik Centre taking \ndecisions which made his organisational position weaker in many ways \nthan it had been before the meeting. Petersburg. Lenin was far \nfrom keen. He hinted that such a newspaper would not necessarily \npursue a consistently Bolshevik line.83 This was bad enough for Lenin. The plan was to persuade Trotski to make Pravda a \njoint venture with the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Centre members operating in Russia were to be \npermitted to take decisions without constant reference to members \nabroad; the 'Russian' party was to be freed from 'foreign' entangle-\nments. \nLENIN'S DEFEAT \nInitially he accepted the position phlegmatically. The Bolshevik leadership chose A.88 He was a leading \nBolshevik Conciliator. Before 1905 he had \nnot won every political battle inside the Bolshevik fold; but at least he \nhad been in operational control of the faction's emigre team. Apparently the \nBolshevik Centre was finding it difficult to secure parity of editorial \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority over the Viennese Pravda; Lenin urged Lyubimov to stand \nfirm.92 It was Lenin's hope that Trotski would be discouraged from \nfurther co-operation with the Bolsheviks.94 \nLenin then exercised the little power left to him in Paris. Krupskaya \nbelonged to the Bolsheviks' Financial Commission, which was respon-\nsible for sending funds to Russia.95 Rykov, in Lenin's view, was in \nbreach of the anti-Liquidator decisions of June 1909. \nThe Mensheviks raised a hue and cry about Lenin's insistence that \nBolsheviks should retain the Shmidt inheritance for their own \nexclusive use even though the deceased man had not specified a single \nfaction as the sole beneficiary.97 Opinion was hardening against Lenin \namong his Bolshevik colleagues. Why, they wondered, was he \npersistently calling for a 'war' upon Martov's Mensheviks when \nnobody doubted that Bolshevik influence in the unified central party \napparatus was strong. In the \nautumn, Lenin submitted an article to the party's central newspaper \nSocial-Democrat calling for a renewed assault upon Recallists and \nLiquidators. 10o Lenin was furious. Nobody has been able to show that Recallism \nhad more than very slight support in Russia in late 1909; and the \nUltimatumists had in any case never stood very distant from Lenin's \nown attitude to Duma deputies: he had always urged that the \nsocial-democratic fraction comply with Central Committee policies.l04 \nThe Bolshevik Centre set itself the task of pulling the entire \nsocial-democratic movement together under its leadership. Lenin had \nsustained an organisational set-back. Unlike Lenin, \nhe wished to see representatives of all Bolsheviks and all Mensheviks \nworking together in the Central Committee; his other priority was to \nre-establish the Central Committee's organisational presence in \nRussia. Bolshevik leaders in Russia supported him.l07 A meeting of the \nBolshevik Centre was held in Paris on 1 November. Lenin appended his signature to the \ndecision. Now his own group opposed such \nbehaviour and wanted to re-combine with Martov, albeit in the hope \nthat this would not lead to a significant diminution of Bolshevik \nauthority in the Central Committee. Lenin had few \ntroops. Yet Lenin's militance \nwas rejected. The plenum accepted an amendment from Trotski to the \neffect that the two 'deviations' should be dealt with by means of a \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'widening and deepening of social-democratic work' . The \nBolshevik Centre was to dissolve itself.113 The \nMensheviks were determined to spare Lenin no humiliation.114 His own Bolsheviks \nwere no less keen on the changes than were Martov, Trotski and \nBogdanov; the turnabout that had occurred in the Bolshevik Centre in \nJune 1909 was being repeated just a few months later in the Central \nCommittee. If he had died in 1910, \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party would have remembered \nhim as something more than just a troublemaker. They knew each other well, having been together in a \n Doubts and Certainties \n191 \nvariety of testing conditions: in clandestine activity in Russia, in the \ncommunity of emigration, and in the semi-open politics of Russia in \n1905-6. And it was largely because \nLenin in 1909 continued to propose the dissolution of the family that \nhis fellow leaders queried whether he deserved their esteem any \nlonger. \nThe decline in Lenin's reputation by no means plumbed the lowest \npossible depths.ll7 Bolshevik \nConciliators, moreover, did not disown his writings on political theory.ll9 By contrast, left-wing Bolsheviks in \n1908-9 accused him of the diametrical opposite: historical fatalism. And, when police files were seized in 1917, the \nrecord of arrests of social-democratic groups indicated that Lenin's \nmajor works were widely known. Goloshchekin, a Bolshevik who opposed Bog-\ndanov's attitude to the Duma, wrote from St. Petersburg in late 1909 \nimploring the emigres to terminate disputes about Recallism (which, \nhe suggested, was withering on the vine in Russia without need of \nartificial poison). \nBut he usually refrained from angry public outbursts; Vladimir \nMedem, a member of the Bund and no friend of the Bolsheviks, was \namazed by Lenin's capacity to remain impassive when being haran-\ngued or insulted.129 Lenin's passion was poured into his politics. Relations between him and Lenin had \nworsened after 1905. Yet Lunacharski could write, in self-\ncongratulation, about a conversation with Lenin: 'He is terribly \nsatisfied with me. \nAnd so the vista of opportunities perceived by Vladimir I1ich \nUlyanov-Lenin in early 1910 was not uniformly sombre.

Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag.

In addition, Russian foreign policy from the 1890s moved \ncloser towards the embrace of the French. Russian fears about Germany were complemented by \nGerman fears about Russia. German army leaders advised that the \nachievements of Russian industrial development were such that, if \nGermany's security was to be guaranteed, Russian power had to be \ndestroyed by a pre-emptive war. \nBy 1914, the Russian emperor judged that his country's prestige \nand geopolitical interest in the Balkans were at stake.

Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.

He was the second son of Ilya Nikolaevich and \nMariya Aleksandrovna Ulyanov. In 1869, a year before Vladimir's \nbirth, Ilya had been appointed as schools inspector for the province of \nSimbirsk. His \nfather, Nikolai Ulyanov, was a tailor. It is uncertain whether he was Russian or Kalmyk or \nTartar; and the truth is unlikely to emerge so long as the Soviet \nauthorities are embarrassed about data thought to detract from the \n'Russianness' of Lenin.

The combination of scholarly \naccomplishment and political eminence was not a uniquely Russian \nphenomenon. Books on history, \nphilosophy and economics were therefore popular with the Russian \nreading public. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia. Each \n65 \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nchapter contains lengthy sections written in a style characteristic of \nacademic treatises; but his many derogatory remarks about \nMikhailovski and Vorontsov testified to lively political aims.2 But in fact Ulyanov stated narrower intentions: he wished to \nexamine the process of formation of the Russian domestic market for \ncapitalism. Petersburg and the Donbass. Russian industrialists could promote \nthe country's economic advance even without the props of govern-\nmental contracts and foreign loans.7 \nThis vista was the most inspiriting of all those painted by Russian \nMarxists. Capitalism, according to Ulyanov, still confronted an epoch \nof maturation but Russia was already a capitalist country. Russian \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustrialisation, according to Ulyanov, was at a more advanced stage \nthan was generally allowed. Russian \nMarxist theorists could appreciate that Ulyanov, in marked contrast \nwith Struve, did not praise non-socialist economists like List or \nSisrnondi. Indeed he had been acting \nas Ulyanov's literary agent: the united front of Russian Marxism in all \nits variants had still not been completely broken (although Struve did \npermit himself a brief sally, in late 1899, against the Marxist \nmovement's increasingly hagiographic deployment of Marx's texts).l1 \nAt the time the only Marxist to write a lengthy review of the book was \nP. The susceptibility of capitalism to periodic economic \ncrises was a cornerstone of Marxism, and Skvortsov expressly accused \nUlyanov of misrepresenting Das Kapital.

Stirrings towards unification occurred simultaneously else-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhere; and the Workers' Newspaper editors in Kiev summoned other \nclandestine groups to a congress in Minsk in March 1898. \nPetersburg, Moscow, Ekaterinoslav and Kiev as well as the entire \nJewish Bund. A name had to be found for it, and the \ndelegates agreed on the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The delegates committed the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party to political perspectives hammered \nout by Plekhanov and Akselrod for more than a decade.34 \nRussian Marxists, whether at liberty or (like Ulyanov) in exile, \nbelieved they were beginning to have their government on the run. But Russian workers had extracted their first instalment.35 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty aimed to tug political advantage out of an economic strife that \nappeared to follow a path of inexorable embitterment. Ulyanov had \nwritten an entire pamphlet in late 1897, and had it published in \nGeneva as The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats; and in 1899 he \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproduced a series of draft articles ending with his Project for Our \nParty's Programme. Capitalism had yet to mature \nin Russia.3s Mildly remonstrating with Plekhanov and Akselrod, he \nsought the inclusion of paragraphs describing the course of capitalist \ndevelopment in their country. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order.41 \nIn his proposals for the countryside, Ulyanov cited Akselrod's \nrecommendation that social-democrats should adopt 'the revolu-\n Capitalism in One Country \n75 \ntionary side' of Russian agrarian socialism.43 \nNonetheless there lingered a nervousness among many Russian \nMarxists about appearing too 'populistic' on the agrarian question. In \nUlyanov's opinion, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was \nan organisational mess. \nAs early as 1897, in The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats, he \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nasserted that 'the struggle with the government is impossible without a \nstrengthening and development of revolutionary organisation and \nconspirativeness' . Petersburg. \nAs Russian social-democrats in emigration, they had studied the \nBelgian labour movement and been impressed by the material and \nsocial amelioration obtained through legal methods. Both Kuskova and Prokopovich were scholars rather than \norganisers; they had no following in Russia, and Prokopovich was \narrested in 1899 when he attempted to return from emigration. In \n1898 they banded together into a European organisation proclaiming \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \nitself as the League Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad.' 58 It smuggled May Day leaflets back to Russia in \n1899, calling for the promulgation of political liberties. Workers' \nCause supported political demonstrations in Russia whenever they \noccurred. Krichevski believed that the fight for higher \nwages would gradually transmute itself into political struggle against \nthe autocracy; he also highlighted what he saw as the cultural \nimmaturity of the broad strata of the Russian working class. Yet he had a point when he said that Workers' Cause \nhad rejected the early consensus that the workers should lead Russia's \ndemocratic revolution60 \nPlekhanov campaigned simultaneously \nagainst another social-democratic newspaper.61 This to Plekhanov appeared a betrayal \n Capitalism in One Country \n79 \nof Marxism. It contained an article by the \nGerman revisionist social-democrat Eduard Bernstein arguing for an \n'evolutionary' rather than 'revolutionary' interpretation of Marxian \nideas.65 \nThis dispute was the first truly open breach in Russian Marxist unity; \nand the question was instantly posed why Plekhanov and Ulyanov \nrisked such a rupture.66 Struve in 1899 still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action. It is difficult \nto imagine either Ulyanov or Plekhanov doing as Fedoseev had done \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin writing respectful letters to Mikhailovski. Both considered Marxism to be a creative \nscience.6s They justifiably felt that their own adaptation of Marxian \npolicies to Russian circumstances showed that they were not vapid \nregurgitators of hackneyed German ideas. And Ulyanov in particu-\nlar, in the years ahead, would increasingly write and behave as if he \nalone among the exponents of Russian socialism understood Marxism \ncorrectly. For him, Kautsky and \nPlekhanov were now the world's two greatest living Marxists. He knew Kautsky to \nbe a supporter of Plekhanov's political strategy for Russia. \nBut it meant separation from Krupskaya. Petersburg. Upon release, Ulyanov \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmade hurried last contacts with potential agents for the newspaper.'81 \nThere were rows about the Jewish Bund, with Plekhanov indicating \nobjections to its inclusion in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty. The \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthree hundred miles separating Geneva from Munich were bound to \nput Ulyanov into an authoritative position. Though inexperienced in committee work, the \nnovice had picked up the necessary skills and techniques with \nconsummate ease; and Plekhanov, whose glacial manner had chilled \nall who had approached him as fellow Marxists, was having to treat his \nformer disciple as a leader of equal worthiness and power.", "Russian_Marxists_1902": " 5 \nStraightening Sticks \n'ISKRA' IS FOUNDED \nThe need to establish a political party was unquestioned among \nRussian Marxists at the turn of the century. Such an attitude had little attraction for the majority of \nRussian Marxists, at least until after 1905. It was generally recognised \nthat parties were essential for the overthrow of tsarism; even those \nearly narodniki who had been suspicious about the need for specifi-\ncally political activity had nonetheless concurred that the party was the \nmost appropriate vehicle for socialism's advance. This commitment \nwas still stronger among the Russian Marxists. The \nundemocratic system of power in Russia compelled certain responses. \nRussian Marxists would have to operate clandestinely. Ulyanov, \njoining the emigres of Russian social-democracy in 1900, was ready \nand willing to snatch whatever opportunities came his way (or could be \nmanipUlated so as to do so). Iskra had a \nprint-run of a few hundred copies; and, compared with the legal \n85 \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconservative dailies of Petersburg, it seemed a Lilliputian affair. He \nwanted to reach the organisers of existing Marxist groups. The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in 1900: \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. \nThey also knew that social disorder was increasing in Russia. Petersburg, \nTiflis, Simferopol and Kharkov. In November 1901 the workers in \nRostov-on-Don conducted a week-long series of marches and public \nmeetings. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. The new unions would be kept clear of \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. The Moscow scheme was copied elsewhere in \n1900. His immediate \nrecommendations were addressed specifically to Russia and presented \nnot as an eternal panacea but as solutions to 'the painful questions of \nour movement' . Left to themselves, workers cannot develop socialist \nideas. For the party should strive after centralisation and discipline; it \nshould operate with the techniques of clandestinity elaborated by \nRussian agrarian socialists in the 1870s. In \nproffering his prescription for the Russian party, he yet praised the \nlooser organisational arrangements possible for the German social-\ndemocrats. 'Give us an organisation of revolutionaries,' he \nexclaimed, 'and we shall turn all Russia upside down' . But in Russian political conditions it was 'an \nempty and dangerous plaything' . It was offered as a realistic assessment which \nwould advance Russian social-democrats nearer to their ultimate \ngoals. Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhad criticisms to make in 1901. Their substance is unknown; yet it was \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nserious enough for Plekhanov to feel annoyed that Akselrod would not \nhelp him to take the matter further. He instantly felt \nthat Ulyanov had supplied Russian social-democrats with something \nthat had been unavailable: an up-to-date comprehensive rationale for \nthe party's existence., for them, was a highly \nestimable account of the modes of activity appropriate to circum-\nstances in contemporary Russia.31 Krichevski's writings in 1902 initiated a \ntradition. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle.38 \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. He emphasised the prominent contribution made by the \nworkers themselves in the Russian empire to the formulation of \nsocialist ideas. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in 1901). \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them.42 \nIn 1869, Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. Marx had also spoken \nabout the virtues of communists who 'have over the great mass of the \nproletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, \nthe conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian \nmovement. Thus, too, they expected to head \nthe Russian revolutionary movement in its entirety. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the 1890s. Social-democratic activists formed the \nmost effective clandestine groups; even the catastrophe of 1899, when \nthe police rounded up five hundred undergrounders, was a sign of the \nMarxist movement's gathering strength. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Books on Russian historical development \nwere available in the shops of major cities. Their pre-eminence in the \ncamp of the forces of opposition to the monarchy seemed unchallenge-\n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nable; and it corroborated their belief that the 'vanguard' class in the \ndemocratic revolution was bound to be neither the middle class nor the \npeasantry but the factory workers. \nBy 1900 he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late 1880s and early 1890s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In 1901 the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries.51 The outstanding \ntheorist and organiser was Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov. He refused to accept the argument of \nRussian social-democrats that the peasantry and the factory workers in \nRussia could be categorised as distinct classes of the population. \nSocialist-revolutionaries treated them together as 'the toiling people'. \nUnlike the narodniki of the 1880s, Chernov recognised that capitalist \neconomic development was practicable in Russia. Chernov anticipated a lengthy epoch of \n Straightening Sticks \n95 \npropaganda before Russia would move from the 'bourgeois' to the \n'socialist' phase. They were less sceptical \nthan Chernov about the rapid acceptability of socialist ideas to the \nRussian peasantry. So that, although Chernov's populism moved even closer to \nRussian Marxism than Aleksandr Ulyanov's had done, a gap still \nremained. The \nParty of Socialist-Revolutionaries might snatch hegemony of the \nrevolutionary forces. Young intellectuals in the Volga region were \nbeginning to rally to Chernov's ideas, impressed as they were by the \nrecrudescence of peasant turbulence after the quiescence of the \n1890s. The socialist-revolutionaries could be a more potent enemy: \nthey were infidels.56 Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern. This was partly the result of the low level of literary \nproductivity of three of the six editors: Akselrod, Potresov and \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nZasulich.60 Krupskaya emigrated in 1901. He was industrious in \nkeeping tabs on the Russian underground; he and Krupskaya main-\ntained a voluminous correspondence by means of invisible inks and \nlaboriously-translated codes. Lenin' (which he had first used in 1901 in a letter to Plekhanov). Although he was to employ at least 160noms de guerre \nin his career,63 it was as Lenin that he ascended to general prestige \ninside the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party; his Iskra writings \nconsolidated a reputation already acquired as Marxist economic \ntheorist and Petersburg activist. Ulyanov-Lenin moved to establish a \ntightly cohesive party.65 The pugnacity of \nUlyanov-Lenin in Western Europe was emulated by his followers back \nin Russia. Ulyanov-Lenin was unrestrainedly militant: 'A \nfight perhaps causes irritation to a few persons, but thereby it clears the \nair; it defines relations directly and precisely; it defines which \ndisagreements are basic and which secondary, defines where there are \npeople taking a completely different road and where there are true \nparty comrades dissenting only about particularities.'66 \n Straightening Sticks \n97 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nIt worried Ulyanov-Lenin that the Iskra board had not yet drafted a \nparty programme; in 1901 he pestered Plekhanov to undertake the \njob. Plekhanov was taken to task for implying that the proletariat \nconstituted a majority ofthe Russian population.69 Ulyanov-Lenin was \na harsh examiner. Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'. Lenin was no less displeased. Lenin backed down.74 \nThe final version was close to Lenin's draft of 1899; the sections on \nfactory legislation were largely his creation, and the agrarian sections \ntoo bore his imprint. He teased Lenin over his inelegant use \nof brackets and punctuation marks, but the tensions eased between the \ntwo men in late 1902; both were willing to profess contentment with \nthe Iskra programme. It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Lenin and Plekhanov presented a \ncommon front. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. \nPlekhanov's preamble stated that 'capitalism is becoming more and \nmore the dominant mode of production' in Russia. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode. As yet, in 1902, no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in 1917, when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance. \nPlekhanov mentioned this in his first drafe9 When Lenin attacked his \noffering as being generally too 'noisy', Plekhanov substituted 'the \npolitical power' ofthe proletariat for 'dictatorship of the proletariat' .80 \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration.82 But he saw no sense in \nfurther dispute and soon accepted Lenin's view.84 Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed;85 and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin.'87 A further problem indicated a more serious implicit divi-\nsion between Lenin and Plekhanov. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. Martynov was a prominent \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's.91 Lenin's replies were caustic. Neither Martynov nor \nAkimov accepted the down-playing of the workers' capacity for \npolitical self-development, and they harrassed Plekhanov as fiercely as \nthey had Lenin over What Is To Be Done.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902. \nSocial-democratic leaders back in Russia, notably those belonging to \nSouthern Worker's editorial board and to the Bund, joined with the \nLeague Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad to convoke a meeting in \nBialystok. \nLenin had to resume the initiative quickly. A further series \nof arrests weakened Iskra's position in the winter of 1902-1903; but \nthe determination of the agents on tour in Russia bore fruit. Party \ncommittees in Nizhni Novgorod, Saratov and Rostov announced \nloyalty to the theoretical and organisational principles of Iskra.OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. But Plekhanov exonerated his colleague: 'Napoleon \nhad a passion for making his marshals divorce their wives: some gave in \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto him in the matter even though they loved their wives. Comrade \nAkimov is like Napoleon in this respect - he desires at any cost to \ndivorce me from Lenin. Lenin, already \npleased by the Bund discussion, took as prominent a role in debate as \nPlekhanov. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction.'104 Plekhanov backed Lenin. l07 Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. \nMartov disliked Lenin's proposal on the conditions of party member-\nship. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . His member would be someone 'who recognises the party \nprogramme and supports it by material means and by regular personal \nassistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations';llo \nand Martov recommended his own definition as being less \nauthoritarian and exclusive than Lenin's. But there was also a fundamental issue at stake; Lenin and \nMartov each knew what the other meant in broad terms. Martov \nwanted a slightly more 'open' party than Lenin. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. Twenty eight 'softs' took his line while \nLenin could muster only twenty two 'hards'. Lenin \nproposed a tripartite structure for the supreme party apparatus. Plekhanov and Lenin would lord it over Iskra. Lenin raced \nout to tug back Shot man with the admonition that 'only fools use their \nfists in polemics' . Lenin's supporter S. Gusev circulated a forged list purporting to \ncontain Martov's nominees for the central party apparatus; it included, \nas a ploy to discredit Martov, several advocates of the 'Economistic' \nideas already condemned by the entire Iskra faction.us Lenin strove to \nweld the 'hards' together. There were \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany issues which saw both groupings inside Iskra united. In particular \nit was their common wish that the party should be centralised, \ndisciplined and clandestine; the 'softs' felt no less strongly than the \n'hards' that Russian political conditions disallowed the formation of an \nopen mass party on the model of German social-democrats.

In the winter of 1888-89 he reportedly began \nto study Karl Marx's Das Kapital. Ulyanov's collected \nwritings will be combed in vain for traces of adverse comment on Karl \nMarx. Sklyarenko was \nonly a little older than Ulyanov; he had once been influenced by the \nideas of People's Freedom but he too was entering a period of \nreconsideration which would lead him to Marxism. 26 \nMARX AND ENGELS \nMarx's ideas and Russian populism, while coinciding in several \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nimportant areas, diverged in others of equal significance. The young \nVladimir's debt to Marx is hard to define with precision. Marx died in 1883. \nCitations made by him in his articles of 1893-95 suggest that, if Kapital \nwas the most closely scrutinised text, The Communist Manifesto \n(written by Marx together with Frederick Engels) and Engels's \nAnti-Duhring were also works of influence. From the end of the 1880s until \nhis death in 1924, Ulyanov was an assiduous Marxologist; he was \nengaged more intensively in the study of Marx and Engels than of any \nother theorist (including the populists). \nThe economics of Karl Marx were an enduring interest of Ulyanov's. Marx had \ndescribed in Das Kapital how industrialists, introducing new forms of \nmachinery and a new division of labour into their factories, had \ninaugurated transformations of epochal significance. And perhaps Kapital, with its withering critique of proposals \nto preserve 'communalistic' social relationships once capitalist \ndevelopment had begun, leant further strength to his Russian fol-\nlower's standpoine2 \nUlyanov did not eulogise capitalism. His aim was to indicate that the \nmodernisation of the Russian economy would afford advantages \nexploitable by socialists in the future. Marx, in addition, sketched a \nmajestic sequence of stages in historical change. And capitalism would be supplanted, ultimately, by \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncommunism.40 \nIn general, Ulyanov argued that Marxism offered a satisfactory basis \nfor the explanation of social relations. Marx \nand Engels had laid the foundations. Marxism had to be handled 'creatively'. \nThere were many Marxists who objected to his interpretations.45 The complexity and inchoateness \nof Marx's Marxism were recognised even in the years shortly after his \ndeath; and these qualities are even more obvious now that we possess \nseveral important tracts which lay unpublished until the 1920s and \n1930s.46 \nIt has been pointed out that Marx allowed for a variety of routes of \nsocial development in the epochs prior to socialism; and that he used \nthe concept of 'Asiatic despotism' rather than 'feudalism' to designate \na number of societies in the East.48 Doubts about Lenin's version of Marxism \nexist in further areas.49 Ulyanov, furthermore, played down the working \nclass's ability to develop its own socialist ideas. Marx was not so \npessimistic.51 Ulyanov's Marxism was, \naccordingly, a legitimate version in most respects. \nRUSSIAN MARXISM AND RUSSIAN POPULISM \nThis meant that debate among Russian Marxists could not be confined \nto the generalities of Marxism. Russia's particularities required consideration. Marx \nhimself caused problems. In 1877 he \nwrote to the populist Mikhailovski denying that Das Kapital pre-\nscribed a model of historical development for all countries.52 In 1881 \nthe Russian Marxist Vera Zasulich approached him for clarification. He repeated that the Russian \npeasant commune might well be usable as a vehicle for making a direct \ntransition to socialism. In his \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nlater years, Marx himself collected notes on Russian village tradi-\ntions. Engels after \nMarx's death continued to sanction terrorist activity.55 He was not \ninitially attracted, moreover, by the Russian Marxists emerging in \nthe 1880s; he treated them as somewhat bookish specimens who \nlacked the revolutionary instincts of the courageous narodnik \nundergrounders. He affirmed that once \nthe Russian economy had embarked upon the capitalist road of \ndevelopment there would be no means of preventing capitalism from \ntaking a hold; and he felt in any case that a commune-based revolution \nin Russia would fail without aid from revolutions in industrially-\nadvanced countries elsewhere. It was he who, in 1872, had made the \nfirst translation of Marx's Kapital into any foreign language; and his \nensuing correspondence with Marx and Engels is replete with attempts \nto persuade them that the narodnik belief in the impracticability of \ncapitalist development in Russia by no means contradicted Marxian \neconomics. In addition Petr Tkachev, theorist of narodnik terrorism, \nwas also one of Europe's most distinguished Marxologists in the 1870s. Engels and Tkachev engaged in \npublic dispute in 1874. It was an intriguing spectacle, not least because \nit provided the first sight of Marxism's co-founder being castigated as \nhaving drawn incorrect conclusions from his own works.59 \nBut even this did not irretrievably damage the reputation of Marx \n Roads to Freedom \n39 \nand Engels among populists; Mikhailovski's anti-Marxist tirades were \nnot universally approved. In writing a new \ndraft programme for People's Freedom in 1887, he expressly \ndescribed the Marxists in Russia as comrades.60 His ideas too had a \nMarxist aspect. Aleksandr \nUlyanov bestrode two periods in revolutionary endeavour, and he \nappealed for revolutionary unity on the grounds that the dis-\nagreements between Marxists and his own group of narodniki covered \nquestions that were not 'essential' ones.6l \nSuch appeals, however, fell upon increasingly deaf ears among \nMarxists after the late 1880s.62 \nThese were attitudes justifiably taken by Russian Marxists to be \nquintessentially opposed to the thrust of Das Kapital and The \nCommunist Manifesto (which had claimed a much greater portion of \nMarx's time and mental effort than his letter to Mikhailovski). \nNevertheless other populist ideas lived on in Russian Marxism. \nMikhailovski accused the Russian Marxists of callous disregard for the \nsufferings ofthe peasantry in the 1891 famine; they were charged with \ncondoning any phenomenon, however oppressive to the mass of the \npopulation, so long as it helped capitalist development. The Marxist N. Maslovin the 1890s.64 Some Marxists went \nfurther than Maslov. In fact, by the \nturn of the century, there even appeared Russian Marxists (among \nwhom the most notable was L. \nGEORGI PLEKHANOV'S MARXISM \nHe was not without assistance from other Marxists in elaborating his \nMarxism; and the Russian who most influenced him was Georgi \nValentinovich Plekhanov. He gradually accepted Marxist political posi-\ntions. Russian Marxism received its baptism of \nfire in a struggle with agrarian socialism. This made the early Russian \nMarxists keen to demonstrate the validity of their self-description as \nMarxists; and their edginess was exacerbated by the statements made \nin the 1880s by Marx and Engels. Perhaps it was only in 1892, when \nEngels at last declared that capitalism had decisively gripped the \nRussian economy,67 that the coolness towards the experiments in \nRussian Marxism fully vanished. Plekhanov in any case addressed \nhimself mainly to a Russian readership. Premature attempts by socialists to seize power in Russia \n Roads to Freedom \n41 \nhad to be averted.69 \nPlekhanov's Socialism And Political Struggle, written in 1883, put \nthis case at length; he expanded his reasonings in 1885 with Our \nDisagreements. Both books were acclaimed in most respects by all \nyoung Russian Marxists. \nHe also sided with Plekhanov over those matters in his books that \nsparked off Russian Marxism's earliest internal dispute. It had \narrived in Russia. Das Kapital contained little about the peasantry; but \nPlekhanov endeavoured to show that Marxian categories of analysis \nwere applicable to the changing economic relationships in the depths \nof rural Russia. His \ntwo early books were a crucial contribution to the Russian Marxist \ndoctrine that capitalism was on the verge of pervading all economic \nrelations in town and countryside. Other ex-narodniki \njoined him in 1883 to propose the adoption of a Marxist programme \nfor Russian socialists.73 European history contained many examples of slow, steady \nprocesses of change interrupted by unexpected explosions of discon-\n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntent. The Emancipation Of \nLabour Group wished to be in a position to take full advantage of any \nsimilar situation which might arise in Russia. Plekhanov drew atten-\ntion to The Communist Manifesto; he pointed out that Germany, at the \ntime of its publication in 1848, had been at a level of economic and \npolitical development comparable with Russia's in the 1880s. Even Russian economic backwardness was to be \nregarded as an asset: it would mean that socialist ideas could be \ndisseminated among Russia's working class at an earlier stage in the \ncountry's economic transformation than had been possible in Britain, \nFrance or Germany.74 \nSuch ideas were endorsed by Ulyanov and the young generation of \nMarxists. This was that industrial \nworkers were the 'vanguard' of the social forces opposed to the \nRussian monarchy. All the other \nclasses and groups were likely to make compromises with tsarism. \nPlekhanov's colleague Akselrod therefore urged that industrial work-\ners should maintain 'hegemony' over the anti-monarchical movement \nin Russia. \nPlekhanov called upon the socialist elements of the intelligentsia to \nguide the workers towards Marxism; and, again, Ulyanov was to warm \nto Plekhanov's belief in the intellectual's capacity to attain exact \n Roads to Freedom \n43 \nknowledge of society - a belief that was not universally accepted by \nMarxists inside and outside Russia. The Russian Marxist programme should call for a system \nof parliamentary elections based upon universal, secret-ballot suf-\nfrage.78 His Group felt that such a programme \nwould provide the political and economic framework necessary for the \nmaturation of Russian capitalism. \nPlekhanov claimed to have sketched a programme in line with the \ncontours of European Marxism as it was widely interpreted in the years \nafter Marx's death.79 Such a viewpoint was not \nin keeping with the outlook of Karl Kautsky and other theorists of the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party in the 1890s (even though Marx \nhimself had approved of an assassination campaign in Russia). It is equally \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvisible in his treatment of the subsequent measures for the eventual \ndismemberment of capitalism itself. The version of Marxism produced by Plekhanov \nseemed to his young follower to be both entirely acceptable in doctrine \nand wonderfully suited to the political tasks facing Russian Marxists in \nthe years ahead.84 \nACTIVISM IN SAMARA \nIt took time for the Marxist circles in the Russian empire to acquire \ntheir organisational identity. In 1886 he made contact with \nMarxist activists in St. Petersburg led by the Bulgarian D.8s Nevertheless his \nown intellectual odyssey towards Marxism was being repeated by \nmany revolutionaries.8s But revolutionaries of Russian origin also \nwere bestirring themselves in the same direction: towards Marxism. They offered \nthe chance to win further recruits to Marxism. Nobody has pinpointed \nwhen Sklyarenko's organisation made its own crossing over to Russian \nMarxist doctrines. \nCould it be that in 1890 and 1891 he detected the inadequacies in \nagrarian-socialist views without yet embracing a Russian Marxist \nperspective. Ulyanov was having his \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfirst working contact with non-privileged sections of the rural popula-\ntion; and we may wonder whether the experience simply confirmed his \nconvictions about them or altered them in some way. They maintained an interest in works by non-Marxist \nwriters. And, as confidence \nincreased, the Samara activists sought to do something of their own to \nstrengthen the plausibility of Russian Marxism in general. lo2 But there is no denying that \nUlyanov had by now emerged as a competent exponent of Marxism.", "Russian_Marxism_1902": " 5 \nStraightening Sticks \n'ISKRA' IS FOUNDED \nThe need to establish a political party was unquestioned among \nRussian Marxists at the turn of the century. Such an attitude had little attraction for the majority of \nRussian Marxists, at least until after 1905. It was generally recognised \nthat parties were essential for the overthrow of tsarism; even those \nearly narodniki who had been suspicious about the need for specifi-\ncally political activity had nonetheless concurred that the party was the \nmost appropriate vehicle for socialism's advance. This commitment \nwas still stronger among the Russian Marxists. The \nundemocratic system of power in Russia compelled certain responses. \nRussian Marxists would have to operate clandestinely. Ulyanov, \njoining the emigres of Russian social-democracy in 1900, was ready \nand willing to snatch whatever opportunities came his way (or could be \nmanipUlated so as to do so). Iskra had a \nprint-run of a few hundred copies; and, compared with the legal \n85 \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconservative dailies of Petersburg, it seemed a Lilliputian affair. He \nwanted to reach the organisers of existing Marxist groups. The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in 1900: \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. \nThey also knew that social disorder was increasing in Russia. Petersburg, \nTiflis, Simferopol and Kharkov. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. The new unions would be kept clear of \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. The Moscow scheme was copied elsewhere in \n1900. For the party should strive after centralisation and discipline; it \nshould operate with the techniques of clandestinity elaborated by \nRussian agrarian socialists in the 1870s. In \nproffering his prescription for the Russian party, he yet praised the \nlooser organisational arrangements possible for the German social-\ndemocrats. 'Give us an organisation of revolutionaries,' he \nexclaimed, 'and we shall turn all Russia upside down' . But in Russian political conditions it was 'an \nempty and dangerous plaything' . It was offered as a realistic assessment which \nwould advance Russian social-democrats nearer to their ultimate \ngoals. Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhad criticisms to make in 1901. Their substance is unknown; yet it was \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nserious enough for Plekhanov to feel annoyed that Akselrod would not \nhelp him to take the matter further. \nPossibly he wanted to avoid the fragmentation of the newspaper \nboard; and he may also have been loathe to castigate a work which at \nany rate attacked revisionism in Marxism. He instantly felt \nthat Ulyanov had supplied Russian social-democrats with something \nthat had been unavailable: an up-to-date comprehensive rationale for \nthe party's existence., for them, was a highly \nestimable account of the modes of activity appropriate to circum-\nstances in contemporary Russia.31 Krichevski's writings in 1902 initiated a \ntradition. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle.38 \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. He emphasised the prominent contribution made by the \nworkers themselves in the Russian empire to the formulation of \nsocialist ideas. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in 1901). \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them.42 \nIn 1869, Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. Thus, too, they expected to head \nthe Russian revolutionary movement in its entirety. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the 1890s. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Books on Russian historical development \nwere available in the shops of major cities. \nBy 1900 he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late 1880s and early 1890s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In 1901 the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries.51 The outstanding \ntheorist and organiser was Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov. He refused to accept the argument of \nRussian social-democrats that the peasantry and the factory workers in \nRussia could be categorised as distinct classes of the population. \nUnlike the narodniki of the 1880s, Chernov recognised that capitalist \neconomic development was practicable in Russia. Chernov anticipated a lengthy epoch of \n Straightening Sticks \n95 \npropaganda before Russia would move from the 'bourgeois' to the \n'socialist' phase. They were less sceptical \nthan Chernov about the rapid acceptability of socialist ideas to the \nRussian peasantry. So that, although Chernov's populism moved even closer to \nRussian Marxism than Aleksandr Ulyanov's had done, a gap still \nremained.56 Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern.60 Krupskaya emigrated in 1901. He was industrious in \nkeeping tabs on the Russian underground; he and Krupskaya main-\ntained a voluminous correspondence by means of invisible inks and \nlaboriously-translated codes. Lenin' (which he had first used in 1901 in a letter to Plekhanov). Although he was to employ at least 160noms de guerre \nin his career,63 it was as Lenin that he ascended to general prestige \ninside the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party; his Iskra writings \nconsolidated a reputation already acquired as Marxist economic \ntheorist and Petersburg activist. Ulyanov-Lenin moved to establish a \ntightly cohesive party.65 The pugnacity of \nUlyanov-Lenin in Western Europe was emulated by his followers back \nin Russia.'66 \n Straightening Sticks \n97 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nIt worried Ulyanov-Lenin that the Iskra board had not yet drafted a \nparty programme; in 1901 he pestered Plekhanov to undertake the \njob.69 Ulyanov-Lenin was \na harsh examiner. Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'. Lenin was no less displeased. Lenin backed down. He teased Lenin over his inelegant use \nof brackets and punctuation marks, but the tensions eased between the \ntwo men in late 1902; both were willing to profess contentment with \nthe Iskra programme. It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Lenin and Plekhanov presented a \ncommon front. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. \nPlekhanov's preamble stated that 'capitalism is becoming more and \nmore the dominant mode of production' in Russia. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode. As yet, in 1902, no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in 1917, when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance. \nPlekhanov mentioned this in his first drafe9 When Lenin attacked his \noffering as being generally too 'noisy', Plekhanov substituted 'the \npolitical power' ofthe proletariat for 'dictatorship of the proletariat' .80 \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration.84 Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed;85 and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin.'87 A further problem indicated a more serious implicit divi-\nsion between Lenin and Plekhanov. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. Martynov was a prominent \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's.91 Lenin's replies were caustic. He re-affirmed, \nbluntly and without further argumentation, that the implementation of \nhis own ideas would deliver a deathblow to feudalism in Russian \nagriculture.95 Not so Akimov: he was disturbed by other breaks with \nthe conventional European understanding of Marxism which were \nmade by Iskra; he especially objected to the demand for a proletarian \ndictatorship.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902. \nSocial-democratic leaders back in Russia, notably those belonging to \nSouthern Worker's editorial board and to the Bund, joined with the \nLeague Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad to convoke a meeting in \nBialystok. \nLenin had to resume the initiative quickly. Party \ncommittees in Nizhni Novgorod, Saratov and Rostov announced \nloyalty to the theoretical and organisational principles of Iskra.OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. Comrade \nAkimov is like Napoleon in this respect - he desires at any cost to \ndivorce me from Lenin. Lenin, already \npleased by the Bund discussion, took as prominent a role in debate as \nPlekhanov. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction.'104 Plekhanov backed Lenin. l07 Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. \nMartov disliked Lenin's proposal on the conditions of party member-\nship. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . But there was also a fundamental issue at stake; Lenin and \nMartov each knew what the other meant in broad terms. Martov \nwanted a slightly more 'open' party than Lenin. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. Lenin \nproposed a tripartite structure for the supreme party apparatus. Plekhanov and Lenin would lord it over Iskra.

The characteristic agrarian-socialist affection \nfor the small, self-contained community found little echo in Ulyanov's \n Roads to Freedom \n35 \nwritings. Feudalism gave way \nto capitalism.46 \nIt has been pointed out that Marx allowed for a variety of routes of \nsocial development in the epochs prior to socialism; and that he used \nthe concept of 'Asiatic despotism' rather than 'feudalism' to designate \na number of societies in the East. He conceded that the peasantry was not a \nuniform social class and that a petite bourgeoisie was already being \nformed in the countryside; he stated also that urban workers would \nhave to be the main conveyors of the idea of revolution to the people.

He did not support calls for \nthe lowering of agricultural prices; he did not, at least in the 1890s and \nindeed until 1905, favour the proposal to transfer all agricultural land \nto the peasantry. Russian Marxism received its baptism of \nfire in a struggle with agrarian socialism.68 According to Plekhanov, the next stage in the \ncountry's political transformation would be not an agrarian-socialist \ngovernment but a government representing the interests of the rising \nbourgeoisie.69 \nPlekhanov's Socialism And Political Struggle, written in 1883, put \nthis case at length; he expanded his reasonings in 1885 with Our \nDisagreements.

A hundred students \nwere arrested, Ulyanov being among them.'13 Ulyanov \nbehaved recklessly. The Ministry of \nInternal Affairs meted out a sentence typical for first offences of this \nkind: Ulyanov was exiled to Kokushkino, the estate recently inherited \nby his mother upon the death of Dr Blank. As \nUlyanov was to confide to a friend, Chernyshevski 'ploughed him over \nand over' . Such was Ulyanov's admiration that he \ntook the dangerous step of writing to Chernyshevski (but he received \nno reply since the exiled oppositionist was already mortally iII).17 \nThe Ulyanov family was allowed to move back to Kazan in \nSeptember 1888. Bogoraz had fled to Rostov; but \nUlyanov managed to track down M. But quite possibly their ideas were similar to those of \nAleksandr Ulyanov. Ulyanov brought his legal textbooks and his political reading \nmaterial to Alakaevka. Ulyanov's collected \nwritings will be combed in vain for traces of adverse comment on Karl \nMarx. Sklyarenko was \nonly a little older than Ulyanov; he had once been influenced by the \nideas of People's Freedom but he too was entering a period of \nreconsideration which would lead him to Marxism. Ulyanov found \nhimself among congenial colleagues in his own period of intellectual \nferment. Such impression as he \nmade upon Ulyanov was achieved through his books. The winter of 1888-89 is probably the correct date of \nUlyanov's first reading of Kapital, but we cannot be categorical: a few \naccounts suggest that it was in fact earlier. 27 Ulyanov was a bibliophile. Ulyanov's earliest extant writings offer some clues.28 It is quite likely that \nthese same books were familiar and important to Ulyanov in 1889. Ulyanov the \nanti-autobiographer has left no account. From the end of the 1880s until \nhis death in 1924, Ulyanov was an assiduous Marxologist; he was \nengaged more intensively in the study of Marx and Engels than of any \nother theorist (including the populists). \nWe must therefore tread tentatively in our assessment of Marx's \nimpact upon Ulyanov while he was yet a young man. \nThe economics of Karl Marx were an enduring interest of Ulyanov's.3o \nUnlike the narodniki, Ulyanov condoned capitalist development.31 Ulyanov also approved of \nlarge-scale social units. Nor had \nUlyanov.40 \nIn general, Ulyanov argued that Marxism offered a satisfactory basis \nfor the explanation of social relations. Ulyanov propounded this view avidly. Ulyanov spoke of Kapital as incontest-\nable truth.49 Ulyanov, furthermore, played down the working \nclass's ability to develop its own socialist ideas.50 In addition Ulyanov had a penchant for political \nviolence.51 Ulyanov's Marxism was, \naccordingly, a legitimate version in most respects. A case of continuing sympathy is found in \nVladimir Ulyanov's narodnik brother Aleksandr. Aleksandr \nUlyanov bestrode two periods in revolutionary endeavour, and he \nappealed for revolutionary unity on the grounds that the dis-\nagreements between Marxists and his own group of narodniki covered \nquestions that were not 'essential' ones. Aleksandr Ulyanov was still too \npopulistic for them. In \nsome aspects, their influence was stronger upon others than upon \nVladimir Ulyanov himself.66 \nUlyanov shrugged off such suggestions. Ulyanov reiterated its arguments. He argued that the economic trends were \nirreversible;70 and Ulyanov ranged himself with him against the \nFedoseevs and Maslovs who took a less indifferent attitude to the \npeasantry's plight.71 In addition, Ulyanov approved of Plekhanov's \ninsistence that capitalism was no longer a distant projection. He was an aggressive, sarcastic debater (and this \nmust have been an element in his attractiveness to Ulyanov, who was \nto become notorious for his polemical zeal).74 \nSuch ideas were endorsed by Ulyanov and the young generation of \nMarxists.83 Ulyanov was on \nPlekhanov's side. \nAmong them, in Samara, were Vladimir Ulyanov and A. \nSklyarenko. Vladimir Ulyanov was reportedly even more \n Roads to Freedom \n45 \nenthusiastic about the new ideas than Sklyarenko and to have been the \nforce behind the group's transformation. Accounts of the meeting in Samara suggest that \nUlyanov revealed himself as a devastating critic of Sabunaev's \nstrategy. Rossinevich repeated Sabunaev's attempt in \nMarch 1891, it was again Ulyanov who took up the intellectual \ncudgels. No activist with even the barest sense of \nself-preservation would jot down such details at the time; but later in \nlife Ulyanov was to date his revolutionary career as having started in \n1892-93.91 Yet Ulyanov, as M.'92 These were formative years in Ulyanov's \ncareer. \nNonetheless Ulyanov's life was not yet wholly absorbed in political \nactivism. Ulyanov was having his \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfirst working contact with non-privileged sections of the rural popula-\ntion; and we may wonder whether the experience simply confirmed his \nconvictions about them or altered them in some way. \nUlyanov made no other attempt at the practical application of his \neconomics until becoming leader of the Soviet government; hencefor-\nward his knowledge of the world of toil was to come through books and \nfrom activists with first-hand acquaintance with economic affairs in the \nvillage and town. Yet another tragedy \nafflicted the Ulyanov family. \nHers was the third funeral that it fell to twenty-one years old Vladimir \nUlyanov to organise.'97 \nThroughout 1892 the Sklyarenko-Ulyanov group continued their \n Roads to Freedom \n47 \nmeetings. It is likely that Ulyanov was familiar with the writings of \nRicardo, Guizot and Ashley. Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit \nsometimes arrived in Samara, and Ulyanov would pounce on copies \neagerly.99 Ulyanov's own work as a lawyer, which not \ninfrequently involved the defence of individual peasants, gave him \nfurther insights into the operation of the village commune. \nThere is a story too that Ulyanov and Mikhailovski met face to face in \ndebate in the summer of that year, and that Mikhailovski came off \nworsted. lo2 But there is no denying that \nUlyanov had by now emerged as a competent exponent of Marxism.", "Ulyanov_1895": " \nUlyanov decided to pull up his Volga roots and move there. Skvortsov and S. Ulyanov also \nmade a stop-over in the town of Vladimir in order to meet N.2 Ulyanov's initiative did not secure him an automatic welcome \nin st. Radchenko. \nUlyanov nonetheless took some months to make his influence felt \nupon the Petersburg Marxists. Yet it was not until autumn 1894, fully a year after the move \nfrom Samara, that Ulyanov became exercised by pedagogical activity.4 \nNor did Ulyanov participate in the group's negotiations with other \nworkers' organisations in the winter 1893-94. \nUlyanov's initial pre-occupation, in fact, was with his books. A \nsecond point of interest is discoverable in another article written by \nUlyanov in 1893, Concerning the So-Called Question of Markets.8 Ulyanov's contribution \nwas already a significant extension of Plekhanov's original claims.11 \nUlyanov too involved himself, offering himself as tutor to a workers' \ncircle in autumn 1894. Petersburg in September 1894 \nby Yuli Osipovich Martov (who was shortly to become a close \ncollaborator of Ulyanov's); and he brought news of the success of the \ntactics in western regions of the empire. And when strikes occurred in \na number of armaments works in January 1895 it was Ulyanov who \ncomposed the proclamatory leaflets.ls This develop-\nment, Ulyanov declared, had now commenced. Through their common friend Aleksandr Potresov, \nUlyanov met up with Struve around New Year 1895. Ulyanov wanted \nhelp with publication of his economic studies.17 \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nULYANOV, STRUVE AND PLEKHANOV \nVladimir Ulyanov's relations with Petr Struve were an alliance of \nconvenience. It catches the eye that Ulyanov, who in the 1900s was \noften portrayed as the incarnation of implacable irreconcilability, did \nnot appear in this light to his early comrades in St. Tugan-Baranovski, S. Ulyanov \ndisagreed about details in their depiction of the pattern of capitalism's \ngrowth;20 but he evidently derived intellectual benefit and perhaps also \n Arrivals \n53 \na degree of psychological support from his discussions with Struve, \nTugan and Bulgakov. \nThe conditionality of Ulyanov's alliance, however, was manifest \nfrom the start. Ulyanov was the most \nnotable aggressor. Ulyanov anticipated a faster and more violent \ntransition to socialism. Ulyanov highlighted the 'bourgeois direction' of his country's \neconomy.29 \nStruve found Ulyanov's description of Russian reality hopelessly \nhyperbolical.32 Already, \ntoo, Plekhanov objected to Ulyanov's depiction of Russian feudalism. \nTHE EMERGING LEADER \nVladimir Ulyanov at the age of twenty five was recognised by his \ncomrades as 'a person of great calibre' . Revolution was \nUlyanov's career and his dream.41 \nIt was in the capital that Ulyanov met Nadezhda Konstantinovna \nKrupskaya. She was a Marxist activist belonging to the political milieu \njoined by Ulyanov, and was present at those early sessions where he \nattracted respect as an economist. It was aural: Ulyanov's sarcastic laughter. \nUlyanov himself was physically agreeable in the eyes of very many \nwomen. But \nUlyanov was obviously the dominant partner.46 Ulyanov was contented.48 Plekhanov, despite their differences over \nmany issues, was Ulyanov's idol; nobody alive, except Frederick \nEngels (who died that August), evoked commensurate respect from \nhim. Awe mingled with affection; \nUlyanov would later recollect that he had had the feeling of 'being in \nlove' with Plekhanov. It is therefore all the more suggestive of \nthe profound importance attached by Ulyanov to the world of ideas. In instincts, mannerisms and \ntechnique it is remarkable how closely Ulyanov the rising theorist and \nactivist resembles Lenin the experienced premier of the Soviet \ngovernment. On 2 May 1895 Ulyanov arrived in Lausanne and \nobtained Plekhanov's address. Both his elders \nwere favourably impressed by Ulyanov. Plekhanov, Akselrod and Ulyanov found it easy to \ncome to terms with each other. Plekhanov and \n Arrivals \n59 \nAkselrod would act as newspaper editors in Western Europe while \nUlyanov headed a co-editorial committee in St.52 \nUlyanov spent the remainder of that summer in excursions around \ncontinental Europe.53 Ulyanov \ncontinued with his tour: in June 1895 he moved to Paris and visited \nMarx's son-in-law Paul Lafargue; in July and August he transferred to \nBerlin, working daily in the Prussian State Library. Ulyanov, Y. Martov and G. Krzhizhanovski. \nUlyanov compiled his information directly from the workers them-\nselves. Yet Ulyanov had not fogotten his agreement \n 60 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith Plekhanov and Akselrod. The Petersburg organisation still \nwanted to assist the foundation of an emigre newspaper, and Ulyanov \nwrote and sent material to Akselrod in November. Ulyanov was to be editor. Ulyanov was \namong those caught.61 Anyone joining a revolutionary group had to \naccept risks; Ulyanov was philosophical. \nPetersburg strikers, Ulyanov concentrated upon expanding his eco-\nnomic writings into a full-length book with a view towards demolishing \nagrarian-socialist theories once and for all. It was \nUlyanov's acute expectation of the autocracy's imminent demise that \nled him, in the winter of 1895-96, to review the party programme \nprojected by Plekhanov a decade previously. Ulyanov found nothing \nin it to reject. This had Ulyanov's assent.68 \nUlyanov entered this discussion. Ulyanov was sentenced to three years' exile \nin eastern Siberia. Apart from seeing his family, Ulyanov again contacted the \nUnion Of Struggle. The first but not the second \nrequest was satisfied in Ulyanov's case. Such arrivals were few in \nUlyanov's first twelve months of residence in Siberia (although it was \nin this fashion that he received the compliment from Plekhanov and \nAkselrod that 'he wrote better than anyone else in Russia for the \nworkers').", "Ulyanov_1899": " \nBogdanov, V. Chernov, P. Ulyanov were \nalready set fair to emulate them. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia. Ulyanov's erudite footnotes referred to over six \nhundred books and articles.2 But in fact Ulyanov stated narrower intentions: he wished to \nexamine the process of formation of the Russian domestic market for \ncapitalism.3 The particularity of Ulyanov-IIin's theme is discernible in \nthe gaps, which he freely acknowledged, in his treatment. Ulyanov found this too tentative. Russian \nMarxist theorists could appreciate that Ulyanov, in marked contrast \nwith Struve, did not praise non-socialist economists like List or \nSisrnondi. Indeed he had been acting \nas Ulyanov's literary agent: the united front of Russian Marxism in all \nits variants had still not been completely broken (although Struve did \npermit himself a brief sally, in late 1899, against the Marxist \nmovement's increasingly hagiographic deployment of Marx's texts).13 Ulyanov composed a suitably \naggressive retort.15 \nSkvortsov's main theoretical criticism had been that Ulyanov left no \nroom for the occurrence of economic crises. 16 This remark especially \nriled Ulyanov. The susceptibility of capitalism to periodic economic \ncrises was a cornerstone of Marxism, and Skvortsov expressly accused \nUlyanov of misrepresenting Das Kapital. But Ulyanov, when taken to task by \nSkvortsov, convincingly disclaimed any intention of proving the \npracticability of proportional co-operation between branches of the \n Capitalism in One Country \n69 \neconomy.19 And in 1898 Ulyanov published articles not only in riposte \nto Skvortsov but also against Tugan. The growth of capitalism, Ulyanov emphasised, \ninevitably caused unrest among the ever more numerous body of the \nworking class. Chayanov. \nUlyanov's vision of an ineluctable process of industrialisation appears \nsanguine in the light of the difficulties experienced today by Third \nWorld countries seeking economic modernisation.26 \nTHE PARTY IN RUSSIA \nThe intrinsic qualities of Ulyanov's scholarship give the lie to \nsuppositions that his book's economic optimism originated exclusively \nfrom a populistic zeal, albeit transmuted into a Marxist form, to \n Capitalism in One Country \n71 \nforeshorten the schedule for revolutionary change (even though the \nforeshortening instinct was undoubtedly a deep-seated part of his \nmake-up ). Fortunately for \nUlyanov, 1899 was also the year when Karl Kautsky published The \nAgrarian Question; and Ulyanov delightedly noted that he had \nanalysed industrialisation in a manner not dissimilar from his own. In January 1898 Ulyanov wrote to the authorities requesting \nthat his 'fiancee' be permitted to join him in Shushenskoe. At any rate, the authorities took \nUlyanov at his word but insisted upon marriage. \nUlyanov and Krupskaya had been among those St.32 Ulyanov was to \nbecome notorious for his heavy-handed manipulation of Congress \narrangement,. \nEven if Ulyanov had evaded capture in 1895 and survived to make his \ninfluence felt in Minsk, he would almost certainly have still joined his \ncomrades in prison and exile. \nPROJECTS FOR THE PARTY \nNews of the Congress in fact reached Ulyanov in May 1898. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order. Ulyanov then added a list of social reforms. Ulyanov opposed the \ndismemberment of capitalist latifundia. Ulyanov's intentions were two-sided. In \nUlyanov's opinion, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was \nan organisational mess. Ulyanov did not go \ncompletely overboard into organisational authoritarianism. And Vladimir Ulyanov \njustifiably represented his programmatic and organisational proposals \nas a valid development of the doctrines of Plekhanov. But Ulyanov stood by Plekhanov. Ulyanov clarified his \nposition.54 Ulyanov had not altered his mind in Siberia. Prokopovich.62 \nUlyanov, hearing of the controversy in August 1899, took \nPlekhanov's part. Ulyanov was as \ninfuriated as Plekhanov. If anything, Plekhanov at this moment was \neven less tolerant than Ulyanov. Ulyanov resisted a severing of organisational \nlinks. It is difficult \nto imagine either Ulyanov or Plekhanov doing as Fedoseev had done \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin writing respectful letters to Mikhailovski. And Ulyanov in particu-\nlar, in the years ahead, would increasingly write and behave as if he \nalone among the exponents of Russian socialism understood Marxism \ncorrectly.69 \nRELEASE FROM EXILE \nUntil the First World War, however, Ulyanov's focus was upon \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party; he commented about \ndisputes racking the German Social-Democratic Party, but resisted the \ntemptation to intervene vigorously. Ulyanov experienced inhibitions. \nUlyanov's deference had its instrumental side. He knew \ntoo that Kautsky, as a man of the pen, would be pleased by Ulyanov's \nproposed remedy for the Russian party's nagging ills. Ulyanov wanted \nto establish a central party newspaper. As they \n Capitalism in One Country \n81 \nwere the first to admit, they had entered the ambit of Ulyanov's \nmagnetism of personality; he seemed to them to be a born leader. The order for Ulyanov's release from exile forbade residence \nin metropolitan, industrial or university towns of the empire.77 Ulyanov \nand Potresov had made a start on getting the necessary monies. Ulyanov, however, insisted.78 \nBy late spring 1900 Ulyanov and Potresov were convinced that \npolice surveillance would make it difficult to set up the presses in \nRussia; and their fear increased when, on 21 May, Ulyanov was \narrested while making a trip to St. Upon release, Ulyanov \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmade hurried last contacts with potential agents for the newspaper. \nAkselrod's house was near Zurich and Ulyanov spent a while there \nbefore moving on. The only unpleasantness, which was to appear \nimportant to Ulyanov solely in the light of ensuing events, occurred in \nconnection with Plekhanov. Ulyanov was being braced to accept a dictatorial reluctance to \nlet slip a chance to dominate a major social-democratic publication.80 \nPlekhanov and Ulyanov came face to face in late July. Plekhanov was touchy about Kautsky (who, Ulyanov surmised, \nhad not opened the pages of Die Neue Zeit to him as often as he felt he \ndeserved). Ulyanov conceded to \nPlekhanov the right to edit the terms of Struve's involvement with \nIskra; but the days passed by in Geneva, and still Ulyanov had not \nreceived Plekhanov's version. Ulyanov tried to do the final editing for \nhimself.82 Outraged, Ulyanov retired to Steindl's Wiener \nGrand-Cafe and tried to get his anger off his chest by committing his \naccount to paper. Ulyanov wanted to \nbase the newspaper in Munich with himself and Potresov as chief \neditors. And, when faced down by the \ntwo young 'careerists' (as Ulyanov felt sure he now thought of them), \nhe submitted his resignation from the project.84 Ulyanov and Potresov \nfell for the ploy and begged him to reconsider. Ulyanov and Potresov instantly gave in. Ulyanov \nand Potresov were unperturbed this time.86 Subtle \nmanoeuvrer that he was, Ulyanov had made the vital discovery that the \nway to defeat Plekhanov over Iskra was to avoid open pitched battles \nand to conduct a war of attrition. A triumphant Ulyanov packed \nhis bags and departed for Munich on 24 August 1900. The older emigres would be represented by Plekhanov, \nAkselrod and Zasulich; and the newcomers by Ulyanov, Potresov and \nMartov.

Subsequent generations \nwould often regard The Development of Capitalism as a comprehen-\nsive textbook on the country's economic transformation in modern \ntimes. It was a nostrum of \nPlekhanov, Struve, Tugan and Ulyanov that capitalist development \nwould not be impeded by the expropriation of the mass of the \npeasantry.s \nThe Development o/Capitalism offered a picture of steady, irrevers-\nible change.7 \nThis vista was the most inspiriting of all those painted by Russian \nMarxists. Russian \nMarxist theorists could appreciate that Ulyanov, in marked contrast \nwith Struve, did not praise non-socialist economists like List or \nSisrnondi. Indeed he had been acting \nas Ulyanov's literary agent: the united front of Russian Marxism in all \nits variants had still not been completely broken (although Struve did \npermit himself a brief sally, in late 1899, against the Marxist \nmovement's increasingly hagiographic deployment of Marx's texts).l1 \nAt the time the only Marxist to write a lengthy review of the book was \nP. The susceptibility of capitalism to periodic economic \ncrises was a cornerstone of Marxism, and Skvortsov expressly accused \nUlyanov of misrepresenting Das Kapital. Tugan was centring upon the \ntechnical perfectibility of capitalism, Lenin upon the revolutionising \neffects of capitalism's growth.26 \nTHE PARTY IN RUSSIA \nThe intrinsic qualities of Ulyanov's scholarship give the lie to \nsuppositions that his book's economic optimism originated exclusively \nfrom a populistic zeal, albeit transmuted into a Marxist form, to \n Capitalism in One Country \n71 \nforeshorten the schedule for revolutionary change (even though the \nforeshortening instinct was undoubtedly a deep-seated part of his \nmake-up ).

Stirrings towards unification occurred simultaneously else-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhere; and the Workers' Newspaper editors in Kiev summoned other \nclandestine groups to a congress in Minsk in March 1898.34 \nRussian Marxists, whether at liberty or (like Ulyanov) in exile, \nbelieved they were beginning to have their government on the run. Jubilant social-democrats, as the \nMarxists increasingly called themselves, noted that the maximum \nworking day was to be reduced to eleven-and-a-half hours. Ulyanov had \nwritten an entire pamphlet in late 1897, and had it published in \nGeneva as The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats; and in 1899 he \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproduced a series of draft articles ending with his Project for Our \nParty's Programme. Capitalism had yet to mature \nin Russia.3s Mildly remonstrating with Plekhanov and Akselrod, he \nsought the inclusion of paragraphs describing the course of capitalist \ndevelopment in their country. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order.43 \nNonetheless there lingered a nervousness among many Russian \nMarxists about appearing too 'populistic' on the agrarian question. \nAs early as 1897, in The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats, he \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nasserted that 'the struggle with the government is impossible without a \nstrengthening and development of revolutionary organisation and \nconspirativeness' . \nSuch an approach was shared by many former comrades in the \nUnion Of Struggle. \n Capitalism in One Country \n77 \nAGAINST 'ECONOMISM' \nIn his Shushenskoe writings he had sketched a party programme and a \nplan of party organisation. \nIn summer 1899 such views were suddenly subjected to a criticism \neven more severe than by the attack already made by the Youngsters in \nSt. \nAs Russian social-democrats in emigration, they had studied the \nBelgian labour movement and been impressed by the material and \nsocial amelioration obtained through legal methods. Its suggestion was that \nworkers should forget about revolutionary politics and struggle \nexclusively for their own economic well-being. In \n1898 they banded together into a European organisation proclaiming \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \nitself as the League Of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. So far \nfrom advocating an apolitical strategy, every issue carried the slogan: \n'The social emancipation of the working class is impossible without its \npolitical liberation. It had urged \nMarxists to grasp opportunities to politicise the labour movement; and \nit was free from Krichevski's evident belief that peasant newcomers to \nthe factories were improbable material for the organisation of the \ngrowing opposition to the monarchy.61 This to Plekhanov appeared a betrayal \n Capitalism in One Country \n79 \nof Marxism. His suspicions were confirmed in 1899 when Workers' \nThought produced a Supplement. It contained an article by the \nGerman revisionist social-democrat Eduard Bernstein arguing for an \n'evolutionary' rather than 'revolutionary' interpretation of Marxian \nideas. Workers' Thought \nwas accused of Economistic ideas (even though its enthusiasm for \nBernstein signified a rejection of apoliticism).66 Struve in 1899 still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action. Both considered Marxism to be a creative \nscience.6s They justifiably felt that their own adaptation of Marxian \npolicies to Russian circumstances showed that they were not vapid \nregurgitators of hackneyed German ideas. For him, Kautsky and \nPlekhanov were now the world's two greatest living Marxists. Though inexperienced in committee work, the \nnovice had picked up the necessary skills and techniques with \nconsummate ease; and Plekhanov, whose glacial manner had chilled \nall who had approached him as fellow Marxists, was having to treat his \nformer disciple as a leader of equal worthiness and power.", "Marxists_1902": " 5 \nStraightening Sticks \n'ISKRA' IS FOUNDED \nThe need to establish a political party was unquestioned among \nRussian Marxists at the turn of the century. Parties had come into disfavour with large sections \nof the French working class, and many intellectuals too distrusted \nthem: the result was a campaign to base the workers' movement upon \nthesyndicats operating at the factory level. Such an attitude had little attraction for the majority of \nRussian Marxists, at least until after 1905. This commitment \nwas still stronger among the Russian Marxists. The \nundemocratic system of power in Russia compelled certain responses. \nRussian Marxists would have to operate clandestinely. Iskra had a \nprint-run of a few hundred copies; and, compared with the legal \n85 \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconservative dailies of Petersburg, it seemed a Lilliputian affair. He \nwanted to reach the organisers of existing Marxist groups. The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. 2 Reportage on the labour movement was blended with discus-\nsion of political strategy. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in 1900: \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. The new unions would be kept clear of \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. It was printed in spring \n1902. Left to themselves, workers cannot develop socialist \nideas. For the party should strive after centralisation and discipline; it \nshould operate with the techniques of clandestinity elaborated by \nRussian agrarian socialists in the 1870s. Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhad criticisms to make in 1901. Their substance is unknown; yet it was \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nserious enough for Plekhanov to feel annoyed that Akselrod would not \nhelp him to take the matter further. \nPossibly he wanted to avoid the fragmentation of the newspaper \nboard; and he may also have been loathe to castigate a work which at \nany rate attacked revisionism in Marxism.31 Krichevski's writings in 1902 initiated a \ntradition. Ulyanov's attitude to organisation, they asserted, was not \nMarxist at all. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle. \nHe could note also that his works had for years involved a conventional \ncontemporary Marxist perspective of the stages of political changes: \nbourgeois democracy followed by the dictatorship of the proletariat.38 \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. He emphasised the prominent contribution made by the \nworkers themselves in the Russian empire to the formulation of \nsocialist ideas. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in 1901). English artisans and labourers in the early \nnineteenth century had elaborated varieties of socialism without the \nimposition of ideas by an intelligentsia. \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them.42 \nIn 1869, Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. It \nis in the trade unions that workers educate themselves and become \nsocialists, because under their eyes and every day the struggle with \ncapital is taking place.'43 These predictions of Marx's remain unful-\nfilled, as the English case shows. It is that Marx emphasised the spontaneous growth of \nsocialist consciousness whereas Ulyanov's book asserted a require-\nment for rigorous guidance by the intelligentsia. Marx had also spoken \nabout the virtues of communists who 'have over the great mass of the \nproletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, \nthe conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian \nmovement.'44 Evidently his concepts were not as clear-cut on spon-\ntaneity as Martynov supposed and, for that matter, Marx had not tried \nto produce a 'theory of the party'. He was more pessimistic than Marx about workers. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the 1890s. Social-democratic activists formed the \nmost effective clandestine groups; even the catastrophe of 1899, when \nthe police rounded up five hundred undergrounders, was a sign of the \nMarxist movement's gathering strength. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Their pre-eminence in the \ncamp of the forces of opposition to the monarchy seemed unchallenge-\n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nable; and it corroborated their belief that the 'vanguard' class in the \ndemocratic revolution was bound to be neither the middle class nor the \npeasantry but the factory workers. \nBy 1900 he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late 1880s and early 1890s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In 1901 the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries.51 The outstanding \ntheorist and organiser was Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov. \nSocialist-revolutionaries treated them together as 'the toiling people'. Even so, the socialist-\nrevolutionaries intended to press for the 'socialisation of the land' \nwithout delay. Chernov anticipated a lengthy epoch of \n Straightening Sticks \n95 \npropaganda before Russia would move from the 'bourgeois' to the \n'socialist' phase. All that \nUlyanov would say in favour of the socialist-revolutionaries was that \nthey did at least recognise that social differentiation was presently \noccurring in the village commune; he scorned their notion that \ngovernmental action could halt the process. The \nParty of Socialist-Revolutionaries might snatch hegemony of the \nrevolutionary forces. The socialist-revolutionaries could be a more potent enemy: \nthey were infidels.56 Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern. From mid-1901 it was \nstruggling on two fronts inside the party. Lenin' (which he had first used in 1901 in a letter to Plekhanov). Ulyanov-Lenin moved to establish a \ntightly cohesive party.'66 \n Straightening Sticks \n97 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nIt worried Ulyanov-Lenin that the Iskra board had not yet drafted a \nparty programme; in 1901 he pestered Plekhanov to undertake the \njob. Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'. Lenin was no less displeased. Lenin backed down.74 \nThe final version was close to Lenin's draft of 1899; the sections on \nfactory legislation were largely his creation, and the agrarian sections \ntoo bore his imprint. He teased Lenin over his inelegant use \nof brackets and punctuation marks, but the tensions eased between the \ntwo men in late 1902; both were willing to profess contentment with \nthe Iskra programme. It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Lenin and Plekhanov presented a \ncommon front. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode. As yet, in 1902, no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in 1917, when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance. Both also characterised the transition to \nsocialism under the term of 'the dictatorship of the proletariat'. \nPlekhanov mentioned this in his first drafe9 When Lenin attacked his \noffering as being generally too 'noisy', Plekhanov substituted 'the \npolitical power' ofthe proletariat for 'dictatorship of the proletariat' .80 \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration.84 Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed;85 and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin.'87 A further problem indicated a more serious implicit divi-\nsion between Lenin and Plekhanov. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. Martynov was a prominent \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's.91 Lenin's replies were caustic.95 Not so Akimov: he was disturbed by other breaks with \nthe conventional European understanding of Marxism which were \nmade by Iskra; he especially objected to the demand for a proletarian \ndictatorship.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902. \nLenin had to resume the initiative quickly.OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction.'104 Plekhanov backed Lenin. l07 Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. \nMartov disliked Lenin's proposal on the conditions of party member-\nship. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . His member would be someone 'who recognises the party \nprogramme and supports it by material means and by regular personal \nassistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations';llo \nand Martov recommended his own definition as being less \nauthoritarian and exclusive than Lenin's. But there was also a fundamental issue at stake; Lenin and \nMartov each knew what the other meant in broad terms. Martov \nwanted a slightly more 'open' party than Lenin. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. Lenin \nproposed a tripartite structure for the supreme party apparatus. Lenin raced \nout to tug back Shot man with the admonition that 'only fools use their \nfists in polemics' . Lenin's supporter S.us Lenin strove to \nweld the 'hards' together. There were \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany issues which saw both groupings inside Iskra united. But \nPlekhanov and Lenin would not compromise.llS \nThe Congress sanctioned Lenin's tripartite central structure. \nPlekhanov and Lenin thereupon had a stroke of luck. Even Lenin was \nexhausted. The Plekhanov-Lenin \naxis found this phrasing too bland. Plekhanov's counter-proposal, \nwhile permitting 'support' for other anti-autocratic groups, required \nthe party nevertheless to 'unmask before the proletariat the limited \nand inadequate nature of the bourgeois liberation movement'.

The combination of scholarly \naccomplishment and political eminence was not a uniquely Russian \nphenomenon. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia.2 But in fact Ulyanov stated narrower intentions: he wished to \nexamine the process of formation of the Russian domestic market for \ncapitalism. No attention is given to Russia's balance of trade \nwith foreign countries, to governmental loans raised abroad, or to \nforeign industrial ownership in st. Petersburg and the Donbass. Russian industrialists could promote \nthe country's economic advance even without the props of govern-\nmental contracts and foreign loans.7 \nThis vista was the most inspiriting of all those painted by Russian \nMarxists.

But Russian workers had extracted their first instalment.35 The Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty aimed to tug political advantage out of an economic strife that \nappeared to follow a path of inexorable embitterment. Ulyanov had \nwritten an entire pamphlet in late 1897, and had it published in \nGeneva as The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats; and in 1899 he \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproduced a series of draft articles ending with his Project for Our \nParty's Programme.

In \nUlyanov's opinion, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was \nan organisational mess. \nAs early as 1897, in The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats, he \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nasserted that 'the struggle with the government is impossible without a \nstrengthening and development of revolutionary organisation and \nconspirativeness' .

The consensus had been that he was a \ntroublemaker who would come to no good end; and that he was \ncausing most trouble inside his own Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party. 1 In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Central Committee, based mainly in \nthe Russian empire, was to resume charge of a reunited party; and a \ngeneral party newspaper, Social-Democrat, was to be refounded. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. The Liquidators were Russian Marxists who \nrefused to belong to illegal party organisations on the grounds that \nthe police had broken them up and the State Duma and the legal \nlabour movement offered greater chances of political advance. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. 12 \nIn the emigration as well as in the Russian empire, moreover, the \nfeeling persisted that greater attention should be paid to activity and \npropaganda in Russia. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. 13 The Russian \nsecret police undertook sophisticated measures to hunt down leading \nrevolutionaries. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. 27 Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance.31 \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. Supported by the \nrepresentatives of both the Polish and Latvian autonomous sections \nof the All-Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, they called for \nthe convocation of a Conference in the near future. Meanwhile a Russian Organisational Commission \nwas to direct the party in the Russian empire. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised. Industrial production grew sharply \nfrom around 1908, and the Russian recession was surmounted. They had been taught by the revolution <;>f 1905-6 to \nhate the political system; and skilled workers in particular were less \nthreatened by unemployment. But the Okhrana found it no more difficult to \ncrush such endeavours than it had done with Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication. He was convinced that a tightly-\ncentralised party offered the best chance to take advantage of \nRussian labour unrest.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration).49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Ordzhonikidze, I. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. \nOrdzhonikidze and his fellow Longjumeau graduates, Breslav and \nShvarts, who were working for the Russian Organisational Commis-\nsion, found widespread 'disarray' and 'collapse'. 51 This was the \nsituation, according to Ordzhonikidze, in 'the majority of Russian \nprovinces'. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. The fact \nthat in I91 0 there were only about I 0,000 organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions, 56 did not depress him. Even under the regime of Nikolai II, \nhe sounded an exultant note: 'The party is the conscious, progressive \nlayer of a class, its vanguard.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'.59 Already, too, the Russian \nworking class had accomplished wonders in less than two decades. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). Worse still was the situation in Samara, \nwhere Bolsheviks and Liquidators co-operated.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. \nRussian public discussion was effervescent in books, journals and \nnewspapers. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming. The parallel with the \nRussian empire was close.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. Yet the substance of his commentary signalled a \nshift of emphasis in his interpretation of Russian economic condi-\ntions. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. In 1912, newspapers in \nRussia were exercised by one of their recurrent debates about foreign \ncapitalist penetration and domination; xenophobia was rampant. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. Notwithstanding his economic expertise and social \nconcern, he failed to produce much material on the conditions of \nRussian industrial labourers.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. Olminski in his booklet, The \nState, Bureaucracy and Absolutism in Russian History, that the \nRomanov state was the plaything of the gentry's interests. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. \nFeudalism in Russian was state-created and not, as it had been in \nWestern Europe, 'organic'.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy.115 The convoking organs were the new Foreign and Russian \nOrganisational Commissions. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. 117 \n All or Nothing \n19 \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. No other faction except the \nBolsheviks and the Party Mensheviks was present. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Spandaryan went further, saying that those who \nwanted to do party work should do the work in Russia proper. 140 \nMost of the following debates were focused on the Russian labour \nmovement. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. The Central Committee was to be \nbased mostly in Russia: the final resolution defined it pointedly as \n'the Russian centre of social-democratic work'. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. In practice this would mean that factions of the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party which did not accept the legitimacy \nof the Prague Conference ought to be shunned. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. 157 After three weeks of discus-\nsion, the Conference constituted itself as the supreme and legitimate \nassembly of the entire Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 159 \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. Trotski had not given up trying to call a rival gathering of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party, properly open to all \nfactions, in Vienna. The \n'August Bloc' in Vienna included a range of Russian social-\ndemocrats, from a pair of Bogdanovists through to a representative \nof the so-called Liquidators. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. They also lacked the Bolshevik understanding \nof the tactical importance of nomenclature. but it was \nconcentrated upon his factionalism: and it certainly did not include \nany criticism of his attitude to the non-Russian constituent parts of \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. 177 At the Fifth \nCongress in 1907, the Polish social-democrats constituted roughly a \nsixth of the party's entire membership; 178 their radicalism was vital to \nthe success of Bolshevik policies at the Congress. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. Warsaw-based \nsocial-democrats were especially discontented. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. \nNor did the Armenian organisations, which had been affiliated to the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party since 1907, attend. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Iosif Stalin and Sergo \nOrdzhonikidze were Georgians; Y. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. The young Bolshevik, V. Karpinski knew \nthat Lenin, as an economist, divided the Russian peasantry into poor \npeasants, middle peasants and kulaks. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Plekhanov_1899": " Mikhailovski and Plekhanov were \noutstanding in the older generation; and younger men like A. \nBogdanov, V. Chernov, P. It was a nostrum of \nPlekhanov, Struve, Tugan and Ulyanov that capitalist development \nwould not be impeded by the expropriation of the mass of the \npeasantry.s \nNonetheless Plekhanov, Struve and Tugan had ventured little \nfurther in sketching the agrarian sector's importance for capitalist \ngrowth; they descried connections between urban and rural \nphenomena but interpreted them as but one factor among many which \nexplained Russia's industrial drive. \nPlekhanov refrained from comment, perhaps displeased that the \nyounger man had not modified his views on the nature of Russian \nfeudalism.

Fortunately for \nUlyanov, 1899 was also the year when Karl Kautsky published The \nAgrarian Question; and Ulyanov delightedly noted that he had \nanalysed industrialisation in a manner not dissimilar from his own. \nUlyanov and Krupskaya had been among those St. The delegates committed the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party to political perspectives hammered \nout by Plekhanov and Akselrod for more than a decade. Approaches had been made to Plekhanov but he \nhad not yet supplied a draft.3s Mildly remonstrating with Plekhanov and Akselrod, he \nsought the inclusion of paragraphs describing the course of capitalist \ndevelopment in their country. And, in order to combat \nthose like Peter Struve in Russia or Eduard Bernstein in Germany \nstriving to revise Marxism, Ulyanov wanted to insert a statement on \nthe inevitability of 'the growth of poverty, oppression, enslavement, \nhumiliation and exploitation' under the capitalist order. 52 \nPlekhanov and Akselrod did not demur. And Vladimir Ulyanov \njustifiably represented his programmatic and organisational proposals \nas a valid development of the doctrines of Plekhanov. But Ulyanov stood by Plekhanov. Like \nPlekhanov, he saw the party as the political guide of the industrial \nlabour force. Prokopovich.56 But not to Plekhanov. Plekhanov's authority was on the wane. Irritation with Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhelped to push the Berlin section of the League temporarily towards \nEconomism in 1898.57 \nA counterattack was mounted by Plekhanov; and his criticisms took \nlittle heed that the league's dalliance with 'Economism' did not last \ninto 1899.59 \nPlekhanov was wrong to treat Kuskova and Krichevski as politically \nindistinguishable.61 This to Plekhanov appeared a betrayal \n Capitalism in One Country \n79 \nof Marxism.62 \nUlyanov, hearing of the controversy in August 1899, took \nPlekhanov's part. Ulyanov was as \ninfuriated as Plekhanov. He was not trying to be \nfair; he was trying to crush Plekhanov's opponents.65 \nThis dispute was the first truly open breach in Russian Marxist unity; \nand the question was instantly posed why Plekhanov and Ulyanov \nrisked such a rupture. If anything, Plekhanov at this moment was \neven less tolerant than Ulyanov. Both agreed on the offensive against \nthe 'Economists'; but Plekhanov also wished to terminate the state of \nsemi-truce with Struve.66 Struve in 1899 still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action. It is difficult \nto imagine either Ulyanov or Plekhanov doing as Fedoseev had done \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin writing respectful letters to Mikhailovski. Plekhanov proffered advice to \nKautsky. For him, Kautsky and \nPlekhanov were now the world's two greatest living Marxists. He knew Kautsky to \nbe a supporter of Plekhanov's political strategy for Russia.79 As he alighted on the station platform in Zurich some days \nlater, he could hardly contain his elation; he looked forward to closer \ncollaboration with Georgi Plekhanov. Plekhanov lived in Geneva. The only unpleasantness, which was to appear \nimportant to Ulyanov solely in the light of ensuing events, occurred in \nconnection with Plekhanov. Akselrod too adored Plekhanov. \nPlekhanov would not be crossed even in trivial matters. Plekhanov liked the idea of the \nnewspaper; he approved of its proposed name, Iskra (or The Spark).80 \nPlekhanov and Ulyanov came face to face in late July.'81 \nThere were rows about the Jewish Bund, with Plekhanov indicating \nobjections to its inclusion in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty. Plekhanov was touchy about Kautsky (who, Ulyanov surmised, \nhad not opened the pages of Die Neue Zeit to him as often as he felt he \ndeserved). \nPlekhanov was loathe to collaborate with Struve. Ulyanov conceded to \nPlekhanov the right to edit the terms of Struve's involvement with \nIskra; but the days passed by in Geneva, and still Ulyanov had not \nreceived Plekhanov's version. Still Plekhanov quibbled, and only when harried by an \nexasperated Ulyanov at a formal meeting did Plekhanov divulge his \ntrue motives: he did not want Struve's participation under any \nconditions whatever. He had, he \nstated, lost his 'feeling of being in love' with Plekhanov. In any case, the dispute \nwas already prising Plekhanov away from his refusal to have dealings \nwith Struve. Plekhanov threw one of his fits. Plekhanov laid down \nfresh conditions. But hours later they \nsaw how they had been duped, and they took a leaf out of Plekhanov's \nbook: they resigned. Akselrod duly padded round to see them and duly \ntook Plekhanov's side. Another meeting was held with Plekhanov. Plekhanov announced his \nintention to withdraw entirely from public life. Plekhanov conceded the necessary ground.86 Subtle \nmanoeuvrer that he was, Ulyanov had made the vital discovery that the \nway to defeat Plekhanov over Iskra was to avoid open pitched battles \nand to conduct a war of attrition. Plekhanov's bullying days were over. The older emigres would be represented by Plekhanov, \nAkselrod and Zasulich; and the newcomers by Ulyanov, Potresov and \nMartov. Though inexperienced in committee work, the \nnovice had picked up the necessary skills and techniques with \nconsummate ease; and Plekhanov, whose glacial manner had chilled \nall who had approached him as fellow Marxists, was having to treat his \nformer disciple as a leader of equal worthiness and power.", "Marxism_1899": " 4 \nCapitalism in One \nCountry \n'THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA' \nSocialist scholar-politicians had become notable figures in Russian \npublic life by the turn of the century. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia. Subsequent generations \nwould often regard The Development of Capitalism as a comprehen-\nsive textbook on the country's economic transformation in modern \ntimes. It was a nostrum of \nPlekhanov, Struve, Tugan and Ulyanov that capitalist development \nwould not be impeded by the expropriation of the mass of the \npeasantry.s \nThe Development o/Capitalism offered a picture of steady, irrevers-\nible change. Capitalism, according to Ulyanov, still confronted an epoch \nof maturation but Russia was already a capitalist country. Indeed he had been acting \nas Ulyanov's literary agent: the united front of Russian Marxism in all \nits variants had still not been completely broken (although Struve did \npermit himself a brief sally, in late 1899, against the Marxist \nmovement's increasingly hagiographic deployment of Marx's texts).l1 \nAt the time the only Marxist to write a lengthy review of the book was \nP. The susceptibility of capitalism to periodic economic \ncrises was a cornerstone of Marxism, and Skvortsov expressly accused \nUlyanov of misrepresenting Das Kapital. The growth of capitalism, Ulyanov emphasised, \ninevitably caused unrest among the ever more numerous body of the \nworking class. Tugan was centring upon the \ntechnical perfectibility of capitalism, Lenin upon the revolutionising \neffects of capitalism's growth. It was Skvortsov's \ncontention that a national market in grain had existed long before the \nadvent of capitalism; and that Ulyanov's account of nineteenth-\ncentury phenomena failed to show why they should be defined as \nspecifically capitalist.26 \nTHE PARTY IN RUSSIA \nThe intrinsic qualities of Ulyanov's scholarship give the lie to \nsuppositions that his book's economic optimism originated exclusively \nfrom a populistic zeal, albeit transmuted into a Marxist form, to \n Capitalism in One Country \n71 \nforeshorten the schedule for revolutionary change (even though the \nforeshortening instinct was undoubtedly a deep-seated part of his \nmake-up ).

So far \nfrom advocating an apolitical strategy, every issue carried the slogan: \n'The social emancipation of the working class is impossible without its \npolitical liberation.66 Struve in 1899 still held that the workers were the major \npolitical force against the autocracy; and Plekhanov was asked to \nrefrain from precipitate action.", "Social-Democratic_Labour_Party_1910": " The first \nsocialist state had been born. 1 In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910.21 The endless \ndisputes after the Central Committee plenum of January 1910 \ndemonstrated that a comprehensive examination of the party's \ncondition was necessary. Supported by the \nrepresentatives of both the Polish and Latvian autonomous sections \nof the All-Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, they called for \nthe convocation of a Conference in the near future. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. They had been taught by the revolution <;>f 1905-6 to \nhate the political system; and skilled workers in particular were less \nthreatened by unemployment. Nor were the revolutionary parties the instigators. The Party \nof Socialist Revolutionaries had made efforts to recruit workers to its \nranks in this period.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. \nHe felt that the revolution of 1905-6 had demonstrated how quickly \na mass party could be formed.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. 58 \nThe German Social-Democratic Party was the Second Socialist \nInternational's major force.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. One was already \nmature: urban-based, it was headed politically by the Kadet and the \nOctobrist parties and was inclined to either liberal or moderate \nconservative aims. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. 111 At its core were Lenin's speculations on the reasons why \nthe Kadets, as the leading liberal party, acquired so few seats. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. Topics ranged from the worsening material plight of \nworkers (as well as peasants) to the imperial government's project for \nsocial insurance. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. In practice this would mean that factions of the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party which did not accept the legitimacy \nof the Prague Conference ought to be shunned. 159 \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The designation of Workers' Newspaper as the Central \nCommittee's 'official organ' confirmed the demise of attempts to \ncompromise with Trotski and the other aspirants to a broadly-based \nparty unity. Trotski had not given up trying to call a rival gathering of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party, properly open to all \nfactions, in Vienna. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the Fourth Party Congress in \nApril 1906 an agreement was reached, and the Polish social-\ndemocrats entered the larger party with rights of autonomy in the \nterritory covered by its existing organisations and with automatic \nrepresentation in the central party apparatus. 177 At the Fifth \nCongress in 1907, the Polish social-democrats constituted roughly a \nsixth of the party's entire membership; 178 their radicalism was vital to \nthe success of Bolshevik policies at the Congress. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. 182 The Polish social-democrats, moreover, deftly retained \nthe balance of power in the central party apparatus. Warsaw-based \nsocial-democrats were especially discontented. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. 198 The 'party' \ncould no longer properly claim to have organisations in Poland. \nNor did the Armenian organisations, which had been affiliated to the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party since 1907, attend.", "Mikhailovski_1899": " Mikhailovski and Plekhanov were \noutstanding in the older generation; and younger men like A. \nBogdanov, V. \nThe book to confirm Ulyanov's claims as a scholar was The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia.

Parties had come into disfavour with large sections \nof the French working class, and many intellectuals too distrusted \nthem: the result was a campaign to base the workers' movement upon \nthesyndicats operating at the factory level.

The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. 2 Reportage on the labour movement was blended with discus-\nsion of political strategy. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in 1900: \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. In November 1901 the workers in \nRostov-on-Don conducted a week-long series of marches and public \nmeetings. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. The new unions would be kept clear of \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. Another attempt was being con-\nsidered to prevent revolution by means of reform from above. Left to themselves, workers cannot develop socialist \nideas.

Its controversial approach was \nquickly perceived; and the main reason why it did not straightaway \nevoke enormous controversy was that the dispute about the party \nprogramme held greater attention in 1902-1903. Ulyanov's attitude to organisation, they asserted, was not \nMarxist at all. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle. \nHe could note also that his works had for years involved a conventional \ncontemporary Marxist perspective of the stages of political changes: \nbourgeois democracy followed by the dictatorship of the proletariat.38 \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in 1901). \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them.42 \nIn 1869, Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. It \nis in the trade unions that workers educate themselves and become \nsocialists, because under their eyes and every day the struggle with \ncapital is taking place. Marx had also spoken \nabout the virtues of communists who 'have over the great mass of the \nproletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, \nthe conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian \nmovement. He was more pessimistic than Marx about workers. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the 1890s. Social-democratic activists formed the \nmost effective clandestine groups; even the catastrophe of 1899, when \nthe police rounded up five hundred undergrounders, was a sign of the \nMarxist movement's gathering strength. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Their pre-eminence in the \ncamp of the forces of opposition to the monarchy seemed unchallenge-\n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nable; and it corroborated their belief that the 'vanguard' class in the \ndemocratic revolution was bound to be neither the middle class nor the \npeasantry but the factory workers. The \nliberals moved towards forming a party. \nBy 1900 he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. In 1902 he \nfounded his journal Liberation. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late 1880s and early 1890s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In 1901 the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries. \nSocialist-revolutionaries treated them together as 'the toiling people'. Even so, the socialist-\nrevolutionaries intended to press for the 'socialisation of the land' \nwithout delay. All that \nUlyanov would say in favour of the socialist-revolutionaries was that \nthey did at least recognise that social differentiation was presently \noccurring in the village commune; he scorned their notion that \ngovernmental action could halt the process. The \nParty of Socialist-Revolutionaries might snatch hegemony of the \nrevolutionary forces. The socialist-revolutionaries could be a more potent enemy: \nthey were infidels.56 Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern. From mid-1901 it was \nstruggling on two fronts inside the party. Lenin' (which he had first used in 1901 in a letter to Plekhanov). Ulyanov-Lenin moved to establish a \ntightly cohesive party. Ulyanov-Lenin was unrestrainedly militant: 'A \nfight perhaps causes irritation to a few persons, but thereby it clears the \nair; it defines relations directly and precisely; it defines which \ndisagreements are basic and which secondary, defines where there are \npeople taking a completely different road and where there are true \nparty comrades dissenting only about particularities.'66 \n Straightening Sticks \n97 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nIt worried Ulyanov-Lenin that the Iskra board had not yet drafted a \nparty programme; in 1901 he pestered Plekhanov to undertake the \njob. Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'. Lenin was no less displeased. Lenin backed down.74 \nThe final version was close to Lenin's draft of 1899; the sections on \nfactory legislation were largely his creation, and the agrarian sections \ntoo bore his imprint. He teased Lenin over his inelegant use \nof brackets and punctuation marks, but the tensions eased between the \ntwo men in late 1902; both were willing to profess contentment with \nthe Iskra programme. It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode. As yet, in 1902, no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in 1917, when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance.80 \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration.84 Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed;85 and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. Martynov was a prominent \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's.91 Lenin's replies were caustic.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902. Iskra's plans were nearly frustrated in March 1902. \nLenin had to resume the initiative quickly.OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction.'104 Plekhanov backed Lenin. l07 Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . Martov \nwanted a slightly more 'open' party than Lenin. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. Lenin's supporter S. There were \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany issues which saw both groupings inside Iskra united.llS \nThe Congress sanctioned Lenin's tripartite central structure. Even Lenin was \nexhausted. The Plekhanov-Lenin \naxis found this phrasing too bland.

Parties had come into disfavour with large sections \nof the French working class, and many intellectuals too distrusted \nthem: the result was a campaign to base the workers' movement upon \nthesyndicats operating at the factory level. Such an attitude had little attraction for the majority of \nRussian Marxists, at least until after 1905. This commitment \nwas still stronger among the Russian Marxists. \nRussian Marxists would have to operate clandestinely. He \nwanted to reach the organisers of existing Marxist groups. The variety \nof Marxism's manifestations had never been greater. 2 Reportage on the labour movement was blended with discus-\nsion of political strategy. Disquisitions on philosophy and sociology \nwere left to the sister journal Zarya (or Dawn), which appeared three \ntimes between 1901 and 1902. Ulyanov and his fellow writers \nexpected a lot of their readers; they assumed an acquaintance with the \ncurrent arguments and lexicon of European Marxism.4 Ulyanov continued to point to the Economistic orientation \nof Workers' Thought and Workers' Cause. In fact no Russian \nsocial-democratic publication was preaching 'Economism' in 1900: \npolitical struggle against the monarchy was a commonly recognised \npriority. \nZubatov, in charge of the political police in Moscow, had argued that \nthe prohibition of trade unions undermined the regime'S stability by \ndelivering discontented workers into the hands of the revolutionaries. The new unions would be kept clear of \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitics, confining their activity to economic wrangles between work-\ners and employers. Left to themselves, workers cannot develop socialist \nideas. Socialist 'consciousness' \nhas to be introduced from without. For the party should strive after centralisation and discipline; it \nshould operate with the techniques of clandestinity elaborated by \nRussian agrarian socialists in the 1870s. Plekhanov and Akselrod \nhad criticisms to make in 1901. Their substance is unknown; yet it was \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nserious enough for Plekhanov to feel annoyed that Akselrod would not \nhelp him to take the matter further. \nPossibly he wanted to avoid the fragmentation of the newspaper \nboard; and he may also have been loathe to castigate a work which at \nany rate attacked revisionism in Marxism. Its controversial approach was \nquickly perceived; and the main reason why it did not straightaway \nevoke enormous controversy was that the dispute about the party \nprogramme held greater attention in 1902-1903. Ulyanov's attitude to organisation, they asserted, was not \nMarxist at all. Such a party of 'professionals' would try \nto seize power through the bomb-throwing plots beloved of narodnik \nterrorists; it would ignore the Marxist tenet that social revolutions \noccur only when whole classes of the population become involved in \nthe struggle. \nHe could note also that his works had for years involved a conventional \ncontemporary Marxist perspective of the stages of political changes: \nbourgeois democracy followed by the dictatorship of the proletariat.38 \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Letter showed that he did not want a middle-class clique of \nmilitarily-disciplined conspirators. He emphasised the prominent contribution made by the \nworkers themselves in the Russian empire to the formulation of \nsocialist ideas. Brandishing the Webbs' researches, Ulyanov had \ndeclared that socialism could never have existed without direction by \nmiddle-class intellectuals (and that Karl Kautsky had said something \nsimilar in 1901). English artisans and labourers in the early \nnineteenth century had elaborated varieties of socialism without the \nimposition of ideas by an intelligentsia. \nMartynov quoted extensively in order to show that Marx had assumed \nthat workers of themselves moved towards socialism because of the \nnature of the capitalist system which oppressed and exploited them.42 \nIn 1869, Marx had stated: 'Trade unions are the schools of socialism. It \nis in the trade unions that workers educate themselves and become \nsocialists, because under their eyes and every day the struggle with \ncapital is taking place.'43 These predictions of Marx's remain unful-\nfilled, as the English case shows. It is that Marx emphasised the spontaneous growth of \nsocialist consciousness whereas Ulyanov's book asserted a require-\nment for rigorous guidance by the intelligentsia. Marx had also spoken \nabout the virtues of communists who 'have over the great mass of the \nproletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, \nthe conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian \nmovement.'44 Evidently his concepts were not as clear-cut on spon-\ntaneity as Martynov supposed and, for that matter, Marx had not tried \nto produce a 'theory of the party'. He was more pessimistic than Marx about workers. For Marxism had \nheld sway over oppositionist thinking and activity in the 1890s. Social-democratic activists formed the \nmost effective clandestine groups; even the catastrophe of 1899, when \nthe police rounded up five hundred undergrounders, was a sign of the \nMarxist movement's gathering strength. Marxist theory had also made \na mark on the legal press. Their pre-eminence in the \ncamp of the forces of opposition to the monarchy seemed unchallenge-\n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nable; and it corroborated their belief that the 'vanguard' class in the \ndemocratic revolution was bound to be neither the middle class nor the \npeasantry but the factory workers. \nBy 1900 he was talking wholly negatively about Marxism. Nonetheless Struve now regarded liberalism as an \nindependent movement in clandestine Russian politics. Agrarian socialism was again attracting \nsupport; its intellectual troubles in the late 1880s and early 1890s, \nwhen all its vivacity seemed to have been bequeathed to Russian \nMarxism, had not really been death-throes. In 1901 the new leaders \nestablished the Party Of Socialist-Revolutionaries.51 The outstanding \ntheorist and organiser was Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov. \nSocialist-revolutionaries treated them together as 'the toiling people'. Even so, the socialist-\nrevolutionaries intended to press for the 'socialisation of the land' \nwithout delay. Chernov anticipated a lengthy epoch of \n Straightening Sticks \n95 \npropaganda before Russia would move from the 'bourgeois' to the \n'socialist' phase. All that \nUlyanov would say in favour of the socialist-revolutionaries was that \nthey did at least recognise that social differentiation was presently \noccurring in the village commune; he scorned their notion that \ngovernmental action could halt the process. The socialist-revolutionaries could be a more potent enemy: \nthey were infidels.56 Indeed the \ninternal life of the Russian Marxist movement itself already gave cause \nfor concern. From mid-1901 it was \nstruggling on two fronts inside the party. Lenin' (which he had first used in 1901 in a letter to Plekhanov). Why say 'discontent', asked Lenin, when you can say \n'indignation'. Lenin was no less displeased. Lenin backed down.74 \nThe final version was close to Lenin's draft of 1899; the sections on \nfactory legislation were largely his creation, and the agrarian sections \ntoo bore his imprint. It \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould call for the universal suffrage, for an elective administration, for \na people's militia, for the secularisation of the state, and for the right of \nnational self-determination. Lenin and Plekhanov presented a \ncommon front. They anticipated the maturation of the Russian \ncapitalist economy under a bourgeois government constrained to \nconcede political and social reforms which would facilitate the \neventual coming to power of the social-democratic party. \nPlekhanov's preamble stated that 'capitalism is becoming more and \nmore the dominant mode of production' in Russia. Lenin pressed that \ncapitalism was 'already the dominant' mode. As yet, in 1902, no differences in practical policy were \nhinged upon the contrasting phrasings; it was only in 1917, when Lenin \nbegan to call for the inception of the transition to socialism, that his \nhigher estimation of the level of Russian economic development came \nto obtain direct political significance.78 \nNo serious dissension was easily detectable in the discussion about \nthe methods to be employed when socialism was introduced. Both also characterised the transition to \nsocialism under the term of 'the dictatorship of the proletariat'.80 \nBut Lenin had in fact liked the original phrase, and encouraged its \nrestoration. He noted that this was in line with their common \ninterpretation of Marx's thinking.82 But he saw no sense in \nfurther dispute and soon accepted Lenin's view.84 Accordingly dictatorship, for both Lenin and Plekhanov, \nwould be a stern business; neither leader committed himself to the \nprinciple of universal suffrage. \nFirstly, Lenin was keener than Plekhanov to mention the party's \nsuspicions about the peasantry. The future socialist government, \ndeclared Lenin, should certainly attempt to persuade the peasants to \naccede to the abolition of private-enterprise practices. But it would be \nnecessary to 'use power' if persuasion failed;85 and therefore Lenin \ndeplored Plekhanov's lack of reference to the peasantry's 'conserva-\ntiveness' . He had in any case, ever \nsince turning to Marxism, taken a dimmer view of the peasants than \nothers like Lenin.'87 A further problem indicated a more serious implicit divi-\nsion between Lenin and Plekhanov. Lenin's \napproach was far cruder. Martynov was a prominent \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncritic. In \nany case, the party's general premise was that the overthrow of the \nabsolute monarchy should lead to the removal of all remnants of feudal \npractice inhibiting capitalist economic development. Maslov, Lenin's \nold adversary in agrarian questions, pursued the point. His own proposals went \nfurther than Lenin's.91 Lenin's replies were caustic.95 Not so Akimov: he was disturbed by other breaks with \nthe conventional European understanding of Marxism which were \nmade by Iskra; he especially objected to the demand for a proletarian \ndictatorship.96 \nTHE SECOND PARTY CONGRESS \nRussian social-democracy was riven by divisions over nearly every \nbasic problem of revolution in 1902.OO The critics' \ntarget was Lenin. Lenin, already \npleased by the Bund discussion, took as prominent a role in debate as \nPlekhanov.l04 \nMartynov headed the critics, assailing Iskra's editors for implying that \nworkers could not come to socialism without the guidance of middle-\nclass intellectuals. Lenin admitted to exaggerations: 'We all know now \nthat the Economists bent the stick in one direction.'104 Plekhanov backed Lenin. l07 Most critics harried Lenin \nfor offering too little to the peasantry: an interesting occurrence in \nview of attacks on him for being a crypto-populist. But Lenin's \nsuggestions were accepted by a thumping majority. \nMartov disliked Lenin's proposal on the conditions of party member-\nship. Lenin wanted to define a \nparty member as someone 'who recognises the party programme and \nsupports it by material means and by personal participation in one of \nthe party's organisations' . His member would be someone 'who recognises the party \nprogramme and supports it by material means and by regular personal \nassistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations';llo \nand Martov recommended his own definition as being less \nauthoritarian and exclusive than Lenin's. But there was also a fundamental issue at stake; Lenin and \nMartov each knew what the other meant in broad terms. His current priority \nwas to maximise the recruitment of factory workers to the party, \nwhereas Lenin's was to take precautions against infiltration by persons \nwith no intention of active participation in party life. Lenin \nproposed a tripartite structure for the supreme party apparatus. Lenin's supporter S. There were \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany issues which saw both groupings inside Iskra united. But \nPlekhanov and Lenin would not compromise.llS \nThe Congress sanctioned Lenin's tripartite central structure. Even Lenin was \nexhausted. The Plekhanov-Lenin \naxis found this phrasing too bland.

A second kind of \nenterprise was embodied in efforts made by socialists from neutral \ncountries to contact each other. Steadily, however, \nthe ambition of many participants widened and the idea of a \ngathering of anti-war socialists of all nations was born. The \nInternational Socialist Bureau's lethargy incensed such socialists. In June 1915 Liebknecht \ndeepened the rift among German social-democrats by suggesting in \na pamphlet that the party's policy of 'civil peace' (Burgfrieden) for \nthe war's duration ought to be abandoned; he drew support from \ntwelve Reichstag members. Even Lenin, \nhowever, needed allies. The comradely spirit between the Bolsheviks and \nthe Polish left-wing social-democrats grew. It called for a break with the official socialist leaderships \nwhich took such a line, and it indicated that Kautsky and the \nGerman 'centrists' were also to be categorised as advocates of social-\nchauvinism. Letters were also dispat-\nched to far-left socialist leaders abroad in order to make the left as \nstrong as possible at the Conference. He described the \nConference as a means of bringing together the Left and the so-called \nCentre in international socialism. The contents \ncalled explicitly for civil war and urged socialists not to make a fetish \nout of party unity. If we are indeed on the threshhold \nof a revolutionary epoch in which the masses will go over to \nrevolutionary struggle, we must also make mention of the means \nnecessary for this struggle.' For good measure he added, 'you cannot \nmake a revolution without explaining revolutionary tactics. It recalled the Second \nInternational's decisions on war before 1914 with approval, and \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstated that the official socialist leaderships had failed the European \nworking class. Radek and Lenin were starting \nto emerge as European socialist leaders to whom it behoved the \nsocialist parties of Central and Eestern as well as Eastern Europe to \nlisten. Among these sympathisers there were several, notably \nLuxemburg and Pannekoek as well as Radek, who opposed Lenin on \nthe national question; and their hostility grew in wartime as far-left \ngroups in socialist parties sensed that the war might well end with \nsocialist seizures of power. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party's \nprogramme and the pre-war decisions of the Bolsheviks were not to \nbe abandoned. 65 Bukharin and \nPyatakov retorted that Lenin had grasped the wrong end of the \nstick since the United States of Europe slogan was based on the \nassumption that socialists, not capitalists, would be in government. \nThis only stimulated Lenin to pose a still larger question: was a \ncomplete European socialist revolution likely in the short term. \n War's Divisions \nIll \nLenin's answer was no. But such talk was not peculiar to \nsocialists in wartime. \nLenin and Bukharin were even further from influence over general \npolitics in their countries than German industrialists and Czech \nlobbyists in theirs; but the wartime disagreements of the two \nBolsheviks would assume cardinal practical importance in 1917 \nwhen, as leaders of a Bolshevik party in power in Petrograd, they \ndebated the strategy and time-scale for the introduction of socialism \nto Russia. Bukharin looked back briefly to Marx's writings, and these \nappeared to confirm the orientation of Bukharin's thought: namely \nthat the capitalist state could not simply be inherited by a socialist \ngovernment and redeployed for socialist objectives. It seemed akin to anarchism; it was a break with \n ll2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe tradition of Russian social-democracy. Relations between Lenin \nand Bukharin worsened over 1915. \n'IMPERIALISM AS THE HIGHEST STAGE OF CAPITALISM' \nBoth Lenin and Bukharin thought the war to be 'imperialist', and \nwanted to produce an explanation of imperialism.86 \nThis is not the present title, which is 'Imperialism as the Highest \nStage of Capitalism'; but terms like 'highest stage' signified that there \nmight be a further non-capitalist stage (which, of course, was exactly \nwhat was in Lenin's mind).88 \nIn fact, the February Revolution of 1917 took place before Lenin's \nbook appeared in print (as was also true of Bukharin's). The transition \ntowards socialism would therefore be accompanied by war and \nbloody revolution.96 Lenin continued to assert that colonies were crucial for the \nsustaining of profits; and that economic motives therefore fuelled the \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \neruption of the First World War. \nLenin noted that capitalist development in the Russian Far East was \nrudimentary. Even this appeared to \nLenin to constitute too light a verdict on capitalism. Economic stagnation \nwould, therefore, set in under capitalism. \nNor did Lenin's sociological analysis of advanced capitalist \nsocieties display any greater sophistication than before 1914. 103 \nBukharin was unabashed by Lenin's criticism and pursued his \ninterest in those social groups in capitalist society which seemed to \nshow special favour to the politics of imperialism. 105 But \nLenin did not include these ideas in Imperialism. He preferred to \nrehearse the image of the tiny class of powerful, wealthy capitalists \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat needed to be overthrown. Throughout \nthe war, as before, Lenin assumed Russia to be ripe for revolution; 107 \nand, as Social-Democrat announced in its January 1917 issue: 'The \nrevolution is approaching, the government is preparing itself. Russian Marxists were debating this robustly. Talk of the immediate \ninception of socialism repelled him. 122 Lenin believed that only the end of \n'the capitalist order' throughout Europe would prevent further wars; \nbut, like members of the Central Committee's Russian Bureau, he did \nnot expect the forthcoming revolution in Russia to be a socialist \none. She was not \nready for socialism. His plan to establish a provisional \nrevolutionary government of socialists was deprecated by Menshe-\nviks as being essentially populistic; but Lenin had also asked himself, \nin his notebooks, whether there was any need to let the bourgeoisie \ncome to power thereafter. Lenin, after all, desired a temporary socialist dictator-\nship to initiate a fully democratic order in Russia. He urged Bolsheviks to abandon 'the Menshevik \ntheory of stages' whereby a democratic republic had to precede the \ninception of a socialist revolution. Moreover, the winter of \n1916-17 was a period when Lenin began to believe that the most \nadvanced phenomena of capitalist society were starting to character-\nise Russia. 134 \nThe brunt of Lenin's writing about Russia in 1916 fell not so much \nupon anticipated stages as upon the significance of a Russian \nrevolution for Europe as a whole. Before 1914 he had presented \nthe Romanov autocracy's overthrow as a possible means of \ntriggering off socialist revolutions elsewhere on the Continent. The emphasis of \nImperialism had lain upon economic processes which had made the \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \npolitical world much smaller since the turn of the century: everything \nthat happened in one major power had its impact on all the others. \nLenin put it as follows: 'The bourgeois-democratic revolution in \nRussia is now already not only a prologue but an inalienable integral \npart of socialist revolution in the West.J 36 The phrasing is neither \nneat nor precise, but, if it means anything at all, it surely signifies \nLenin's adoption of the opinion that an anti-autocratic revolution in \nRussia was not one of several possible detonators of 'the socialist \ntransition' in the advanced industrial nations but rather a fuel whose \nabsence would render ignition impossible.

Throughout the First World War, socialist journals \ncontinued publishing. 21 But \nLenin's day-to-day preoccupation was not so much with general \npolitics and social life as with the factional strife among Europe's \nsocialists after the Zimmerwald Conference of September 1915. He feared that Kautsky might emerge as the leader of a \nmass German anti-war movement; and what happened in Germany, \nin the eyes of the Zimmerwald Left, was crucial to the prospects of \nEuropean socialist revolution. Radek stood up to present a rival project, \ncobbled together by Russian Bolsheviks, the Polish left socialists \nand the German social-democrats from Bremen. Lenin passed a note back to him stating yet again that only \npolitical revolution would suffice to terminate the war. In reality, he insisted, a split in the \ninternational socialist movement had already occurred. Martov \ndeclared that, if there was a problem in inter-socialist relations, then \nthe Bolsheviks had helped to cause it. 'Socialist pacifism' was \ndeprecated. The emphasis was also made that workers would \ninfluence the course of the war only by 'vigorous action directed \ntowards the capitalist class's overthrow'. At \none moment he was anticipating upheaval in Russia, at another in \nSwitzerland, 52 but the country which he most usually expected to \ninitiate the European socialist revolution was Germany. In 1915 he \nhad denied 'that the victory of socialism in one country is impossible' \n(although he still assumed that the full achievement of socialism \nwould require its dissemination to more countries than just one).53 \nHe did not nominate a country where socialism might first triumph, \nbut he must have had Germany in mind. The passage continues as \nfollows: 'The victorious proletariat of that country, having expro-\npriated the capitalists and organised socialist production, would \nstand up against the capitalist remainder of the world, attracting to \nits cause the oppressed classes of other countries.55 \nUntil January 1917, Lenin did not ponder exactly how the \ninception of socialism, wherever it took place, would be under-\ntaken; the future dictatorship of the proletariat lay undefined.57 For the Bolshevik leader, it \nwas Clausewitz's description of the organisational simplifications \nbrought about by modern technology that were impressive (as well as \nhis sangfroid about war and death). 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. The system remained capitalist. Profits still \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \naccrued to large private enterprises in particular. 60 \nUntil 1916, Lenin had baulked at accepting the term 'state \ncapitalism', perhaps because it infringed the premise that capitalism \nby its nature was an anarchic mode of economy. Centralisation \nand state control under capitalism had been augmented; and, \naccording to Lenin, what 'the Junkers and petty gentry' were doing \ntoday could be done tomorrow by 'conscious workers'. 63 As Marxists, Lenin and \nBukharin might have been expected to explore the technological \nchanges that, in their view, had made 'the transition to socialism' an \nimminent possibility in advanced industrial countries. In January and February 1917 Lenin took his own notes \non Marxism and the state. 71 Yet Lenin asserted that \n'bureaucratism' had entered into all public and commercial life since \nthen, including even socialist parties. 76 Lenin called for an innovation of cardinal \nstrategical significance: that the dictatorship of the proletariat should \nbe constructed on the institutional basis of the soviets. In January \nand February 1917 he went further: the workers' soviets were not \nmerely to bring down the Russian monarchy and establish a \ndemocratic political framework for capitalism, they were also to \ninitiate the entire transition to socialism.'80 \nIt occurred to Lenin that such a system, being based upon social \nself-regulation, was hardly describable any longer as a 'state'. Lenin's notes, moreover, took it for granted that capitalist \nsociety is neatly divided into two contending classes, the proletariat \nand the bourgeoisie. \nTHE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION \nAbruptly, from the beginning of March 1917, Lenin was forced to \ntake greater account of developments in current politics in Russia. The revolutionary activists gathered their \nnerve and began again to organise for the speedy overthrow of the \ngovernment. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies.84 \nThe revolt was headed by workers and soldiers. \nBut the revolution was spreading elsewhere. The Petrograd Soviet, \nmoreover, had a Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary majority \nfavouring the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a \n'bourgeois' government drawn from the Duma leadership. There were celebratory \nembraces and evening-parties, congratulatory messages to the \nnewspapers; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nproclaimed that a millstone had been removed from the shoulders of \nthe people of Russia and her subject territories.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government. Bolsheviks in 1905 called \nfor a coalition of socialist parties representing all the workers and all \nthe peasants. \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'A workers' government' had figured prominently as an objective \nin Trotski's writings, which Lenin had previously rejected.97 At any rate, he had severely \ndistorted the conventional Russian Marxist two-stage revolutionary \nschedule. To this he did not own up, saying only that 'the \nrevolutionary proletariat' could not help but 'set itself the task of \ncontinuing the struggle for the achievement of a democratic republic \nand of socialism'.98 This was near to appealing for the inauguration \nof the transition to socialism. The Provisional \nGovernment had to act circumspectly since the Soviet's Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaders had been elected by workers and \nsoldiers who had overthrown the monarchy. 101 \nThe consolation for the Provisional Government was that the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries did not want to take \npower; and, not wishing to unsettle military defence, they advocated \n Unsealed Messages \n147 \na compact with the middle class so that factory production might be \nmaintained. A socialist assumption of power, in their view, would \nlead to civil war. Doctrinally too they were inhibited by the tenet that \nthe country's cultural and economic level had to be raised before \nsocialism could be contemplated. A 'bourgeois government' ought to \ncarry through a 'bourgeois revolution'. Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries aimed to influence policies by providing the Provi-\nsional Government with conditional support, and indicated that this \nsupport would be withdrawn if any deviation from democratic politics \nwere to be observed. 103 Bolsheviks in Petrograd \nat the time of the February Revolution independently felt a similar \ndistaste. The Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, meeting on \n28 February under Shlyapnikov's guidance, called for the formation \nof a provisional revolutionary government of socialists, in line with \ntraditional Bolshevism. 109 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin rued the absence of rapid communication between Petrograd \nand Switzerland. 111 But his most \nsignificant request was for the Bolsheviks to move from 'the first \nto the second stage of the revolution'. Did he mean a \nsocialist revolution or didn't he. Such a revolu-\ntion, Lenin claimed, would not be decreeing socialism or even \ninaugurating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Instead, in back-\nward Russia, it would establish 'the revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants'; and only \ntime would tell whether the workers would show sufficient 'con-\nsciousness' to carry it through. 115 The next day, in the fourth 'Letter', \nLenin stopped talking of the militia and said instead that 'an All-\nRussian Soviet (or a Petersburg Soviet temporarily acting as its \nsubstitute)' should take power. 116 But if the future socialist state was \nnot the dictatorship of the proletariat but a peculiar Russian hybrid \nform, what were the measures to be enacted. Lenin's perennial adversary, A. Semovski, another old \nfoe since their entanglement over the national question before the \nwar, stated that the scheme for a workers-and-peasants dictatorship \nappeared to intimate a coalition of Kerenski and Lenin. 123 The construction of the \nanti-Lenin Marxist case in 1917 had begun. Polemical to \nthe last, he excoriated the socialist centrists under Grimm and called \nfor the victory of the leftists in Swiss socialism. He claimed that, \n 152 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndespite having been mocked for his slogan of 'turning the imperialist \nwar into a civil war' in 1914, the February Revolution's occurrence \nmeant that 'only the blind cannot see that this slogan is correct'. Far-\nleft socialists in Europe in general, and Germany and Switzerland in \nparticular, should be steadfast and optimistic: 'Long live the \nproletarian revolution IVhich is beginning in Europe. \nSocialism cannot triumph there immediately. Lenin declined. Each party or faction tried to outdo the rest in turning \nout a large gathering of supporters; but the co-operation among the \ncapital's socialists in March 1917 meant that most receptions became \nan opportunity for general festivities. Lenin, with a deliberate snub, \nmade no reply but announced the need for 'worldwide socialist \nrevolution'. The challenge to the Provisional Government and to \nits conditional supporters among the ranks of socialism, including \nmany Bolsheviks, was posed on the streets of the capital. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 166 \nMoreover, the First World War and its political repercussions \ndominated Lenin's life after 1914, leading him to reject all persons \nand notions which appeared to him to fail to oppose imperialism in a \n Unsealed Messages \n157 \nfundamental fashion. 169 \nThe April Theses's fundamental message, expressed and re-\nexpressed in Theses One and Two, was a call for a second stage of \nthe revolution to put power 'into the hands of the proletariat and the \npoorest strata of the peasantry'. For example, the fourth thesis \nconceded that 'revolutionary defencism' was sincerely advocated by \na vast number of elected popular representatives in the soviets, and \nthat the Bolsheviks constituted merely a 'pale minority'.' The Bolsheviks should \nconcentrate upon using the new political liberties. \nAt any rate, Lenin contended flatly that the workers' soviets were \n'the sole possible form of revolutionary government. The old state \nmachine ought to be superseded by a 'republic of soviets of workers', \nfarm-labourers' and peasants' deputies'; and payment of officials, all \nof whom should be elected to office and subject to instant recall by \ntheir electorate, should be at a rate no higher than the wage of a \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'good worker'. 174 Thesis Nine called for alterations m the party \nprogramme so as to incorporate ideas about imperialism and the \n'imperialist war' and to put forward 'our demand for a \"commune-\nstate'\".175 In economic policy Lenin had a couple of proposals. 177 This, \naccording to Lenin's eighth thesis, signified not a scheme for instant \nsocialism but 'a transition immediately only to the control by the \nworkers' soviets over social production and the distribution of \nproducts'.184 (It may be thought that the phrasing betrays a \n Unsealed Messages \n159 \ncertain intellectualist condescension; but Lenin wrote The April \nTheses mainly for the party's leaders, central and local, who used \nsuch terminology regardless as to whether they were of middle-class \nor working-class background. Equally striking \nwas Lenin's silence on the economic and social rights and duties of \nworkers, peasants and soldiers. The \nrelations among the respective soviets of the workers, peasants, \nfarmworkers and soldiers were left unclear. It was also unclear \nwhether the workers' soviets would have powers superior to the \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsoviets of the other social groups. ' 190 \nThese were the early days of a revolutionary era and these were \nrevolutionary politics. Many Bolsheviks agreed on the desirability of \nanother revolution in Russia in the near future; but neither \nShlyapnikov nor any other Bolshevik radical had come forward \nwith quite so broad-ranging a schema. The theses instigated a bitter \ndispute among Bolsheviks, and Lenin had made striking contribution \nto the politics of Bolshevism after the February Revolution. \nApril to July 1917 \nFIGHTING FOR BOLSHEVISM \nThe February Revolution span the kaleidoscope of Russia's politics, \njolting the alliances and rivalries among the parties, and politicians \ngained a freedom of choice unrestricted by the Romanov monarchy. the City Soviet. 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.3 Lenin concluded: 'All hopes of a peaceful development of the \nRussian revolution have disappeared definitively.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. 'On Slogans' \ncontained the following pronouncement on the post-Kerenski era: \n'The soviets can and must emerge in this new revolution, but not the \nsoviets of today, not the organs of collaboration with the bourgeoisie \nbut the organs of revolutionary struggle with it.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. He looked forward also to socialist revolution \nin the West. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. He mentioned that 'certain comrades' still believed \ni~ to be 'utopian to raise the ,question of socialist revolution' in \nRussia. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. Whereas Lenin had held forth about the era of \nimperialism and the imminence of European socialist revolution, \nStalin addressed the specificity of Russia. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 39 Trying \nto rescue Stalin, Milyutin suggested a new slogan: 'All power to the \nproletariat supported by the poorest peasantry and the revolutionary \ndemocracy organised into soviets of workers', soldiers' and peasants' \ndeputies'. \nDzhaparidze for ignoring the prospect of socialist revolution in the \n 1.

'52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential. Its main interest was the choice of a new \nofficial slogan for the party: 'the complete liquidation of the \ndictatorship of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie'. Preobrazhenski wanted to \nspecify that the movement towards socialism in Russia was \ndependent on 'proletarian revolution in the West'. Stalin's later advocacy of 'socialism in one country' was being \nbroached in a sketchy manner even before the October Revolution. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. For Lenin, this proved conclusively that \nthe Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were collaborating \nwith the forces of counter-revolution.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. The rising influence of the Mensheviks and \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries induced even Lenin to raise, on 1 \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSeptember, the question of whether a peaceful development of the \nrevolution was possible. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 73 \nLenin noted that peaceful revolutions, while being rare, were not \ninconceivable. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. Thus the 'peaceful \ndevelopment' of the revolution sketched by Lenin would have started \nonly after a violent phase had been endured.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Martov and the \nMenshevik-lnternationalists and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nhad already moved towards accepting the need for an exclusively \nsocialist government to be formed. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. He knew that the idea of a post-Kerenski socialist \ncoalition was gaining in popularity among Mensheviks and Socialist-\nRevolutionaries. He needed 'his' revolution to \ntake place before the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nofficially advocated the formation of a socialist coalition ministry. He was also a \ntheorist, and wanted to put down a general statement on the nature \nof socialist revolution. The result was his treatise on The State and \nRevolution. The State and \nRevolution was the most refined embodiment of Lenin's strategy for \nthe carrying through of a socialist transformation in modern \nindustrial societies. The contents \namounted to a co-ordination and explication of the textual data \ncollected in the notes on Marxism and the state taken before the \nFebruary Revolution. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. Revolutionaries could not \nexpect to come to power peacefully.98 \nLenin's second chapter discussed the viewpoint of Marx and \nEngels on the revolutionary upsurge across Europe in 1848-51. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. The ultimate Marxist \nobjective was a state-free society; but Lenin maintained that the \ntransition from capitalism to communism required an intermediate \nstage of socialism which would be inaugurated by the formation of a \nsocialist state: the dictatorship of the proletariat. Again in 1902, in The Social Revolution, \nKautsky had avoided the topic. Lenin replied that Kautsky had at least \nadhered to basic Marxist standpoints until 1914, particularly the idea \nthat 'the revolutionary era was beginning' (which appeared in The \nPath To Power in 1909). For Lenin, this had come to demonstrate \nKautsky's lack of understanding that a socialist political order would \nbe based on the model of the Paris Commune and would dispense \naltogether with the need for a 'bureaucracy'. It also made Lenin's State and Revolution seem more \noriginal than it was. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. Indeed, Lenin saw himself as offering a vision \nof a totally harmonious and self-regulating society which was \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrealisable within a not too lengthy period; and he anticipated a more \nor less easy, trouble-free socialist revolution. Starting from Lenin's \nassumption that the proletariat would constitute the immense \nmajority in a society undergoing a socialist revolution, he asked \nwhat there would be to fear from allowing the supposedly tiny \nmiddle-class minority to continue to vote (especially if Lenin was \nsincere in saying that such a revolution was inconceivable unless \nmass popular support already existed). The State and Revolution did not mention parties at all; and \nKautsky and Martov were introducing data from 1918, when a one-\nparty state became an enduring phenomenon in Russia. The State \nand Revolution was reticent on the point. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Kautsky put it in a nutshell when he retortc;d to Lenin that \nclasses can rule but cannot govern; and that mass participatory \nqemocracy is utopian. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Russia was not the exclusive \nfocus; and, when he started taking notes on socialist revolution in \nJanuary 1917, Lenin must have had Germany more firmly in mind \nthan his native land. In the first place, \nof course, The State and Revolution appeared only in 1918. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 155 But from September 1917 he \ntended to enunciate a demand for 'the dictatorship of the proletariat \nand the poorest peasants', and it was mainly variations on this \ngruesome and cumbersome formula which were used by him through \nto the October Revolution. 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. Even today it has not become \noutmoded; but we have to apply it to the revolutionary class of the \ntwentieth century, to the workers and the semi-proletarians. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. The \nworking class was to be the revolutionary vanguard. \nNATIONALITY PROJECTS \nLenin beat the drum about the struggle for political revolution, \nsummoning workers, peasants and soldiers to overthrow the Provi-\nsional Government; but the rhythms of the national question were \nnot forgotten by him. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. For Lenin it mattered more.201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin. 218 \nThis concorded with his more optimistic views on the extent of global \ncapitalist development already achieved and on the speed which \ncould characterise the inception of socialism in Russia as well as in \nEurope in general. In 1918 he was to dub it 'state \ncapitalism'; but before the October Revolution he balked at such a \nterm. 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. In \nThe Imminent Catastrophe and How To Combat It, a pamphlet \nwritten in mid-September, he claimed that his economic project \nwould at least be 'a step towards socialism'. 224 \n The Fire Next Time \n235 \nOther proposals put forward by Lenin included progressive \ntaxation on incomes and property; compulsory publication of \nshareholdings of over 5000 roubles; universal labour duty, which \nwould mean that those who did not work would not eat either. Ilin' (Lenin's pseudonym as author of The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia in 1899) had focused on the \nintimate relationship between the respective advances of agriculture \nand industry. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. 237 A survey of peasant \nopinion, which had been undertaken by the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies and published in mid-August, produced evidence that govern-\nmental ownership of land was not in line with the peasantry's \ndemands.240 Lenin's change of policy meant \nthat he was taking up the Socialist-Revolutionary agrarian pro-\ngramme. On the contrary, he thought that, despite what \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries expected, their policy would in effect \npreside over capitalism in the countryside.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants. Maslov, the agrarian spokesman of the \nSocialist Revolutionaries, was arguing against immediate peasant \nland seizures.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation. He wanted power for himself and his party, and he wanted \nthis power to be directed at the eventual attainment of socialism in \nRussia and Europe. But he \nwas a revolutionary. He \nexpected a considerably harder revolution than he claimed to be \nexpecting, and yet he still genuinely thought that this revolution \nwould not be unduly difficult and that the socialist epoch was \nimminent in Europe. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader. 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. \nLiberals and conservatives were barely different shades of the same \nphenomenon; and such socialists as entered governmental coalitions \nwith them or even just failed to oppose them were crypto-imperial-\nists, or 'social-chauvinists' in Lenin's phrase.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. Not only far-left socialists but \neven many conservative and liberal politicians, in the rest of Europe \nas well as in Russia, considered the disturbances to be signalling the \npossible outbreak of 'Red revolution': Bavaria and Hungary did, in \nfact, acquire revolutionary socialist administrations in 1919. 21 \nAnd so Lenin was obliged to enunciate what he would do if, \nshould he come to power, a European socialist revolution failed to \nensue. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 26 Yet these differences shrank into \ninsignificance alongside the agreement of Lenin and nearly all his \nc~lleagues that a series of socialist insurrections in Europe was on the \nimmediate agenda and that capitalism's day was nearly over; they \ntook it as axiomatic that an administration of revolutionary socialists \nwould very soon be set up in Berlin. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. \nThirdly, and most importantly, his public statements from mid-June \nright through to the October Revolution entirely ceased to commit \nhis party to war in the event that the continental socialist revolution \ndid not take place. 37 On 30 August, he wrote to the Central Committee \nreindicating his adherence to a policy of revolutionary war if the \nEuwpean socialist revolution did not occur. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. 39 The inclina-\ntion to talk about peace and play down the theme of a possible \nrevolutionary war grew stronger after the February Revolution, and \nLenin followed rather than led his colleagues in this.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment. He was right to declare that the controls over \ncapitalism introduced by Menshevik ministers in summer 1917 were \nineffectual, and that the concessions on the land question extracted \nfrom the Cabinet by the Socialist Revolutionaries did not radically \nalter the rural economic order. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them.66 Every revolutionary party needed money. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. The 'masses' could not be \nentrusted with their own revolution. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. 146 \nThe October Revolution in Petrograd on 25 October 1917 was \nviolent, but, by the standards of revolutions, fairly bloodless. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. Yet Dan and Chernov, guiding the majority of Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Mensheviks, disagreed. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform. 166 \nAnd Martov's speech, according to the Socialist-Revolutionary \nnewspaper, drew warm applause from a majority in the hall. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. Trotski \nand Lenin, joint architects of the October Revolution, shared the \nstage; and Lenin, to tumultuous applause, introduced the proceed-\nings and laid the 'Decree on Peace' and the 'Decree on Land' before \nthe Congress. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. 187 \nThis was as near as Lenin could go towards a call for international \nsocialist revolution without aggravating the already great risk that \nhis decree would not be published outside Russia. 189 These generalisations were accompanied by a \nword-by-word reproduction of the 242 'peasant instructions' colla-\nted by the Socialist Revolutionaries. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. Laws to nationalise banks and \nindustrial syndicates, which Lenin had talked of before the October \nseizure of power, had yet to be formulated. 9 The View from \nPetrograd: November to \nDecember 1917 \nNEGOTIATIONS ON POWER \nThe 'October Revolution' was not a single act which titanically \nprescribed the entire political process for the rest of the country. \nRussia and its subject regions in 1917 experienced myriads of further \nrevolutions after the fall of the Romanov dynasty, in cities, in the \narmed forces, and in the villages. Consequently, the Bolshevik Central Committee, with \nmuch skill and not a little luck, linked its political revolution in \nPetrograd to the revolutions elsewhere. There was a parallelism of \nintent: the various revolutions shared an antipathy to the policies of \nthe Provisional Government and a belief that a radical alternative \nshould be sought. Yet the Bolshevik Central Committee appreciated \nthat, in the disintegrated and localised condition of politics at the \ntime, the Petrograd seizure remained as yet a local revolution. \nIn those first weeks it was unclear whether the Bolshevik-led \nrevolution in Petrograd would prove adequate to guide and \ndominate the others. The great question of coalition with \ncompeting socialist parties was unanswered. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. \nAnd yet both Lenin and Trotski had returned from emigration, \nand their activity in late October gave them a directing influence over \nthe design of the government and its policies which emerged from the \nuprising in Petrograd. The title of Lenin's letter to the Central \nCommittee, 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power', gave an enormous \nhint about his aims; and his endless criticism and ridiculing of the \nMensheviks as being a 'petit-bourgeois party' in pursuit of 'social-\nchauvinism' was scarcely an attitude conducive to co-operation with \nthem. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out. 2 \nEven so, it is mysterious why so many leading Bolsheviks stayed \nblissfully unable to recognise the extent of Lenin's intransigence. 3 It took the October \nRevolution to expose the fact that Lenin and Trotski were political \nliteralists.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. \nLenin found it hard enough to keep his own Bolsheviks united in the \nwinter of 1917-18, and the dispute over the signature of a separate \npeace in March 1918 was to come near to breaking up his party. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. 5 \nThe exodus of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from \nthe Congress had eased Lenin's position by permitting the claim that \nthey had implicitly repudiated the objective of a general socialist \ncoalition. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. Negotiations among all socialist parties were \ninevitable. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. The Bolsheviks, he exclaimed, had not made a \nrevolution merely to negotiate it away. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries could now be faced down, and the discussions with \nthem aborted. 25 Lenin was not so abrasive in public. The Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries themselves were beginning to recognise that \nthe Soviet government might not prove to be so ephemeral as once \nseemed likely. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. It galled the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries that Lenin and not Spiridonova had signed the \nDecree on Land, which Lenin unembarrassedly admitted was a \ndecree purloined from Socialist Revolutionaries. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries retained an all-\nsocialist coalition as their ideal objective. Left Socialist Revolutionaries tended to lay a \nlesser blame on the Bolsheviks than on the anti-Bolsheviks for the \nbreakdown of talks. With this mandate from peasant Russia in their \npockets, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries felt able to re-enter \nnegotiations with the Bolsheviks. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. The \nSmolny Institute teemed with people who had come off Petrograd's \nstreets and brought news of the dislocation produced by the October \nRevolution; but Lenin, who had had much success in identifying \nhimself with the cause of the working class, gave little evidence of \nacquaintance with the concrete circumstances produced by the \nseizure of power. While being warm \nand inspiring in face-to-face meetings in the Institute, Lenin \ncontinued to write the austere prose of the theorist of socialist \nrevolution. Some \nsoviets had for months been in the hands of socialists seeking the \nProvisional Government's overthrow. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918. This concern to rouse the local soviets, \ntrade unions and factory-workshop committees to revolutionary \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \naction helps to explain why Lenin, a trained jurist, was vague to the \npoint of remissness in framing the legislation. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. It \nis true that the Socialist Revolutionaries retained much sympathy \namong soldiers on the southern sector. Many \ncarried with them the first information that an October Revolution \nhad occurred and that a leader called Lenin had issued a Decree on \nLand. Lenin lent his support in the \nSmolny Institute, listening to peasant complaints and encouraging \nthem to push forward with revolutionary measures.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. But the \npeasants' surge to take the solution of the agrarian question into \ntheir own hands pleased a Sovnarkom which depended on their \nacquiescence in the October Revolution. 58 \nThe policy was fraught with an unanticipated difficulty: the \nFinnish social-democrats, whose left wing under Karl Wiik had \nbeen expected by Lenin to install a socialist government, failed to \ncome to power. Lenin's letters to Finnish social-democrats before the \nOctober Revolution reveal how badly he misjudged the socialists of \nFinland even though he had spent the summer among them. European socialist revolution was not to be \nthe consequence of Finnish independence, and Svinhufvud rather \nthan Wiik held sway in Helsinki. Lenin and \nStalin continued to goad the Finnish social-democrats into a seizure \nof power after December. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance.71 The Ukrainian Bolshevik leftists, \nwho regarded such suggestions as an undesirable concession to \nnationalism, were displeased. Nor did \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBukharin and the Bolshevik left have a practical alternative. Their \nonly 'policy' was constituted by the objectives of European socialist \nrevolution and a United States of Europe. In Siberia, the Socialist \nRevolutionaries were attempting to set up an autonomous state \nadministration. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. The administration, joined by the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries, was already involved in acts of political repression. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks. Attentive \nobservers of Lenin before the October Revolution can hardly have \nbeen surprised. He had \nurged the need for a system of civil rights and judicial procedures \nwhich expressly discriminated against the bourgeoisie; and he had \ndescribed all parties to the right of the Bolsheviks as mere \nappendages of the Kadets and their pro-bourgeois interests.79 \nBut it was only after the October Revolution that most people who \nsupported the Bolsheviks became fully aware of his ferocity.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. On the contrary, Lenin approved its use by the \nJacobins in the French Revolution; and, at the Third Party Congress \nin 1905, the Bolsheviks displayed a willingness to resort to it in \nRussia if the need appeared to arise.84 There is no firm evidence available that Lenin and colleagues \nsuch as Trotski were hell-bent, before the October Revolution, on \ninstigating a campaign of summary arrest and execution of large \nnumbers of people who had committed no crime but who happened \nto belong to a social category deemed politically inimical to the \nregime. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. Lenin had never claimed that a German \nsocialist revolution was certain to occur literally on the morrow of \nthe Russian socialist revolution. Trotski was already \npondering aloud whether the Russians could carry on fighting if \nGermany failed to have its expected socialist revolution. 103 Lenin, mean-\nwhile, persisted in his silence about revolutionary war. Joffe, who resembled Trotski \ninasmuch as he was a left-wing Marxist who had joined the \nBolshevik party only in 1917. Was \nagitation in favour of revolutionary war sensible. Unlike Trotski, he had never made a point of stressing that the \nRussian socialist revolution would be lost if socialist revolutions \nfailed to break out in central and western Europe. The Germans had had an interest in helping \nthe Bolsheviks to take power, and rejoiced in the news of the October \nRevolution. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to a man and \nwoman, were implacably opposed to a separate peace. The Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere unappeasably hostile to any separate deal with Germany and \nAustria-Hungary. \nThe fate of the October Revolution hung in the balance. But Trotski \nfelt that the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries had no \noption but to prolong the talks and call the bluff of the Central \nPowers, hoping against hope that the German workers would rise \nagainst the Kaiser or that a debilitating mutiny would occur among \nthe German forces on active service; and, for the moment, it was \nTrotski's policy which guided the Soviet negotiators. Lenin, with \ndifficulty, bided his time. Lenin continued to call for working-class initiative, to \nwelcome factory workers in person to the Smolny Institute and to \nproclaim the ultimate objectives of communism. His domestic \npolitical strategy in 1917, before the seizure of power, had been a \ncombination of the revolution from above with the revolution from \nbelow. \nStrongly-held doctrines were not peculiar to the Bolsheviks among \nRussian political parties in the revolutionary period. The question has been asked why \nLenin failed to make a more realistic assessment of his party's \ncapacities in the first months after the October Revolution. Why did Lenin not attempt this in \nthe winter of 1917-18. Would not the pressures for the Bolsheviks \nto become more authoritarian have been smaller. The number of employed factory workers \nin 1921 had fallen to a third of the number in October 1917; and the \narmy in 1921 was being demobilised, whereas in 1917 the outbreak of \neither a protracted civil war or a war against foreign aggressors was a \nstrong possibility. Moreover, a 'capitalist \ngovernment' had set up the state grain-trade monopoly before the \nBolsheviks seized power. The Bolsheviks, as far-left socialists, were \nhighly unlikely to regard a relaxation of controls on capitalism as \nan immediately desirable priority. The entire project of socialist \nrevolution would otherwise seem to them to have a weak \nrationale. Osinski and other \nBolshevik leftists were elaborating an agrarian policy involving the \nrapid collectivisation of peasant households. 123 Poor Lenin. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. Even in The April Theses he had \nfudged the topic of 'model farms' and allowed Bolsheviks on the left \nto think that he and they were at one about agrarian policy. 127 \nThe hypothesis that Lenin had sufficient authority to introduce the \nideas of 1921 in 1917 badly misconstrues the ideological nature of \nBolshevism after the October Revolution; it also neglects the party's \norganisational disjointedness and localism. 128 \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe revolutionary elan persisted. The notion that \nan authentic social transformation from capitalism into socialism \ninvolved the promotion and participations of 'the masses' was widely \nheld. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice. 135 \nHe had believed, before 1917, that the techniques of 'bourgeois \nculture' should be retained in the socialist revolution; his opposition \nto Bogdanov's dismissive attitude and to vague talk about 'proletar-\nian culture' had been deep. It had \nroots in his horrified and belated recognition of the dimensions and \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnature of the economic crisis; it was also traceable to the subordinate \nrole he had always placed on the workers as a social class whenever \nthey acted at variance with his policies. Bolsheviks, he declared, \nshould seek 'to help the labouring peasant, avoid offending the \nmiddle peasant and compel the rich peasant'. Thus Lenin \nmade a quick return to the themes of class war and of the attack on \nthe richer peasants. Lenin before October had \nadvocated ideas resting on an alliance between workers and peasants. 10 The Obscene Peace: \nJanuary to March 1918 \nTHE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY \nThe October Revolution's repercussions endure in many forms: the \npolitical map of Europe was lastingly affected. Yet the October Revolution did not take place \nin a void. The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. If revolutions failed \nto occur in Europe, the chances of Sovnarkom's survival were \nintimately linked to the question of whether any foreign capitalist \npower had the resources and opportunity to intervene militarily in \nRussia. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nAdmittedly, the Socialist Revolutionaries' triumph was not evenly-\ndistributed across the country. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. And only 39 Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere elected to the Constituent Assembly. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. The consequence was an under-representation of the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries at the Assembly, since the electorate was \nwidely unable to vote specifically for them or even to know who they \nwere. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries, despite having won the Assembly elections, was \nriven by internal disputes. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. The Socialist Revolu-\ntionary agenda was accepted by a vote on the floor, and the \nBolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries walked out in \nprotest. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. \nMany Socialist Revolutionaries were to fight against the Reds, not \nbecause they shared the aims of generals from the old imperial \nregiments but in pursuit of rectifying the great wrong done to their \nparty at the Tauride Palace. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. The numerical weakness of Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies at the Assembly meant that they were even less disposed to mourn \nits passing; and many were like P. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. As soon as \nhe had achieved his objective, he turned calmly to deal with the \nalliance with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition.32 The Bolsheviks \nwould predictably dominate it since they held even more town and \ncity soviets than in October 1917. In \nfact, the division between Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries had become so deep that two fully separate \nCongresses of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies were held simultan-\neously. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. At the same \ntime, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were not going to be \naccorded any greater number of seats in Sovnarkom itself than \nbefore. The Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were as naive about the Bolshevik central leader-\nship's ruthlessness as the Socialist Revolutionaries had been about \nLenin's disregard for the rights of the Constituent Assembly; but at \n The Obscene Peace \n311 \nthe time they thought the deal worth making since the Bolsheviks \nwere willing to offer them compromises on the single act of \nlegislation, then under preparation, that most interested them: the \nBasic Land Law. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries were nervous about peasant feelings \nand on 6 December the new tax law was amended to allow local \nsoviets to exempt the poorer sections of the population from all \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntaxation. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries also successfully \nstipulated that the peasants should receive land according to the \nnumber of mouths to feed in each household. The Bolsheviks had \nwanted to base transfers of property to a greater extent with an \nincrease of productivity in mind; but the need to reconcile their \npartners in Sovnarkom forced them to give way. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists.63 A state-managed industrial sector seemed \nto most Bolshevik leaders the cure for this problem. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists.66 \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Council's ameliorative impact on the industry and trade was \nnegligible. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. It \nreturned to prominence as the depth of the economic crisis was \nregistered by Sovnarkom and as the hopes of succour from fraternal \nsocialist revolutions lessened. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.89 The vote in favour of \nprocrastinating and hoping for the outbreak of a German socialist \nrevolution was passed by twelve against one.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened. Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. [Lenin]. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. But his international policy of 1918 came \nout well in comparison with the suggestions of his Left Communist \nopponents. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. So \n 328 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhy bend the knee to the German high command at Brest-Litovsk.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. 147 But the Left Communists were \nhopelessly divided. He \ndenied that he thought the German socialist revolution would break \nout within a day or two. 149 He could easily have mentioned that it \nhad been Lenin, not Radek, who had claimed that a mere change of \nparty leadership in Germany could have brought the workers on to \nthe streets for revolutionary action. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. The motion called for 'the most energetic, \nmercilessly decisive and draconian measures to raise the self-\ndiscipline and discipline of the workers and peasants of Russia'; it \ndeclared that 'a liberationist, patriotic socialist war' was unavoidable, \nand that universal military training should be put in hand. Lenin \ngave a joint report on two further issues: the revision of the party \nprogramme and the change of the party's name. The themes of The State and Revolution were \nrehearsed. Lenin, denouncing 'bourgeois democratism', called for a \nnew type of democracy based on the Russian soviets. These leftists had \nwanted to scrap all vestiges of the reform proposals in the existing \nparty programme on the grounds that they had been formulated in \n1903 with a future bourgeois revolution rather than a socialist \nrevolution in mind. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. His triumph at the Party Congress had \ndamaged relations with the Left Communists, and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were destined to leave Sovnarkom. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. \nAnd in south-eastern Russia, the Socialist Revolutionaries were \nmustering to establish an alternative Russian government consisting \n The Obscene Peace \n333 \nof deputies from the dispersed Constituent Assembly. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. Before the February Revolution, he had been a \nfactionalist and a theorist. Thus \nthe Okhrana, by arresting revolutionaries and severely constricting \nthe freedoms of the illegal labour movement, made a Lenin possible. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. He managed, too, to appeal at last both to sophisticated far-\nleft socialist intellectuals and to ordinary factory workers. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. He brushed aside all criticism with the \ndeclaration that the policies of the Mensheviks and the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had had their opportunity in government before the \nOctober Revolution, and they had failed. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world. The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In 1918 the Bolshevik-led \nReds had fought against the armies assembled by the Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in the Volga. The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation.4 Other Bolsheviks who had \nadvocated the same treaty were not immune from a subsequent \ncompulsion to prove their revolutionary credentials by advocating \nrisky ultra-leftist putsches. Zinoviev, who had an additional stain on \nhis record for having opposed the October Revolution, was to behave \nin this fashion when calling for a German communist seizure of power \nin 1923. The Bolsheviks would be \ndisclosing a desire to use their armies to envelop Europe in political \ndisturbances and insurrections. They, moreover, shared the \nassumption that the October Revolution in Russia would expire unless \nfraternal revolutionary states were established elsewhere in Europe; \nthey had also become loath to challenge Lenin's general judgement: by \n1920 it was accepted in the Central Committee that he had been right \nabout the October Revolution and the treaty ofBrest-Litovsk. Lenin \nwas furious. In late July 1920 it \nlooked to Lenin and to many governments in the West that he might \nwell succeed. \n'THE INFANTILE DISEASE OF\"LEFTISM\" IN COMMUNISM' \nIn April and May 1920, in advance of the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, Lenin composed a pamphlet of thirty \nthousand words. 17 \nThe pamphlet began with a declaration: 'At the present historical \nmoment, the situation is precisely that the Russian model displays \nsomething - and something extremely essential - to all countries about \ntheir inevitable and not distant future.' 18 The October Revolution \nshowed, he argued, that socialism required 'the most merciless war' to \nbe waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. The harshness of the Romanov \nmonarchy had forced Russian socialist theorists into becoming emigres \nand thus brought them into contact with the rest of the world's latest \nideas, and the years before 1917 saw the Bolsheviks test these out \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintensively in a variety of activities: illegal and legal work; small party \ngroups and mass organisation; parliamentarianism and terrorism. The German left-wing communists \naimed at a dictatorship of the proletariat wherein the proletariat held \ndirect power.25 \nLenin was scathingly realistic: 'We can (and must) begin to construct \nsocialism not from human material which exists in fairy-tales and is \nspecially created by us but from the legacy bequeathed to us by \ncapitalism.27 Lenin repeated his pre-1914 \nargument that, while parliamentarianism would not produce a \n The Tar in the Honey \n123 \ntransition to socialism, no party should pass up the opportunities \nafforded by Dumas and Reichstags for propaganda.29 \nThe German Communist Party as a whole- and not just its leftists-\nwas called upon by Lenin to be more flexible.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. Js Lenin added that 'the \nconditions for a successful proletarian revolution were clearly growing' \nin Britain. \nNevertheless The Infantile Disease of 'Leftism' was a milestone in the \ndevelopment of international communism. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.3 \nTHE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERNATIONAL \nDelegates to the Second Communist International Congress congre-\ngated in Moscow in summer 1920 and, in deference to Petrograd's \nstatus as the birthplace of the October Revolution, they took the train \nto the north and assembled in the Smolny Institute on 19 July 1920.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. For Bauer \ncontended that Bolshevism, while being suited to the peculiar \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconditions of Russia, ill-befitted the rest of industrial Europe. The colonies of the European \npowers had predominantly non-industrial and pre-capitalist econo-\nmies, and Lenin had usually called on his party to support 'bourgeois-\ndemocratic liberation movements' in them. His modified submission \nto the Communist International Congress demanded that support be \ngiven to the 'revolutionary movement' in colonies and not to the \n'bourgeois-democratic liberation movement'. As yet he \nhad never explained how socialism would be introduced to countries \nwhich were not already capitalist. Capitalism, Lenin maintained, could not be \nleapt o'er. Only subsequently \ncould there be socialism.61 In mid-1920, faced with Communist \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \nInternational comrades from entirely non-industrialised countries, he \nhad had to re-think his strategy. In 1917 \nhe had still been contending that capitalism already existed to a very \nlarge extent in the former Russian empire. The strategy of the Bolshevik leader in the October \nRevolution was replete with inchoateness and contradictions; but, at \nleast in some respects, it was premised on the capacity of a Russia \nwhich was not fully industrialised to move directly, even if gradually, \ntowards a socialist order. In particular, Marx had \nwritten letters of encouragement to the Russian agrarian socialists (or \nnarodnikl). Marx had insisted that there was no uniform 'Marxist' \ntheory of stages; and that, if socialists were to obtain and hold power in \ncontemporary non-capitalist Russia, they might even be able to \ninaugurate a socialist society based on the peasant land communes. \nHis proviso was that such a revolution would require support from \nproletarian revolutions in the economically-advanced countries of the \nWest. After all that \nLenin had said about Europe's 'social-chauvinists' and his schismatic \nbehaviour in 1917, the British comrades were as much mystified \nas annoyed.93 \nBy the closing rally on 7 August 1920 the Bolsheviks could look back \non a Congress where no attempt at any basic alteration of their \nimperious proposals had been successful. It was a triumph for \nBolshevism and for Lenin in particular. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. Such unpleasantnesses as existed about them would presumably \nbe mollified by more cultured socialist revolutions abroad. Lenin and \nfriends had breached the walls of global capitalism. Long live the October \nRevolution. Lenin, as leader of party and \ngovernment, was the obvious subject. A cult of Lenin was in the making. The Communist \nManifesto had stressed that class struggle was the essence of \n 132 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrevolutionary action; and, in the 1850s, Marx had written extensively \non the impact of broad social interests on the fortunes of great leaders. \nThis attitude was superseded after October 1917.98 There had anyway been a tradition \nwithin Bolshevism to accentuate the need to train individuals to supply \nthe leadership for the achievement of socialism. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery.99 Its rationale \nfor focussing attention on the living Lenin was provided by Mikhail \nOlminski, who had written a biographical piece on him for a Moscow \nBolshevik newspaper in mid-1917 and who in 1918 called for Lenin to \nbe studied as the incarnation of 'the colossal revolutionary proletarian \ncollective' . 103 \nThe attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918 was followed by \noutpourings about his preciousness to the party. He did not stop trying to identify himself \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith the working class after the October Revolution. 121 \nThat Lenin should have impressed this upon Levi was remarkable \nenough: the advocate of'European civil war' in 1914-1917 had become \nthe supporter of a Burgfrieden between the German bourgeoisie and \nworking class. In particular, his altercations with Levi \nshowed a recognition that socialist revolution in Germany might be \nmore difficult to bring about than elsewhere. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. They assumed \nthat the Bolsheviks were internationalist in ideology but Russians in \nintention. 136 Lenin demanded that a militant \nmanifesto should be issued. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. \nInvoking Marx and The Communist Manifesto, he declared that policy \nshould be based upon the priority to foster worldwide socialist \nrevolution. \nRevolutionary wars were correct in principle; revolutionary crises were \ngrowing in Italy and elsewhere. The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. A \nseizure of power there by socialists continued to be regarded as crucial \nto the flourishing of the Soviet regime, and Clara Zetkin was invited to \naddress the Party Conference in connection with recent developments.' 189 The blame for overestimating the chances of immediate \nsuccess for European socialist revolution was laid at Lenin's door. This had not \nhappened since before the October Revolution.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin. It is true that practically all prominent \nBolsheviks, including those of a practical bent like Stalin, had \npretensions as Marxist theorists. His protege had disappointed \nhim, in 1916, when their views on the strategy for socialist revolution \nhad diverged. This continued to be the case after the October Revolution. 204 He had forgiven him his Left Communism in 1918. Lenin himself wrote in the jargon of \ncontemporary Marxism, often with tedious prolixity; but he would \nnever have allowed himself to refer, for example, to wartime economic \ncollapse as 'expanded negative reproduction'207 or to the effects of \nBolshevik policy in 1918-1920 as 'the resurrection of industry in a \nsocialist formu1ation'. \nMarxism)'. Lenin tried to sugar the pill. The phrase that state \npower was 'concentrated and organised social force' appealed to Lenin.223 For Lenin, this was tantamount to \nrecognising that sociologists such as Max Weber and Roberto Michels \nwho had accentuated the importance of status over economic condition \nhad been right and Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrong.227 This was anathema to Lenin as a \nstrategy of revolutionary change, and he derided Bogdanov's ideas on \n'proletarian culture' as themselves being 'bourgeois and reaction-\nary\u2022.22H \nThe necessity for the working class to undergo cultural development \nafter the October Revolution had been asserted by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution in mid-1917. He wanted culture under socialism to break decisively with the \nculture of the bourgeoisie, which he deemed inimical to socialism and \nto the interests of the working class.234 Lenin in turn refused. On 9 October 1920 he wrote to Lenin: 'I \npersonally consider that to \"conquer\" bourgeois culture in its entirety, \nwithout destroying it, is as impossible as \"conquering\" the bourgeois \nstate.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power. That it did not take place \nin the winter of 1920--1921 is attributable to the onset of the most \ndangerous political crisis confronting the party since the October \nRevolution.", "Socialist_Revolution_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Probably there would eventually have been a \nrevolution. In mid-1914, before the war, there was no economic \ncrisis. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. 10 His \ninclination hardened as it became evident that not only the German \nsocial-democrats but nearly all other socialist parties in Europe \ndeclined to oppose their respective country's entry into the war. \nMost French and British socialists saw the war as a tragic national \nnecessity. Not all socialist groups were swept up \nby the pro-war and patriotic frenzy. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort. The general desire to hold to an 'internationalist' perspective \nprevailed among most socialist activists regardless of party alle-\ngiance. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. \nApparently he had written an 800-word draft of 'Tasks of \nRevolutionary Social-Democracy in the European War', before \nreaching Switzerland, in the last days of August 1914. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. Socialism and the revolution, \nhe declared, had been betrayed. Socialists ought to respond \nby preparing for a 'revolutionary war'. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The first wartime issue of Social-Democrat, no. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Socialist \nseizures of power would become possible. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. 58 The introduction of socialism had to be conceived in \nterms of Europe as a whole. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war.'64 They too expected the war to induce Europe's long-\nawaited socialist revolution. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective.74 The second \npamphlet, Socialism and the War, was co-authored in August 1915 \nwith Zinoviev. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. Supposedly, revolution in Europe \nhad been possible. A minority of Europe's \nsocialists had sustained the line of International; the majority, as \nLenin increasingly pointed out, had broken it. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. But the \nunrest faded rapidly after the emperor declared war on Germany and \nAustria-Hungary.80 The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before 1914 in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. 84 Plekhanov highlighted how isolated the \nGerman far-left socialists under Karl Liebknecht were in the Ger-\nman Social-Democratic Party, and he suggested that German \nsocialism's doctrines would quickly be 'revised' in favour of a more \nexplicit nationalism in the event of a German victory in the war.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914. The ascendant \nparty leadership called itself social-democratic. It had \nbecome a 'political detachment of the bourgeoisie'.94 The rightward \nshift of the German Social-Democratic party was not imaginary. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. In Socialism and the War \nhe made his objective explicit. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' .95 Under such a slogan, no \nnon-Marxist would belong. \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. And, after the initial rallying around the \ngovernment after the declaration of war, industrial conflict returned. Not only liberal but also \nsocialist politicians exploited the committees for their own ends. Industrial conflict \noccurred frequently in the last months of 1915. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. The war was \ndefined as imperialistic; all socialists were called upon to oppose their \ngovernments; multilateral defeatism was accepted as policy; and the \nidea that a democratic peace was achievable without revolution \nacross Europe was rejected. If national \neconomies were becoming inextricably enmeshed with each other, \nthen revolution in any single country would have immediate and \nprofound repercussions elsewhere. 109 Kommunist was intended to provide a forum \nof Marxist intellectual discussion and to attract participation from \nleft-wing, anti-war socialists from other countries. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. The International Socialist \nBureau was virtually inoperative. In spring 1915, \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. \nFeuerbach: all to trace Marxism to its theoretical underpinnings.

Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters.

Initially he had \nLenin's support. His commitment to European \nsocialist revolution, strong as it was, was subsumed under the priority \nfor the survival of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. If European socialist \nrevolution was still his hope, he was equally determined to attract \ncapital investment in Russia from foreign entrepreneurs. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. Militarisation of labour, for Lenin, was a regrettable necessity \nand not a policy to glory in. Lenin was \ncunning. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism. The bourgeoisie had taken and kept \npower in their revolutions without prior administrative experience, and \nthe workers would be able to cope equally well.'138 Sapronov prophesised that the result would be 'the \ndictatorship of the party bureaucracy' . Finishing his remarks on the \neconomy, Lenin triumphantly proclaimed: 'We shall manage to resolve \nthis problem just as victoriously as we resolved the military problem, \nand shall proceed quickly and firmly to the victory of the Worldwide \nSocialist Soviet Republic.", "Socialist_Revolution_1918": " In the factory yard, in the bright early \nevening, he gave a similar speech asking his audience to compare \nforeign capitalist countries with the nascent socialism of Russia.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm. The October Revolution was in \ndanger. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nFictions abounded not only about Kaplan but also about the Party of \nSocialist Revolutionaries.20 It is well with the bounds of possibility that \na group of Socialist Revolutionaries, working independently of their \nCentral Committee, had engineered the assassination attempt.21 A liaison with Socialist \nRevolutionaries might have been acceptable to her. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was to be \noutlawed on the grounds of state treason.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. \n'PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND KAUTSKY THE \nRENEGADE' \nLenin was too frail to write in longhand; but, being determined to use \nhis unsought leisure to the full, he took on a short-hand secretary26 and \nbegan yet another booklet on Marxist theory: Proletarian Revolution \nand Kautsky the Renegade.28 \nKautsky had contrasted two directions in nineteenth-century \nsocialist thought: the democratic and the dictatorial. Marx had supposedly \nmeant only that the workers should retain dominant political and \neconomic influence after the socialist revolution. The other social \nclasses would not be disenfranchised, and Kautsky repeated that the \nParis Commune - which had earned Marx's approval - had not \nabolished the voting rights of the middle classes.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word. Marx and \nEngels wrote much on the desirability of violence to transform society \nwhereas Kautsky assumed that, once the German imperial monarchy \nhad been overthrown, the working class could advance to power by \nparliamentary means.'35 \nThe strongest sections of the booklet lie with Lenin's demonstration \nthat Kautsky had expunged the arguments for violent revolution and \ndictatorship from his presentation of Marxism. Proletarian Revolution and \nKautsky the Renegade was quickly translated and dispatched abroad. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. \nFor instance, Kautsky indicated that the social trends in advanced \ncapitalist societies were moving away from a neat polarisation between \n'the proletariat' and 'the bourgeoisie'.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur. \nWhat were the signs that this revolution was within sight.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe. \nKautsky naively expected to end world wars without the need for \nsocialist revolutions.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years.95 The problem was that no one could predict when socialist \nrevolutions in Europe would occur. In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime. He had implied that \nEuropean socialist revolution was something that he hoped for but \ncould not guarantee. \nLenin meant business. All of us shall \ngive our lives in order to help the German workers in the cause of \nadvancing the revolution that has begun in Germany. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. A seizure of power by the left-wing socialist radicals was \nconsequently to be encouraged. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. Like the Left Communists in Russia, she regarded \nBrest-Litovsk as a betrayal of international socialism which would \nhamper the making of socialist revolution in Germany. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. The coup against the Socialist \nRevolutionaries in Omsk made no great difference to Lenin's way of \nthinking, and he wasted scant words on it. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. Industrial nationalisation, which \nhad been started with the October Revolution, was intensified. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction. The fate of the October Revolution hung in the \nbalance.", "Official_Socialist_1915": " Yet others, who were probably \nthe majority, qualified their opposition to their governments by \n97 \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that they would use their armies in a similar way even if \ntheir war aims were different. The altercations with \nKautsky and with Menshevik theorists over social-democratic \nattitudes to the war were but one manifestation among many during \nLenin's long relationship with Marx. 16 As a senior politician, he felt a duty to contact young \nsocialists. \nTHE ZIMMERW ALD CONFERENCE \nRobert Grimm and Odino Morgari were the first European socialists \ntrying to organise an international anti-war conference who, in \nLenin's opinion, could not be ignored. The earliest of such initiatives \nhad come with a meeting of representatives from the Allied countries \nin London in February 1915 and a meeting in Vienna for socialist \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparties from the Central Powers in April 1915. A second kind of \nenterprise was embodied in efforts made by socialists from neutral \ncountries to contact each other. Steadily, however, \nthe ambition of many participants widened and the idea of a \ngathering of anti-war socialists of all nations was born. The \nInternational Socialist Bureau's lethargy incensed such socialists. In Britain, the Independent Labour Party \nremained a thorn in the side of the authorities, and the Confedera-\ntion Generale du Travail and the Section \nFran~aise de \nl'Internationale Ouvriere had a rising number of anti-war activists. In June 1915 Liebknecht \ndeepened the rift among German social-democrats by suggesting in \na pamphlet that the party's policy of 'civil peace' (Burgfrieden) for \nthe war's duration ought to be abandoned; he drew support from \ntwelve Reichstag members. Thus the ascendant leaderships of the German \nSocial-Democratic Party, the French Socialist Party and the British \nLabour Party received no invitation. Even Lenin, \nhowever, needed allies. It called for a break with the official socialist leaderships \nwhich took such a line, and it indicated that Kautsky and the \nGerman 'centrists' were also to be categorised as advocates of social-\nchauvinism. In his initial draft he neither mentioned social-chauvin-\nism nor referred to the offending socialist leaders by name. His theses did not explicitly \ndemand a rejection of war credits and of socialist participation in \nbelligerent governments. Letters were also dispat-\nched to far-left socialist leaders abroad in order to make the left as \nstrong as possible at the Conference. He described the \nConference as a means of bringing together the Left and the so-called \nCentre in international socialism. The contents \ncalled explicitly for civil war and urged socialists not to make a fetish \nout of party unity. Condemnation of the German Social-Democratic \nParty's ascendant party leadership in 1914 was common to all at \nZimmerwald; but proposals for action were varied. It recalled the Second \nInternational's decisions on war before 1914 with approval, and \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstated that the official socialist leaderships had failed the European \nworking class. Radek and Lenin were starting \nto emerge as European socialist leaders to whom it behoved the \nsocialist parties of Central and Eestern as well as Eastern Europe to \nlisten. Among these sympathisers there were several, notably \nLuxemburg and Pannekoek as well as Radek, who opposed Lenin on \nthe national question; and their hostility grew in wartime as far-left \ngroups in socialist parties sensed that the war might well end with \nsocialist seizures of power. 65 Bukharin and \nPyatakov retorted that Lenin had grasped the wrong end of the \nstick since the United States of Europe slogan was based on the \nassumption that socialists, not capitalists, would be in government. \nThis only stimulated Lenin to pose a still larger question: was a \ncomplete European socialist revolution likely in the short term. \n War's Divisions \nIll \nLenin's answer was no. But such talk was not peculiar to \nsocialists in wartime. Bukharin looked back briefly to Marx's writings, and these \nappeared to confirm the orientation of Bukharin's thought: namely \nthat the capitalist state could not simply be inherited by a socialist \ngovernment and redeployed for socialist objectives. The transition \ntowards socialism would therefore be accompanied by war and \nbloody revolution. Few historians, except those \nwriting with official sanction in communist states, would extrude \nnon-economic factors so sweepingly. \nNor did Lenin's sociological analysis of advanced capitalist \nsocieties display any greater sophistication than before 1914. 105 But \nLenin did not include these ideas in Imperialism. He preferred to \nrehearse the image of the tiny class of powerful, wealthy capitalists \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat needed to be overthrown. Throughout \nthe war, as before, Lenin assumed Russia to be ripe for revolution; 107 \nand, as Social-Democrat announced in its January 1917 issue: 'The \nrevolution is approaching, the government is preparing itself. Russian Marxists were debating this robustly. Talk of the immediate \ninception of socialism repelled him. She was not \nready for socialism. Lenin, after all, desired a temporary socialist dictator-\nship to initiate a fully democratic order in Russia. \nLenin put it as follows: 'The bourgeois-democratic revolution in \nRussia is now already not only a prologue but an inalienable integral \npart of socialist revolution in the West. Nor has any computation been \n 124 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmade of the confiscations of Lenin's writings in wartime.

The emphasis was also made that workers would \ninfluence the course of the war only by 'vigorous action directed \ntowards the capitalist class's overthrow'. The passage continues as \nfollows: 'The victorious proletariat of that country, having expro-\npriated the capitalists and organised socialist production, would \nstand up against the capitalist remainder of the world, attracting to \nits cause the oppressed classes of other countries. 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. The bulwarks of capitalist self-\ndefence were growing stronger year by year, and violent revolutions \nwould be necessary.

Workers \nhad turned against the monarchy in increasing numbers. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were \noperating in the suburbs. But Lenin ignored, or probably more \naccurately, was unaware of, the peasantry's problems. The \nincentive for peasant households to trade their grain with the towns \ndecreased.

Instead, in back-\nward Russia, it would establish 'the revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants'; and only \ntime would tell whether the workers would show sufficient 'con-\nsciousness' to carry it through.

Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 169 \nThe April Theses's fundamental message, expressed and re-\nexpressed in Theses One and Two, was a call for a second stage of \nthe revolution to put power 'into the hands of the proletariat and the \npoorest strata of the peasantry'.

His position at army \nheadquarters in Mogilev, nearly 800 kilometres from Petrograd, left \nhim almost as isolated from knowledge of current developments in \nPetrograd as were emigres such as Lenin. The war-industry \ncommittees, despite being shunned by Bolsheviks on the grounds that \nthey were merely a means for prosecuting an imperialist war more \nsuccessfully, allowed the Mensheviks to organise covert anti-regime \npropaganda. \nTHE KIENTHAL CONFERENCE \nLenin's considerations on Russia at war skirted developments on the \nEastern front. 21 But \nLenin's day-to-day preoccupation was not so much with general \npolitics and social life as with the factional strife among Europe's \nsocialists after the Zimmerwald Conference of September 1915. The \nmandate of Martov and Akselrod to represent any Russian group \nwas, as usual, challenged by the Bolsheviks. Lenin passed a note back to him stating yet again that only \npolitical revolution would suffice to terminate the war. Martov \ndeclared that, if there was a problem in inter-socialist relations, then \nthe Bolsheviks had helped to cause it.55 \nUntil January 1917, Lenin did not ponder exactly how the \ninception of socialism, wherever it took place, would be under-\ntaken; the future dictatorship of the proletariat lay undefined. Largely neglecting Clausewitz's discussion of the \nvariegated aspects of warfare, Lenin underscored the sections \nderiding the pretensions of generals.57 For the Bolshevik leader, it \nwas Clausewitz's description of the organisational simplifications \nbrought about by modern technology that were impressive (as well as \nhis sangfroid about war and death). 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. Profits still \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \naccrued to large private enterprises in particular. In January and February 1917 Lenin took his own notes \non Marxism and the state. 76 Lenin called for an innovation of cardinal \nstrategical significance: that the dictatorship of the proletariat should \nbe constructed on the institutional basis of the soviets. In January \nand February 1917 he went further: the workers' soviets were not \nmerely to bring down the Russian monarchy and establish a \ndemocratic political framework for capitalism, they were also to \ninitiate the entire transition to socialism. \nOn 23 February 1917, International Women's Day, women textile \nworkers went on strike in Petrograd. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. Activists in Petrograd improvised as best they could, \nand calls for the re-establishment of soviets were already being heard. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. Lenin's contemptuous \ndismissal of Russian liberalism as the fifth wheel on the carriage of \ntsarism was harsh but, at such a time of crisis, not wide of the mark. All Petrograd was \nin ferment. The Petrograd Soviet had issued a proclamation \ndemanding the dynasty's removal. The Petrograd Soviet, \nmoreover, had a Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary majority \nfavouring the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a \n'bourgeois' government drawn from the Duma leadership. In Petrograd, Pavel \nMilyukov announced the formation of a Provisional Government; \nand in Pskov, Nikolai II agreed to abdicate. Petrograd dailies arrived only after the \nFebruary Revolution's occurrence. The Bolshevik \nleader's continuing preoccupation was with socialist polemics in \nEurope, and he noted trenchantly: 'There is nothing coming from \nRussia, not even letters.89 \nThe Russian emigration was ecstatic. There were celebratory \nembraces and evening-parties, congratulatory messages to the \nnewspapers; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nproclaimed that a millstone had been removed from the shoulders of \nthe people of Russia and her subject territories. Lenin shared in the \ncheer without Jetting himself be carried away.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government.95 This constituted a \nrupture with the old Bolshevik programme. Bolsheviks in 1905 called \nfor a coalition of socialist parties representing all the workers and all \nthe peasants. In a telegram to Bolsheviks leaving Scandi-\nnavia for Russia, also on 4 March, he restricted his recommenda-\ntions: no support for the Provisional Government; suspicion of \nKerenski; the arming of the proletariat; elections to the Petrograd \nmunicipal council; and no rapprochement with other parties.99 \nHis reference to the Petrograd municipal council, whose impor-\ntance was negligible, demonstrated how isolated he was from \nhappenings in Russia; and he was equally out of touch in imagining \nthat Nikolai II aimed at a return to power by means of a separate \npeace with the Germans. The Petrograd Soviet insisted that the cabinet \nshould promulgate a full range of civic freedoms, hold elections to a \nConstituent Assembly, and fight only a defensive war against \nGermany and Austria-Hungary. 103 Bolsheviks in Petrograd \nat the time of the February Revolution independently felt a similar \ndistaste. The Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, meeting on \n28 February under Shlyapnikov's guidance, called for the formation \nof a provisional revolutionary government of socialists, in line with \ntraditional Bolshevism. But the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary \nacceptance of the Provisional Government prevented the Bureau's \naims from being realised; and the Bolshevik City Committee, too, \nopposed the Bureau. Disputes \nbetween Pravda and the Russian Bureau persisted through March \n1917. 109 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin rued the absence of rapid communication between Petrograd \nand Switzerland. 111 But his most \nsignificant request was for the Bolsheviks to move from 'the first \nto the second stage of the revolution'. 114 The third \n'Letter from Afar', composed on 11 March, showed signs of \nawareness of the transformation wrought by such ideas in the \ngenerally accepted concept of Bolshevik strategy. 115 The next day, in the fourth 'Letter', \nLenin stopped talking of the militia and said instead that 'an All-\nRussian Soviet (or a Petersburg Soviet temporarily acting as its \nsubstitute)' should take power. 121 It is \nconventionally supposed that debate between Lenin and his oppo-\nnents began in Petrograd, after his return to Russia in April. Lenin's perennial adversary, A. 123 The construction of the \nanti-Lenin Marxist case in 1917 had begun. Plekhanov, sailing to \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSweden, took a train through to Petrograd in the company of British \nsocialist Will O'Grady and was feted in a hero's welcome in \nPetrograd. Lenin fantasised about crossing Germany unrecognised by \ndonning a wig and using V. The final number of passengers was \nthirty-two, and twenty of them were Bolsheviks139 Krupskaya talked \nof coming later so that she could wind up factional and personal \nbusiness; but Lenin would not hear of this. Lenin edged back towards a wall and the other Bolshevik \nmen stood protectively in front of their leader. Lenin went on filling his notebooks. 151 This was a joke whose acidity was to \nlose its bite later in the year; at the time it played upon the \nuncertainties of a trainload of Russian Marxists approaching their \ndestination without guarantee that arrest did not await them in \nPetrograd. Lenin received an invitation from Alexander Parvus-\n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHelphand, a member of the German Social-Democratic Party who \ncarried out missions for the German government with funds to \ndisburse to Russian revolutionaries whose activity might destabilise \nthe Russian government, to meet for discussions. Lenin declined. Radek was disconcerted by the thought of the \nleader of emigre Bolsheviks returning to Petrograd in a pair of \nhobnailed mountain boots, so a reluctant Lenin agreed to buy new \nfootwear. \nNothing incriminating was found, and Lenin telegraphed a message \nto his sisters that he would arrive in Petrograd on 3 April. 156 It was \nat Tornio, too, that he obtained copies of the new central Bolshevik \nnewspaper Pravda; 157 and, in the dimly-lit customs hall, he found \nhimself a quiet corner to read them while Zinoviev busied himself \nwith practical arrangements for the journey. Central \nCommittee member Kamenev and other Bolsheviks had journeyed \nout to meet them. Shortly before midnight on 3 April they pulled into \nPetrograd's Finland station. Chkheidze from the Petrograd Soviet greeted him with a speech \ncalling for unity among all socialists. He did this from on top of an \narmoured car requisitioned by the Petrograd Bolsheviks. The challenge to the Provisional Government and to \nits conditional supporters among the ranks of socialism, including \nmany Bolsheviks, was posed on the streets of the capital. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. In fact the \nolder Bolshevik strategy had never been a clear two-stage revolu-\ntionary strategy. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 166 \nMoreover, the First World War and its political repercussions \ndominated Lenin's life after 1914, leading him to reject all persons \nand notions which appeared to him to fail to oppose imperialism in a \n Unsealed Messages \n157 \nfundamental fashion. For example, the fourth thesis \nconceded that 'revolutionary defencism' was sincerely advocated by \na vast number of elected popular representatives in the soviets, and \nthat the Bolsheviks constituted merely a 'pale minority'.' The Bolsheviks should \nconcentrate upon using the new political liberties. 172 Lenin's \nfinessing probably resulted from conversations in Sweden with \nBolsheviks in closer contact with Russian conditions than the \ncorrespondent of Zurcher Post, or from his exchanges with Kame-\nnev at the Finnish frontier. But a thumping brevity was typical, and the tenth thesis was \nrapped out in twelve Russian words: 'Renovation of the Interna-\ntional.184 (It may be thought that the phrasing betrays a \n Unsealed Messages \n159 \ncertain intellectualist condescension; but Lenin wrote The April \nTheses mainly for the party's leaders, central and local, who used \nsuch terminology regardless as to whether they were of middle-class \nor working-class background. 185 This was scarcely a \nplan of detailed guidance for Bolshevik organisers, but at least it \nadvised what was not to be done. The April Theses were the first broad-ranging \nstatement of a fundamental Bolshevik alternative to the policies of \nKamenev and Stalin. Many Bolsheviks agreed on the desirability of \nanother revolution in Russia in the near future; but neither \nShlyapnikov nor any other Bolshevik radical had come forward \nwith quite so broad-ranging a schema. The theses instigated a bitter \ndispute among Bolsheviks, and Lenin had made striking contribution \nto the politics of Bolshevism after the February Revolution. \nApril to July 1917 \nFIGHTING FOR BOLSHEVISM \nThe February Revolution span the kaleidoscope of Russia's politics, \njolting the alliances and rivalries among the parties, and politicians \ngained a freedom of choice unrestricted by the Romanov monarchy. In Petrograd there was sad to be 'dual power', \nshared by the Provisional Government anc. the City Soviet. 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir loyalty to their soviets as being primary; troops on the Eastern \nfront increasingly exhibited the same attitude. Soldiers demanded a relaxation of \ndiscipline and the permission to elect their own committees to \nrepresent their interests; and the Petrograd Soviet issued its 'Order \nNo. \nContinuing to think that socialism in backward Russia was a \npremature project and that national unity was essential in wartime, \nthey hoped to constrain the Provisional Government to act within \nthe limits of policies based on democratic political liberties and \nterritorial defence; and, immediately after the February Revolution, \nmost workers, peasants and soldiers felt likewise. Their votes \nprovided the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries with \nmajorities in the soviets. The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease.7 Returning \nto Petrograd, Lenin was adept in expressing popular attitudes which \nhad not yet fully developed.9 At the beginning of April, this pair acted as major \nBolshevik spokesmen. It was they who were chosen by the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee to put the Bolshevik case at the \nassembly of soviet deputies, drawn from all over the country, which \nmet in Petrograd from 29 March. Kamenev and Stalin argued for \norganisational links with the Mensheviks (who supplied most \nrepresentatives to the gathering of deputies); they also won over \nthe Bolshevik fraction (or caucus) to the policy of conditional \nsupport for the Provisional Government 'insofar as it follows the \npath of satisfying the demands of the working class and the \nrevolutionary peasantry'. 10 Negotiations between the Bolshevik and \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik fractions proceeded on this basis. Yet they were not cringing \nbefore Menshevism either: Stalin made clear his belief that the \nProvisional Government's days were numbered and that sooner or \nlater, after 'a break with the bourgeoisie', the soviets would assume \npower; 12 and Kamenev persuaded the Menshevik negotiators to \ncriticise even the Petrograd Soviet's foreign policy, to call for a \npublication of secret treaties and to repudiate the principle of 'civil \npeace' _13 Furthermore, other Bolshevik speakers emphasised the \nnecessity for a radical series of direct-action measures. 14 \nThe tentative agreements between the Bolshevik and Menshevik \nfractions did not hold. On 30 March, the Mensheviks and Bundists \nretracted their support from the motion criticising the Petrograd \nSoviet. 17 This would have excluded Men-\nshevik right-wingers; and, as Stalin must have realised, neither the \nMenshevik centrists nor the Menshevik leftists would have linked up \nwith the Bolsheviks on such terms. Tsereteli carried a motion of support for the \nPetrograd Soviet by 325 votes against 57 when the Bolsheviks and the \nMensheviks emerged from their respective fractions to debate at the \nnational conference of soviets; he even persuaded several Bolsheviks \nto the right of Kamenev, such as V. Lenin returned home at the moment \nwhen all Bolsheviks recognised the need for a wide-ranging discus-\nsion to formulate the general line of Bolshevik strategy and to put an \nend to all this fluidity. \n165 \nBolshevik right was anyway under persistent challenge. 19 \nIt was in this unstable situation that Lenin, arriving on 3 April, \ntalked into the night with Bolshevik leaders in the party's head-\nquarters in the Kshesinskaya Palace (which had simply been \nsequestred by force). 20 At noon next day he was accompanied by \nthem to the Tauride Palace where he spoke to about seventy \nBolsheviks and read out his April Theses. Goldenberg, despite being Bolsheviks, spoke \nstrongly against him. Goldenberg, a Bolshevik who was moving over \nto Menshevism, shouted: 'Lenin has now made himself candidate for \none European throne vacant for thirty years: the throne of \nBakunin. Yet it was \nTsereteli, the Petrograd Soviet's dominant figure, who offered the \nmost sustained criticism. 28 \nNor, seemingly, did any major local committee immediately come \nover to Lenin's support. 29 Lenin had no choice but to meet and talk \nto as many Bolsheviks as possible. Voitinski and those Bolsheviks \nwho opposed Kamenev's stand against Tsereteli quickly abandoned \nthe Bolsheviks altogether.32 The Bolshevik right wing was severely \nweakened. Furthermore, the Kamenevites who had manipulated \nPravda and buffeted the Russian Bureau in March did not reflect \nthe opinions of all Bolsheviks among lower committees, especially at \nthe district level, in Petrograd. \nThe scheduling of an All-Russian Bolshevik Conference for late \nApril opened windows of opportunity for Lenin. Local Bolshevik \nconferences had to be called and party policies had to be openly \ndebated. Only 15 per cent of Bolshevik delegates to the national \nsoviet conference in Petrograd from 29 March to 2 April were re-\nelected to the Conference which opened three weeks later. Not even the \nMoscow Bolsheviks had dispatched representatives. 35 Almost cer-\ntainly the change of composition as between the national gathering \non 29 March and the Bolshevik April Conference also reflected the \nfact that rank-and-file Bolsheviks, when their opinion was consulted, \nchose leaders who approved of radical alternatives to Kamenev's \npolicies. The balance of opinion \namong the Bolsheviks was swinging his way, and The April Theses \naccelerated the process. The \nPetrograd Bolsheviks met on 14 April. 38 Lenin \nalso modified his presentation at the Petrograd City Conference \nitself.44 \nHow representative were the Petrograd Bolsheviks in their move-\nment towards The April Theses is not yet known with precision; but, \nvery probably, party committees elsewhere in the country inclined in \nLenin's favour for similarly mixed motives, and not all of these \nimplied total submission to Lenin's will.45 Nor, of course, did the \nBolsheviks debate strategy in a political vacuum. At the Petro grad City Conference, \nY.46 Workers and soldiers, as all Bolsheviks \nwere aware, were still busily extending their rights; and already there \nwere signs that wage settlements would not keep pace with inflation.47 In such circumstances it was \nhard for Kamenev to win over the Bolsheviks with ideas of even \nconditional support for the Provisional Government.48 The Bolshevik Central Committee, at \nLenin's instigation, had encouraged the protest demonstration and \nsuggested that only a seizure of power by 'the revolutionary \nproletariat together with the revolutionary soldiers' could bring \nabout 'a truly democratic peace' . Bagdatev and several other leaders of the Petrograd City \nOrganisation on 21 April issued a leaflet urging the immediate \noverthrow of the Provisional Government. For the Bolsheviks, the 'April crisis' had profound \nconsequences. Previous Conferences of Bolsheviks were held \nin Finland or in the emigration. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. \nOne hundred and fifty-two delegates attended, from nearly all \nmajor organisations associated with the Bolsheviks. His esteem among Bolsheviks had reached \nits highest point yet. Bubnov from the \nBolsheviks' Moscow Regional Bureau, who wanted clauses inserted \non the need to 'control' the Provisional Government since it had \nbecome 'counterrevolutionary'. 59 \nLenin sat down; he had shown, as at the Petrograd City \nConference just days before, that he could adjust his public posture \n There Is Such a Party.65 Bolsheviks since 1905 had urged \nthat only mass socialist organisations could ensure the establishment \nof a truly democratic order in Russia, so that Kamenev's call for a \ntransfer of governmental authority was not entirely unexpected. 68 \nKamenev was also cheered by Lenin's discomfiture at the \ninsurrectionary appeal made on 21 April by Bolshevik activists in \nPetrograd: Lenin was forced to disown and criticise it (even though \nhis own Central Committee resolution had helped to contribute to its \ncomposition). Kamenev almost \ntheatrically welcomed the Central Committee's ban on insurrection-\n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nary slogans. Perhaps he \nfound Bubnov's formulation to be too reminiscent of Trotski (who as \nyet remained a figure of suspicion among Bolsheviks). On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F. \nThis provoked Lenin to remark that Petrograd and Moscow were \nnow lagging behind the provinces in revolutionary achievement. The crux of his remarks was that \nthe Bolsheviks, on coming to power, should 'openly propose a \n There Is Such a Party.80 Be that as it may, \nLenin's motion was passed nem. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. At least two \nother Bolshevik leaders, Iosif Stalin and M. 89 \nThis drastic reversal of the defeats sustained at the hands of his \nown Bolsheviks in 1905-7 was accomplished with little discussion. So was \nLenin's on the need to start work on the writing of a new party \nprogramme. particularly those who were only visiting \nPetrograd, wanted to know more about events in the capital. Fedorov, member of the \nPetersburg City Committee (which refused to change its name to the \nPetrograd Committee as a protest against the government's 'chau-\nvinism' in renaming the capital), reported on the progress of the \nPetrograd Soviet debate on the acceptability of a government \ncoalition of liberals and socialists. The proceedings continued with Zinoviev's report \non the need for the Bolsheviks to unite with all social-democrats \nregarded by them as truly internationalist in orientation. \n175 \nInterdistricters were close in strategy to Trotski; and Zinoviev, \ndeliberately or not, was initiating a process which culminated in \nTrotski's entry to the Bolshevik party in July.95 Stalin's final speech dwelt on the \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nusefulness of the national liberation movement as a 'bridge' between \nEast and West. 102 Lenin, however, could feel \nsatisfied. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. \nAGAINST DUAL POWER \nThe Bolshevik All-Russian Conference's resolution forbidding social-\nists to enter the Provisional Government was passed in a week when \nLvov was negotiating for Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries to \njoin his cabinet. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. 105 In Petrograd, the \nVyborg District Soviet was solidly hostile to the cabinet after the \nFebruary Revolution. But the lower the level, the stronger the representation of the \nBolsheviks. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' .106 \nBolsheviks concluded that it was only a matter of time and \npolitical effort, before the Petrograd Soviet fell to them, and those \namong them who still hankered after a united Russian Social-\n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDemocratic Labour Party with the Mensheviks diminished. The \nliaison between the Kadet party and the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries strengthened Bolshevik intransigence. This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. For Lenin, it \nwas the heyday of his public appearances. He spoke at the First All-\nRussian Congress of Peasants' Deputies and the First Petrograd City \nConference of Factory-Workshop Committees in May, and at the \nFirst All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies in June. 110 \nBolshevik Central Committee policies were modified for popular \nconsumption. The Central Commit-\ntee simplified the April Party Conference's resolutions, which were \nphrased in terms impervious to most non-Marxists, and indeed many \nBolsheviks. The incentive came with the need to set out a list of the \nparty's demands and slogans for the forthcoming election of deputies \nto the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin sketched a draft calling for 'no \nsupport' for the Provisional Government and for an end to the war \nwithout annexations and indemnities and with full self-determination \nfor all peoples. These topics continued \nto be addressed among Bolshevik leaders through 1917; but there was \na recognition that such talk would not gain universal approval on the \nstreets. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. The scheme for an armed march of protest against \nthe Provisional Government, coinciding with the convocation of the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, was \ninstigated by members of the Bolshevik Military Organisation. Thus their radical-\nism overspilled the bounds respected by Lenin himself since the All-\nRussian April Conference of the Bolshevik party. \n181 \nThis was the nearest any Bolshevik had come since the February \nRevolution to stating how the Provisional Government might be \noverthrown. The Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries held their expected majority; only lOS out \nof 777 were Bolsheviks. It was the high point of the anti-\nBolshevik socialist movement in Russia; and the alliance of Men-\nsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries easily dominated the Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets which was elected to \nassume the functions of national soviet leadership. \nOn the second day, 4 June, Lenin was given the chance to reply on \nbehalf of the Bolsheviks. But it was \napparent that the Bolsheviks lacked the support in the country for \nany attempt at the formation of a government. The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. Not even many Bolshevik \ndelegates to the Congress knewY0 A joint meeting of the Central \nCommittee, Military Organisation and the Petersburg Committee's \nExecutive Commission took place on 6 June while the Congress was \nin session; and, behind closed doors, the case for a demonstration \nwas offered by Military Organisation leader N. A clash between Lenin and \nNogin ensued; and Nogin vehemently expostulated: 'Lenin is \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposing a revolution. It would indeed seem that Lenin was aspiring not to the \ninstallation of a Bolshevik government but rather a transfer of power \nto the soviets, which would have resulted in a government of \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. The Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships were worried by the posters \npinned up around Petrograd by Bolshevik activists. The scene was set for the first \ntest of strength between the Bolsheviks and the Provisional Govern-\nment.127 \nLenin panicked. The banning of a demonstration by the Petrograd \nSoviet had not entered his calculations. Five members were able to attend despite the short \nnotice: Kamenev, Lenin, Nogin, Sverdlov and Zinoviev. \nOutvoted, Lenin and Sverdlov abstained. His \nvehemence, moreover, was opposed even by several non-Bolsheviks. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. 131 The result, on 12 June, was that \nthe Bolsheviks were merely censured for recklessness. The Bolsheviks \nparticipated in the demonstration with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries even though there were frictions over the \nBolshevik party's insistence on marching under its own slogans, \nincluding 'All Power To The Soviets'. \nThe displeasure was intense since it was the Petersburg Committee's \nactivists and not Lenin who had the uncongenial task of dissuading \nagitated crowds of anti-governmental workers, soldiers and sailors \n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom undertaking a demonstration which the Central Committee had \nencouraged. Most onlookers found the similarities rather \nthan the differences between the Kadets and the non-Bolshevik \nsocialists most impressive. 137 The net effect of \nthe vilification, at least until early July, was to disseminate the \nproposals of the Bolsheviks more widely. 138 \nLenin and his associates, however, were perturbed by the smear \ncampaign. The party in the provinces expressed its concern, and \nrequests were made to the Central Committee to counter the anti-\nBolshevik tirades by publishing information on the real Lenin, his \nbackground and personality. Lenin began a sketch of his life. 142 Bolsheviks were evidently not \nintending to establish a 'cult' around him. They recognised Lenin \nas their party chief with fewer reservations than the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had about Viktor Chernov or even the Kadets \nabout Pavel Milyukov; 143 but they held back from adulation. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHe proved adept too at mass oratory. \nBesides Central Committee sessions and local party occasions in \nPetrograd, Lenin had to address eleven large gatherings. These \nincluded not only formal speeches to the Petrograd Conference of \nFactory-Workshop Committees, the All Russian Congress of Pea-\nsants' Deputies and the All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' \nand Soldiers' Deputies but also five open-air speeches at the gates of \nPetrograd factories. Petrograd was a base from where he ventured only \nrarely. He knew about the provincial political \nprocesses only from newspapers and from Bolshevik activists coming \nto Petrograd for meetings, conferences and congresses \nThis also meant that direct knowledge of Lenin the man was \nthinly-spread in the rest of the country. This was not, at least not yet, the Bolshevik \nparty's style. Bolsheviks printed most pictures of their leaders later in \nthe year, after they had seized power. The year \n1917 was the golden age of Russian print journalism, and Lenin \ndevoted more hours per day to writing for Pravda- he wrote little for \nother Bolshevik outlets- than to any other political function. Only the villages, which had hardly any Bolshevik party \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngroups, were left outside the normal distribution network. Thus \nLenin's opinions were communicated directly to a vastly greater \nnumber of people outside Petrograd than the few hundred provincial \nactivists who heard him speak. Even so, it must be added that nearly \nhalf the copies were sold in Petro grad and that therefore not even all \nliterate Bolshevik rank-and-filers can have read the words of their \nparty leader). 157 \nLenin was Pravda's regular columnist on current political issues; \nand in this role he especially aimed to acquire the support of \nBolshevik committee-men in Petrograd and the localities for his \nstrategy. \nAnd Lenin, like his Central Committee colleagues, carried a heavy \nload of responsibilities on the Bolshevik party's behalf. Lenin and Krupskaya were relieved of the \nbusiness of correspondence with local party committees. Moreover, it was Kamenev's \nmain job to direct the Bolshevik fraction in the Petrograd Soviet \n(whereas Lenin, the great advocate of 'all power to the soviets' in the \n There Is Such a Party. \n189 \nspring, was not elected to the Soviet). Zinoviev, too, was emerging as a figure of substance \non the Bolshevik right. A similar mixture of rancour and \npolitical calculation held back leading anti-Lenin Bolsheviks from \nthe pre-war period, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov. They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. He reached Petrograd from the emigration \nonly in May 1917. Even before the February Revolution, as Lenin \nand Zinoviev noted, he had denounced Chkheidze and the Men-\nshevik Duma deputies; 168 and, upon his return to Russia, he agreed \nwith the Bolsheviks that a rupture was desirable with the Menshevik \nleaders who condoned the coalition with the Kadets. The development of Lenin as a chairman of \nBolshevik opinion and as a leader who could coax unlikely partners \nto co-operate had begun. This was the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee (or VTsiK), and its leading members were Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries as well as some Bundists. All were members of the Petrograd \nSoviet, whose importance declined at the national level. 177 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Petersburg Committee was also in session on 20 June. And yet it was precisely \nnow, on 29 June, that Lenin felt able to take a rest for a few days in \nNeivola, a village in the Finnish countryside some four or five hours \ndistant from Petrograd by local train. 181 In midsummer 1917 the political stakes were much \nhigher, and yet Lenin unconcernedly departed to stay in Vladimir \nBonch-Bruevich's rural dacha. Low-level Bolshevik activists were involved. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. 185 Bolsheviks in the \nparty's lower echelons did little to restrain the crowds; some of them \nactively fomented trouble. When the news reached the Petrograd \nBolshevik City Conference, the delegates ignored the Central \nCommittee's prohibition and offered to lead the demonstration 'if \nthis proved necessary'. \nBut they would not budge, to the delight of a Bolshevik All-Russian \nBureau of Military Organisations which announced its readiness to \nguide the demonstration. But the \nBolshevik leadership, in the Petersburg Committee and in the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisations, were following rather \nthan guiding events; and, although most participants hoped that the \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nturmoil would somehow result in the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment, they had no definite set of tactics. The crowds swelled around the \nTauride Palace where the Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional \nGovernment were based. The worry \npersisted that the outcome would not be happy, and the Bolshevik \ncentral leaders wanted to take as few obviously incriminating steps as \npossible. They made for the \nKshesinskaya palace to seek out the Bolshevik leaders. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. The \nBolshevik Central Committee called on the crowds to leave the \nstreets. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. \nLenin declared that the revolutionary process was entering a critical \nphase. The Bolshevik \nparty needed to make tactical adjustments to survive and flourish \nagain.204 \nESCAPE TO THE LAKES \nAnti-Bolshevik repression had ensued in Petrograd. The deaths of \ndemonstrators ran into the hundreds, and there were many reports of \nviolence being meted out to known or suspected Bolsheviks \nencountered on the streets. \nTrotski and Lunacharski, despite not belonging to the Bolshevik \nparty, had been involved in negotiations about the demonstration; \nthey too were sought by troops loyal to the Provisional Govern-\nment. The exceptions were Lenin and Zinoviev. They had consistently \nrepudiated the accusation, taking space in Bolshevik newspapers to \nexplain their story and to stress that they would have returned via \nFrance and the North Sea if only the Allied authorities had given \npermission. \n197 \nBurtsev had spent a career exposing police agents in the Russian \nrevolutionary movement; Aleksinski was a former Bolshevik whose \nhostility to Lenin had induced him to found a newspaper, Without \nSuperfluous Words, dedicated wholly to the exposure of Bolshevik \nmisdeeds. 207 \nEven so, Lenin and Zinoviev initially thought to deliver themselves \nup to the authorities on condition that the Petrograd Soviet would \nguarantee physical protection and a fair trial. 208 Several Bolsheviks \nadvised this. The additional consideration was that all revolutionary parties, \nincluding the Bolsheviks, assumed that no single leader's fate should \nbe put before the good of the party and the Revolution. \nManuilski, who had contacts with factory workers in Petrograd. \nGruesome cartoons depicted Lenin on a scaffold.212 But Bolshevik \ncalls for him to surrender himself to the authorities subsided, and \nLenin and Zinoviev went into hiding in the capital.213 The next \ntwenty-four hours convinced them that Petrograd was too dangerous \nfor them.214 For \nthe next month they stayed with the Bolshevik and factory worker \nNikolai Emelyanov, who had, like many Russian workers, retained a \nhouse and some land in the countryside. Lenin and Zinoviev slept in \nthe barn-loft. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe two men felt able to stroll around so long as they took \nreasonable care, but scares sometimes happened. On one occasion \nthe sight of approaching armed men caused Lenin and Zinoviev to \ndive into a haystack. The Provisional Government's repressive zeal was fading \nsomewhat, and Lenin and Zinoviev received secret visits from \nBolshevik Central Committee members. Politics \nin Petrograd remained unstable. A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN. The question of law and order in \nPetrograd and other cities lay under the surface; and frequent \ndiscussions were held between the new premier and General Lavr \nKornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of Russian armed forces, in \npursuit of a solution.221 \nLenin desired to put greater distance between Petrograd and \nhimself.

The Bolsheviks were feared for their \ndiscipline and hierarchy; and yet their party was, by the standards \nof its own rulebook, highly ill-disciplined.tensions affected relations at all \nlevels of the Bolshevik party's formal hierarchy. Thus the Bolsheviks \nwere not so unlike the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as \nlater mythology contended; 1 and the fact that the Bolshevik party \nwas ill co-ordinated allowed its local activists to react dynamically to \nthe particularity of local events. The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. Being \ninnocent of the co-responsibility for the Provisional Government \nwhich affected their rivals, Bolsheviks could organise their political \ncampaign unfettered. In these conditions it was natural for dissentient \nleftists at lower levels to leave and join the Bolsheviks.", "Bolshevik_Intentions_1917": " 5 Unsealed Messages: 1916 \nto April 1917 \nTHE RUSSIAN EMPIRE ON THE BRINK \nPopular uprisings are often described in volcanic imagery: the \nstorming of the Bastille in 1789 grips the imagination two centuries \nlater; the anti-Soviet revolt in Hungary in 1956 comes to us in \npictures of uncontrolled mass fury on Budapest streets.

Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were \noperating in the suburbs. It is a remarkable \nfact that in 1915-16, except for commentary on disputes among \nsocialists in Petrograd, he wrote only one article specifically about \ngeneral politics in the Russian empire - and a short article at that;3 \nand he overlooked the provinces altogether.9 \nLenin's absorption in mid-European affair:: was not wholly \nvoluntary.

The \nnewcomers were not Bolsheviks but a pair of ordinary conscripts \nwho had escaped from German captivity. 12 \nSo Russian political emigrants in Switzerland had greater excuse \nthan most in failing to perceive in early 1917 that the ultimate crisis \nfor the Romanov monarchy was maturing fast. No \nRussian Marxist except Petr Maslov was better-noted for his \nattention to rural affairs. Strikes swept over Russia in the winter of \n1915-16 and again in late 1916. The huge industrial expansion \n(and Lenin, when in 1917 he was to take a closer interest in wartime \neconomic processes, was virtually alone in emphasising that an \nexpansion of output in factories and mines had occurred) 16 was \naccompanied by problems.5 million workers by January 1917. \n 132 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe moderate conservatives and liberals in the Fourth State Duma \nsaw the need to contact the working class through war-industry \ncommittees which were constituted by both industrialists and work-\ners. In the winter of 1916-1917 the equally \nexasperated Octobrist leader Guchkov took discreet soundings \namong the generals about their attitude to a potential coup against \nthe emperor. The war-industry \ncommittees, despite being shunned by Bolsheviks on the grounds that \nthey were merely a means for prosecuting an imperialist war more \nsuccessfully, allowed the Mensheviks to organise covert anti-regime \npropaganda. Bolsheviks no longer had seats in the Duma; all their \ndeputies languished in Siberian exile. \nTHE KIENTHAL CONFERENCE \nLenin's considerations on Russia at war skirted developments on the \nEastern front. 21 But \nLenin's day-to-day preoccupation was not so much with general \npolitics and social life as with the factional strife among Europe's \nsocialists after the Zimmerwald Conference of September 1915. Zinoviev, the Bolshevik \nrepresentative on the International Socialist Commission established \nat Zimmerwald, constantly expressed reservations about Grimm's \ncentrist motivations. This was yet another reason why Lenin detested \nKautsky. The \nmandate of Martov and Akselrod to represent any Russian group \nwas, as usual, challenged by the Bolsheviks. Lenin passed a note back to him stating yet again that only \npolitical revolution would suffice to terminate the war. Martov \ndeclared that, if there was a problem in inter-socialist relations, then \nthe Bolsheviks had helped to cause it. \n Unsealed Messages \n139 \n'MARXISM ON THE STATE' \nLenin was a serious thinker; but he was also in serious need of \nsustaining his confidence.55 \nUntil January 1917, Lenin did not ponder exactly how the \ninception of socialism, wherever it took place, would be under-\ntaken; the future dictatorship of the proletariat lay undefined. Largely neglecting Clausewitz's discussion of the \nvariegated aspects of warfare, Lenin underscored the sections \nderiding the pretensions of generals.57 For the Bolshevik leader, it \nwas Clausewitz's description of the organisational simplifications \nbrought about by modern technology that were impressive (as well as \nhis sangfroid about war and death). 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. Profits still \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \naccrued to large private enterprises in particular.61 But the extension \nof planning inside the German and British economies was an \nirrefutable reality, and Lenin contended that the Russian economy \ntoo had the same features to an increasing degree. \nLenin, furthermore, began to show an edginess in his rejection of \nBukharin's claim that a future socialist government would have to \ndestroy the old capitalist state and construct its own state from \nscratch. In January and February 1917 Lenin took his own notes \non Marxism and the state.65 Lenin \ndesired the textual security of support from Marxism's co-founders. 'Apparently not', was Lenin's \nconclusion until his further research convinced him otherwise. 76 Lenin called for an innovation of cardinal \nstrategical significance: that the dictatorship of the proletariat should \nbe constructed on the institutional basis of the soviets. In January \nand February 1917 he went further: the workers' soviets were not \nmerely to bring down the Russian monarchy and establish a \ndemocratic political framework for capitalism, they were also to \ninitiate the entire transition to socialism. 78 \nAs to the functions of such soviets, he was less concerned to \ninvestigate how they had actually operated in 1905 than to indicate \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhow they might operate in the future. Sounding a note that was novel for him, Lenin declared the \ndesirability of the 'fullest local self-administration'.'80 \nIt occurred to Lenin that such a system, being based upon social \nself-regulation, was hardly describable any longer as a 'state'. 82 Thus Lenin's notebooks, \nwhich he headed 'Marxism on the State', offered not only the most \ndetailed but also one of the most elevated statements by a twentieth-\ncentury Marxist on the transition from capitalism; they undermine all \nthose interpretations of him as a desolate, worried individual in \n1916-17. Only the news of events back in Russia in February 1917 \ninterrupted the writing up of his materials. The combination of direct intention, naive expecta-\ntion and failure to think issues through boded ill for the chances of \nrealising the freedoms that, in the first two months of 1917, he \nprofessed to desire. \nTHE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION \nAbruptly, from the beginning of March 1917, Lenin was forced to \ntake greater account of developments in current politics in Russia. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. Activists in Petrograd improvised as best they could, \nand calls for the re-establishment of soviets were already being heard. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. Lenin's contemptuous \ndismissal of Russian liberalism as the fifth wheel on the carriage of \ntsarism was harsh but, at such a time of crisis, not wide of the mark. \n Unsealed Messages \n145 \nThe emigre revolutionaries perforce relied mainly on non-Russian \nsources of information. The Bolshevik \nleader's continuing preoccupation was with socialist polemics in \nEurope, and he noted trenchantly: 'There is nothing coming from \nRussia, not even letters.89 \nThe Russian emigration was ecstatic. There were celebratory \nembraces and evening-parties, congratulatory messages to the \nnewspapers; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nproclaimed that a millstone had been removed from the shoulders of \nthe people of Russia and her subject territories. Lenin shared in the \ncheer without Jetting himself be carried away.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government. He called for 'international proletarian \nrevolution', but offered no prescription as to what should be done in \nRussia.95 This constituted a \nrupture with the old Bolshevik programme. Bolsheviks in 1905 called \nfor a coalition of socialist parties representing all the workers and all \nthe peasants. \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'A workers' government' had figured prominently as an objective \nin Trotski's writings, which Lenin had previously rejected. But it has lain \nunobserved that Lenin's phraseology about the poorest peasants was \nlike that of Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg.97 At any rate, he had severely \ndistorted the conventional Russian Marxist two-stage revolutionary \nschedule. In a telegram to Bolsheviks leaving Scandi-\nnavia for Russia, also on 4 March, he restricted his recommenda-\ntions: no support for the Provisional Government; suspicion of \nKerenski; the arming of the proletariat; elections to the Petrograd \nmunicipal council; and no rapprochement with other parties. 103 Bolsheviks in Petrograd \nat the time of the February Revolution independently felt a similar \ndistaste. The Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, meeting on \n28 February under Shlyapnikov's guidance, called for the formation \nof a provisional revolutionary government of socialists, in line with \ntraditional Bolshevism. But the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary \nacceptance of the Provisional Government prevented the Bureau's \naims from being realised; and the Bolshevik City Committee, too, \nopposed the Bureau. 105 Shlyapnikov and his associates, being forced \nto reconsider tactics, edged towards advocating a role for the soviets \nas 'embryos of the new power'. 106 Allies for Lenin were coming into \nexistence without either the allies or Lenin being conscious of such an \nalliance. Disputes \nbetween Pravda and the Russian Bureau persisted through March \n1917. 109 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin rued the absence of rapid communication between Petrograd \nand Switzerland. 111 But his most \nsignificant request was for the Bolsheviks to move from 'the first \nto the second stage of the revolution'. 114 The third \n'Letter from Afar', composed on 11 March, showed signs of \nawareness of the transformation wrought by such ideas in the \ngenerally accepted concept of Bolshevik strategy. 115 The next day, in the fourth 'Letter', \nLenin stopped talking of the militia and said instead that 'an All-\nRussian Soviet (or a Petersburg Soviet temporarily acting as its \nsubstitute)' should take power. 116 But if the future socialist state was \nnot the dictatorship of the proletariat but a peculiar Russian hybrid \nform, what were the measures to be enacted. But Lenin's self-restraint did not \nsignify a lack of confidence. Lenin's perennial adversary, A. \nMartynov, deriding his recommendations as 'utopian' and 'over-\nsimplified', urged trenchantly: 'Don't get in a hurry, comrade Lenin. He declared Lenin's ideas to be 'Blanquist', exhibiting an \nunbridled frustration with objective political circumstances and a will \nto deploy violence to attain socialist ends. There was wide agreement that Lenin had \nproduced a woefully 'confused idea'. 123 The construction of the \nanti-Lenin Marxist case in 1917 had begun. Plekhanov, sailing to \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSweden, took a train through to Petrograd in the company of British \nsocialist Will O'Grady and was feted in a hero's welcome in \nPetrograd. He cursed his decision to sit out the war in Switzerland \nand not to join other Bolsheviks in Scandinavia. Lenin fantasised about crossing Germany unrecognised by \ndonning a wig and using V. \nKrupskaya, more amused than horrified, dissuaded Lenin by \npointing out that he would give himself away by muttering \ncomplaints in his sleep about Mensheviks. 131 \nMartov cooked up the most practical idea: an exchange of the \nRussian political emigrants in Switzerland for German citizens \ninterned in Russia. Russian Foreign Mini-\nster Pavel Milyukov did not yearn to greet politicians struggling \nagainst his government's policies and even, in Lenin's case, working \nfor its overthrow. Still no satisfaction from Russia. 133 \nLenin, never having expected much good from Milyukov and \nsuspecting that Grimm lacked singlemindedness as a negotiator, \ngrabbed the initiative. Lenin sent \ninvitations to fellow socialists to join him. \nMartov spurned Lenin's invitation and waited for the Provisional \nGovernment's sanction, condemning himself to starting out weeks \nafter Lenin 138 Several Bundists and the Polish social-democrat Karl \nRadek, however, did consent. The final number of passengers was \nthirty-two, and twenty of them were Bolsheviks139 Krupskaya talked \nof coming later so that she could wind up factional and personal \nbusiness; but Lenin would not hear of this. They packed three large \nsuitcases and a primus stove to cook for themselves on the train and \nthe two of them bustled about so much in the last days 140 that Lenin \nhad no time to finish the fifth and last of his 'Letters from Afar'. Lenin was mindful of the European political perspec-\ntive and read out a 'Farewell Letter to Swiss Workers'. He claimed that, \n 152 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndespite having been mocked for his slogan of 'turning the imperialist \nwar into a civil war' in 1914, the February Revolution's occurrence \nmeant that 'only the blind cannot see that this slogan is correct'. d 42 With a \nbluntness absent from his 'Letters from Afar', which were intended \nfor Russian Bolshevik readers, he declared: 'Russia is a peasant \ncountry. \nLenin's mind after the reading out of his 'Farewell Letter' was fixed \non the journey to Russia. \nafter walking through a crowd of malevolently raucous fellow \nRussian emigres. \nA certain Oscar Blum, who was a social-democrat suspected by Lenin \nof being a Russian spy, surreptitiously joined the party on the train. Lenin edged back towards a wall and the other Bolshevik \nmen stood protectively in front of their leader. Lenin protested at the discrimina-\n Unsealed Messages \n153 \ntion; but it was explained to him that the arrangement would allow \nhim to work more conveniently. Lenin went on filling his notebooks. Janson sought a \nmeeting with Lenin. The request was turned down by Lenin, who \nthreatened to beat him up if he came on board. 149 Tiffs among the \nRussians persisted. 151 This was a joke whose acidity was to \nlose its bite later in the year; at the time it played upon the \nuncertainties of a trainload of Russian Marxists approaching their \ndestination without guarantee that arrest did not await them in \nPetrograd. Lenin received an invitation from Alexander Parvus-\n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHelphand, a member of the German Social-Democratic Party who \ncarried out missions for the German government with funds to \ndisburse to Russian revolutionaries whose activity might destabilise \nthe Russian government, to meet for discussions. Lenin declined. \nNothing incriminating was found, and Lenin telegraphed a message \nto his sisters that he would arrive in Petrograd on 3 April. 156 It was \nat Tornio, too, that he obtained copies of the new central Bolshevik \nnewspaper Pravda; 157 and, in the dimly-lit customs hall, he found \nhimself a quiet corner to read them while Zinoviev busied himself \nwith practical arrangements for the journey. Flicking through the pages, Lenin \nsuddenly turned pale: 'Malinovski,' he shouted over to Zinoviev, 'has \nturned out to be a provocateur. Central \nCommittee member Kamenev and other Bolsheviks had journeyed \nout to meet them. Lenin curtailed the exchange of pleasantries, \nblurting out to Kamenev: 'What have you been writing in Pravda. Each party or faction tried to outdo the rest in turning \nout a large gathering of supporters; but the co-operation among the \ncapital's socialists in March 1917 meant that most receptions became \nan opportunity for general festivities. Lenin, with a deliberate snub, \nmade no reply but announced the need for 'worldwide socialist \nrevolution'. His tirade \nagainst the capitalist order in Russia and abroad was fiercer than \nminutes earlier. The challenge to the Provisional Government and to \nits conditional supporters among the ranks of socialism, including \nmany Bolsheviks, was posed on the streets of the capital. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. The kindest interpretation, never offered by Lenin, is that \nThe April Theses were essentially a reproduction of the notebooks on \n'Marxism on the State'. 163 Lenin had begun, in the winter of 1916-\n17, to perceive Russia as being characterised by aspects of 'state \ncapitalism'; 164 but these were preliminary musings. In fact the \nolder Bolshevik strategy had never been a clear two-stage revolu-\ntionary strategy. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 166 \nMoreover, the First World War and its political repercussions \ndominated Lenin's life after 1914, leading him to reject all persons \nand notions which appeared to him to fail to oppose imperialism in a \n Unsealed Messages \n157 \nfundamental fashion. 167 And Lenin in 1917 obviously sensed the \nexistence of a crack in the dam, giving him an opportunity to unleash \nthe flooding waters of history. For example, the fourth thesis \nconceded that 'revolutionary defencism' was sincerely advocated by \na vast number of elected popular representatives in the soviets, and \nthat the Bolsheviks constituted merely a 'pale minority'. 171 Lenin \nalso admitted: 'Russia at the moment is the freest country in the \nworld of all the belligerent countries.' The Bolsheviks should \nconcentrate upon using the new political liberties. 172 Lenin's \nfinessing probably resulted from conversations in Sweden with \nBolsheviks in closer contact with Russian conditions than the \ncorrespondent of Zurcher Post, or from his exchanges with Kame-\nnev at the Finnish frontier. \nAt any rate, Lenin contended flatly that the workers' soviets were \n'the sole possible form of revolutionary government.175 In economic policy Lenin had a couple of proposals. In \nThesis Six, he advocated land nationalisation (which he had failed to \nhave officially accepted by Bolsheviks in the past). 177 This, \naccording to Lenin's eighth thesis, signified not a scheme for instant \nsocialism but 'a transition immediately only to the control by the \nworkers' soviets over social production and the distribution of \nproducts'. But a thumping brevity was typical, and the tenth thesis was \nrapped out in twelve Russian words: 'Renovation of the Interna-\ntional.' 179 Snappy, \ntruculent phrases abounded, often without being incorporated in \nfull sentences; and ideas were reiterated, despite Lenin's self-imposed \nconfines of space, to drive home the message. Despite the inelegance and the hurried composition, the \nrhetorical subtleties of Lenin's writing were arresting. 183 (Now there's a typical \nadverbial triptych for connoisseurs of Lenin's prose.184 (It may be thought that the phrasing betrays a \n Unsealed Messages \n159 \ncertain intellectualist condescension; but Lenin wrote The April \nTheses mainly for the party's leaders, central and local, who used \nsuch terminology regardless as to whether they were of middle-class \nor working-class background. 185 This was scarcely a \nplan of detailed guidance for Bolshevik organisers, but at least it \nadvised what was not to be done. Lenin knew that the April Theses \nwere merely a preliminary sketch. Nothing about central \nplanning, except for a very general plea for soviet control 'over \nsocial production and exchange of products'. Equally striking \nwas Lenin's silence on the economic and social rights and duties of \nworkers, peasants and soldiers. \nLenin's technique was to deliver assertions and demands, not \nexplanatory analysis. Kamenev, his main rival in Bolshevik theory \nin the post-February days, issued only Pravda articles; no straight-\nforward summons to action came from him. The \nrelations among the respective soviets of the workers, peasants, \nfarmworkers and soldiers were left unclear. It was also unclear \nwhether the workers' soviets would have powers superior to the \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsoviets of the other social groups. 188 Furthermore, the rural network \nof soviets was only patchily described; and Lenin, using a variety of \nformulations, gave scant guidance as how to settle relationships \namong the farmworkers, the poorest peasants and the peasantry as a \nwhole. 189 But the skimpiness of theory in The April Theses caused \nLenin himself no embarrassment. The April Theses were the first broad-ranging \nstatement of a fundamental Bolshevik alternative to the policies of \nKamenev and Stalin. Many Bolsheviks agreed on the desirability of \nanother revolution in Russia in the near future; but neither \nShlyapnikov nor any other Bolshevik radical had come forward \nwith quite so broad-ranging a schema. The theses instigated a bitter \ndispute among Bolsheviks, and Lenin had made striking contribution \nto the politics of Bolshevism after the February Revolution. \nApril to July 1917 \nFIGHTING FOR BOLSHEVISM \nThe February Revolution span the kaleidoscope of Russia's politics, \njolting the alliances and rivalries among the parties, and politicians \ngained a freedom of choice unrestricted by the Romanov monarchy. \nLenin's April Theses were the acme of free will. the City Soviet.", "Georgi_And_Valentina_1917": " The February \nRevolution of 1917 in Petrograd is no exception.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government.", "February_Revolution_1917": " 5 Unsealed Messages: 1916 \nto April 1917 \nTHE RUSSIAN EMPIRE ON THE BRINK \nPopular uprisings are often described in volcanic imagery: the \nstorming of the Bastille in 1789 grips the imagination two centuries \nlater; the anti-Soviet revolt in Hungary in 1956 comes to us in \npictures of uncontrolled mass fury on Budapest streets.

The revolutionary activists gathered their \nnerve and began again to organise for the speedy overthrow of the \ngovernment. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. \nBut the revolution was spreading elsewhere. Petrograd dailies arrived only after the \nFebruary Revolution's occurrence.

He claimed that, \n 152 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndespite having been mocked for his slogan of 'turning the imperialist \nwar into a civil war' in 1914, the February Revolution's occurrence \nmeant that 'only the blind cannot see that this slogan is correct'. Each party or faction tried to outdo the rest in turning \nout a large gathering of supporters; but the co-operation among the \ncapital's socialists in March 1917 meant that most receptions became \nan opportunity for general festivities. Lenin, with a deliberate snub, \nmade no reply but announced the need for 'worldwide socialist \nrevolution'. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia.

The February \nRevolution of 1917 in Petrograd is no exception. The terms \nused betray the prejudices of the commentators (and these include \nLenin and other leading Bolsheviks). \nFurthermore, although the party activists were few in Petrograd in \nFebruary 1917, there were enough to give guidance to an uprising \nonce the chance to overthrow the autocracy had become fully \nevident. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries were \noperating in the suburbs. It is a remarkable \nfact that in 1915-16, except for commentary on disputes among \nsocialists in Petrograd, he wrote only one article specifically about \ngeneral politics in the Russian empire - and a short article at that;3 \nand he overlooked the provinces altogether. Lenin jotted down in his notebooks \nthat a German centrist had described Liebknecht as a follower of 'the \nRussian Lenin'. 7 Periodically, the mental strain on him was also \ntremendous and Lenin sometimes refused invitations to speak in \npublic. Lenin contemplated a campaign to persuade Swiss \nsocialists to press for all foreigners with six months' residence in \nSwitzerland to have automatic right to Swiss citizenship.9 \nLenin's absorption in mid-European affair:: was not wholly \nvoluntary. When he obtained copies of these, however, the informa-\n 130 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion was far from being exhaustive. Nor could the Foreign Bureau of \nthe Central Committee obtain data through Bolsheviks arriving in \nSwitzerland from Russia. 12 \nSo Russian political emigrants in Switzerland had greater excuse \nthan most in failing to perceive in early 1917 that the ultimate crisis \nfor the Romanov monarchy was maturing fast. 14 \nFor an economic commentator like Lenin, this worsening situation \nwould normally have called forth pages of analysis; and, as a \nrevolutionary, he would normally have displayed an informed \npleasure. No \nRussian Marxist except Petr Maslov was better-noted for his \nattention to rural affairs. But Lenin ignored, or probably more \naccurately, was unaware of, the peasantry's problems. The huge industrial expansion \n(and Lenin, when in 1917 he was to take a closer interest in wartime \neconomic processes, was virtually alone in emphasising that an \nexpansion of output in factories and mines had occurred) 16 was \naccompanied by problems.5 million workers by January 1917. \n 132 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe moderate conservatives and liberals in the Fourth State Duma \nsaw the need to contact the working class through war-industry \ncommittees which were constituted by both industrialists and work-\ners. The war-industry \ncommittees, despite being shunned by Bolsheviks on the grounds that \nthey were merely a means for prosecuting an imperialist war more \nsuccessfully, allowed the Mensheviks to organise covert anti-regime \npropaganda. \nTHE KIENTHAL CONFERENCE \nLenin's considerations on Russia at war skirted developments on the \nEastern front. 21 But \nLenin's day-to-day preoccupation was not so much with general \npolitics and social life as with the factional strife among Europe's \nsocialists after the Zimmerwald Conference of September 1915. Lenin had never \ntrusted him: this was Lenin's usual reaction to someone with whom \nhe disagreed and who wielded influence. Zinoviev had to spend a Jot \nof time reassuring Lenin that the Swiss socialist did not seek to \nexclude him from discussions. Lenin, Radek and Zinoviev \nwanted one for its own sake, while Grimm supported the idea only \nbecause the International Socialist Bureau had remained inactive. Liebknecht and Luxemburg, along with Lenin, \ncalled unequivocally for a campaign of opposition to the govern-\nment. This was yet another reason why Lenin detested \nKautsky.29 Worse was to follow for Grimm: \n 136 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe leading French delegate at Kienthal, Pierre Brizon, had voted in \nfavour of war credits. 33 \nAll this, and Lenin had not yet opened his mouth. An ebullient figure, he \nscribbled a quick note to Lenin charging that his ideas were mere \n'theory'. Lenin passed a note back to him stating yet again that only \npolitical revolution would suffice to terminate the war. Still Lenin had hardly \nopened his mouth in the open sessions. Martov \ndeclared that, if there was a problem in inter-socialist relations, then \nthe Bolsheviks had helped to cause it.42 Akselrod spoke scathingly of \n'Lenin and his friends'.44 Lenin retreated into the \nbackground, resuming an angelic silence. As at Zimmerwald, Radek usually had the edge over \nLenin. It had been Lenin's intention to coax the Left into \npromulgating the principle of national self-determination; but \nRadek's influence forced him to back down.49 Lenin could not \nafford to split the Left without risking making the already small \ngroup of far-left socialists still smaller and less authoritative, and \neven ridiculous. \n Unsealed Messages \n139 \n'MARXISM ON THE STATE' \nLenin was a serious thinker; but he was also in serious need of \nsustaining his confidence.55 \nUntil January 1917, Lenin did not ponder exactly how the \ninception of socialism, wherever it took place, would be under-\ntaken; the future dictatorship of the proletariat lay undefined. Largely neglecting Clausewitz's discussion of the \nvariegated aspects of warfare, Lenin underscored the sections \nderiding the pretensions of generals.57 For the Bolshevik leader, it \nwas Clausewitz's description of the organisational simplifications \nbrought about by modern technology that were impressive (as well as \nhis sangfroid about war and death). 58 When he read Engels's military \nworks, Lenin focused on the same theme and was convinced by the \nassertion that 'an army's need for lengthy, specialist training had been \nmade obsolete by modern conditions. 59 Lenin also surveyed the \nchanges in the wartime capitalist economies. Profits still \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \naccrued to large private enterprises in particular. 60 \nUntil 1916, Lenin had baulked at accepting the term 'state \ncapitalism', perhaps because it infringed the premise that capitalism \nby its nature was an anarchic mode of economy.61 But the extension \nof planning inside the German and British economies was an \nirrefutable reality, and Lenin contended that the Russian economy \ntoo had the same features to an increasing degree. Centralisation \nand state control under capitalism had been augmented; and, \naccording to Lenin, what 'the Junkers and petty gentry' were doing \ntoday could be done tomorrow by 'conscious workers'. 63 As Marxists, Lenin and \nBukharin might have been expected to explore the technological \nchanges that, in their view, had made 'the transition to socialism' an \nimminent possibility in advanced industrial countries. \nLenin, furthermore, began to show an edginess in his rejection of \nBukharin's claim that a future socialist government would have to \ndestroy the old capitalist state and construct its own state from \nscratch. Lenin merely urged him to 'allow his views to mature' before \npublishing his ideas:64 not a symptom of comprehensive criticism of \nBukharin. In January and February 1917 Lenin took his own notes \non Marxism and the state.65 Lenin \ndesired the textual security of support from Marxism's co-founders. Lenin searched furiously, and decided that it was in \nThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napo/eon. 'Apparently not', was Lenin's \nconclusion until his further research convinced him otherwise. And Lenin's conclusions \nwere a shock to him: Marx and Engels had indeed recommended a \ndestruction of the old state machine; and, therefore, Kautsky's wish \nto inherit such a machine was thoroughly un-Marxist.69 \nLenin correctly emphasised that Kautsky had put pressure on \nEngels himself to delete sentences from his commentary on Marx in \n1895 which advocated the use of force as a means of bringing about \nthe transition to socialism.70 Marx in the 1870s, as Lenin knew, had \ngranted the possibility of peaceful change. 71 Yet Lenin asserted that \n'bureaucratism' had entered into all public and commercial life since \nthen, including even socialist parties. 74 Lenin, on his side, \nurged the need for proletarian dictatorship. 76 Lenin called for an innovation of cardinal \nstrategical significance: that the dictatorship of the proletariat should \nbe constructed on the institutional basis of the soviets. In January \nand February 1917 he went further: the workers' soviets were not \nmerely to bring down the Russian monarchy and establish a \ndemocratic political framework for capitalism, they were also to \ninitiate the entire transition to socialism. 78 \nAs to the functions of such soviets, he was less concerned to \ninvestigate how they had actually operated in 1905 than to indicate \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhow they might operate in the future. They would be able, according \nto Lenin, to eradicate all material privileges. Sounding a note that was novel for him, Lenin declared the \ndesirability of the 'fullest local self-administration'.'80 \nIt occurred to Lenin that such a system, being based upon social \nself-regulation, was hardly describable any longer as a 'state'. \nNow Lenin readily cited Marx as treating it as merely a 'semi-state'. 82 Thus Lenin's notebooks, \nwhich he headed 'Marxism on the State', offered not only the most \ndetailed but also one of the most elevated statements by a twentieth-\ncentury Marxist on the transition from capitalism; they undermine all \nthose interpretations of him as a desolate, worried individual in \n1916-17. Lenin's notes, moreover, took it for granted that capitalist \nsociety is neatly divided into two contending classes, the proletariat \nand the bourgeoisie. Furthermore, Lenin began from the \npremise that the proletariat would be a monolithic whole. \nTHE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION \nAbruptly, from the beginning of March 1917, Lenin was forced to \ntake greater account of developments in current politics in Russia. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere involved. It was on the same day that \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe revolutionaries, mainly at Menshevik instigation, formed the \nPetrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. Lenin's contemptuous \ndismissal of Russian liberalism as the fifth wheel on the carriage of \ntsarism was harsh but, at such a time of crisis, not wide of the mark. The Petrograd Soviet, \nmoreover, had a Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary majority \nfavouring the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a \n'bourgeois' government drawn from the Duma leadership. The Bolshevik \nleader's continuing preoccupation was with socialist polemics in \nEurope, and he noted trenchantly: 'There is nothing coming from \nRussia, not even letters. There were celebratory \nembraces and evening-parties, congratulatory messages to the \nnewspapers; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nproclaimed that a millstone had been removed from the shoulders of \nthe people of Russia and her subject territories. Lenin shared in the \ncheer without Jetting himself be carried away.) for having \npredicted, on New Year's Day 1917, that Milyukov, Guchkov and \nKerenski might soon be forming a post-Romanov government. He called for 'international proletarian \nrevolution', but offered no prescription as to what should be done in \nRussia.95 This constituted a \nrupture with the old Bolshevik programme. Bolsheviks in 1905 called \nfor a coalition of socialist parties representing all the workers and all \nthe peasants. Lenin now demanded a government representing the \nentire working class but only the most impoverished sections of the \npeasantry. \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'A workers' government' had figured prominently as an objective \nin Trotski's writings, which Lenin had previously rejected. But it has lain \nunobserved that Lenin's phraseology about the poorest peasants was \nlike that of Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg. Lenin seldom \ncollected his eggs from a single nest.97 At any rate, he had severely \ndistorted the conventional Russian Marxist two-stage revolutionary \nschedule. In a telegram to Bolsheviks leaving Scandi-\nnavia for Russia, also on 4 March, he restricted his recommenda-\ntions: no support for the Provisional Government; suspicion of \nKerenski; the arming of the proletariat; elections to the Petrograd \nmunicipal council; and no rapprochement with other parties. The Provisional \nGovernment had to act circumspectly since the Soviet's Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaders had been elected by workers and \nsoldiers who had overthrown the monarchy. A 'bourgeois government' ought to \ncarry through a 'bourgeois revolution'. 102 \nLenin had long before made his mind up about Chkheidze as being \nan inveterate and untrustworthy compromiser, and ruled out \nunification with him and his adherents. 103 Bolsheviks in Petrograd \nat the time of the February Revolution independently felt a similar \ndistaste. The Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, meeting on \n28 February under Shlyapnikov's guidance, called for the formation \nof a provisional revolutionary government of socialists, in line with \ntraditional Bolshevism. But the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary \nacceptance of the Provisional Government prevented the Bureau's \naims from being realised; and the Bolshevik City Committee, too, \nopposed the Bureau. 106 Allies for Lenin were coming into \nexistence without either the allies or Lenin being conscious of such an \nalliance. 109 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin rued the absence of rapid communication between Petrograd \nand Switzerland. 111 But his most \nsignificant request was for the Bolsheviks to move from 'the first \nto the second stage of the revolution'. Did he mean a \nsocialist revolution or didn't he. 114 The third \n'Letter from Afar', composed on 11 March, showed signs of \nawareness of the transformation wrought by such ideas in the \ngenerally accepted concept of Bolshevik strategy. Such a revolu-\ntion, Lenin claimed, would not be decreeing socialism or even \ninaugurating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Instead, in back-\nward Russia, it would establish 'the revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants'; and only \ntime would tell whether the workers would show sufficient 'con-\nsciousness' to carry it through. 115 The next day, in the fourth 'Letter', \nLenin stopped talking of the militia and said instead that 'an All-\nRussian Soviet (or a Petersburg Soviet temporarily acting as its \nsubstitute)' should take power. 116 But if the future socialist state was \nnot the dictatorship of the proletariat but a peculiar Russian hybrid \nform, what were the measures to be enacted. 118 The last four 'Letters' \nremained unpublished until after Lenin's death. But Lenin's self-restraint did not \nsignify a lack of confidence. 121 It is \nconventionally supposed that debate between Lenin and his oppo-\nnents began in Petrograd, after his return to Russia in April. Lenin's perennial adversary, A. \nMartynov, deriding his recommendations as 'utopian' and 'over-\nsimplified', urged trenchantly: 'Don't get in a hurry, comrade Lenin. He declared Lenin's ideas to be 'Blanquist', exhibiting an \nunbridled frustration with objective political circumstances and a will \nto deploy violence to attain socialist ends. Semovski, another old \nfoe since their entanglement over the national question before the \nwar, stated that the scheme for a workers-and-peasants dictatorship \nappeared to intimate a coalition of Kerenski and Lenin. There was wide agreement that Lenin had \nproduced a woefully 'confused idea'. 123 The construction of the \nanti-Lenin Marxist case in 1917 had begun. The obvious first \noption, which was taken seriously by Lenin and all the Swiss \nemigration, was to take a North Sea steamer. Plekhanov, sailing to \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSweden, took a train through to Petrograd in the company of British \nsocialist Will O'Grady and was feted in a hero's welcome in \nPetrograd. Lenin, who had a declared \npreference for Germany to defeat Russia, was still Jess likely to be \nsuccessful. Lenin fantasised about crossing Germany unrecognised by \ndonning a wig and using V. \nKrupskaya, more amused than horrified, dissuaded Lenin by \npointing out that he would give himself away by muttering \ncomplaints in his sleep about Mensheviks. 130 Lenin even considered \nchartering an aeroplane to fly him across the Eastern front; but the \nimpracticality of the enterprise, in the era before planes had fuel \ntanks to last them hundreds of miles, put him off. 132 Lenin \nlatched on to the plan, and Zinoviev attended an International \nSocialist Commission meeting on 6 March to discuss its handling. Russian Foreign Mini-\nster Pavel Milyukov did not yearn to greet politicians struggling \nagainst his government's policies and even, in Lenin's case, working \nfor its overthrow. 133 \nLenin, never having expected much good from Milyukov and \nsuspecting that Grimm lacked singlemindedness as a negotiator, \ngrabbed the initiative. Lenin sent \ninvitations to fellow socialists to join him.' 137 Risk was \ninherent in the situation, and Lenin was ready to take his chances. \nMartov spurned Lenin's invitation and waited for the Provisional \nGovernment's sanction, condemning himself to starting out weeks \nafter Lenin 138 Several Bundists and the Polish social-democrat Karl \nRadek, however, did consent. The final number of passengers was \nthirty-two, and twenty of them were Bolsheviks139 Krupskaya talked \nof coming later so that she could wind up factional and personal \nbusiness; but Lenin would not hear of this. They packed three large \nsuitcases and a primus stove to cook for themselves on the train and \nthe two of them bustled about so much in the last days 140 that Lenin \nhad no time to finish the fifth and last of his 'Letters from Afar'. Lenin was mindful of the European political perspec-\ntive and read out a 'Farewell Letter to Swiss Workers'. He claimed that, \n 152 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndespite having been mocked for his slogan of 'turning the imperialist \nwar into a civil war' in 1914, the February Revolution's occurrence \nmeant that 'only the blind cannot see that this slogan is correct'.' 143 \nThe difference between the 'Letters from Afar' and the 'Farewell \nLetter' is of slant and style rather than content; for the fifth 'Letter \nfrom Afar' had stated that Lenin's measures constituted only 'a \ntransition to socialism' and did not embody socialism. and \nthe contrast says much about his perceptions about how to \nencourage Russian and Swiss socialists respectively (as well as about \nour need to calibrate our assessment of Lenin's opinions to the \nspecific political context woven around them). \nLenin's mind after the reading out of his 'Farewell Letter' was fixed \non the journey to Russia. \nA certain Oscar Blum, who was a social-democrat suspected by Lenin \nof being a Russian spy, surreptitiously joined the party on the train. \nLenin put his regular physical exercises to use and hauled him bodily \nout of the carriage. Lenin edged back towards a wall and the other Bolshevik \nmen stood protectively in front of their leader. Despite the \nlimitation on space, Lenin and Krupskaya were given a compartment \nto themselves by their comrades. Lenin protested at the discrimina-\n Unsealed Messages \n153 \ntion; but it was explained to him that the arrangement would allow \nhim to work more conveniently. Lenin went on filling his notebooks. Her companions, however, stood up for her; and \nLenin released her to their continuing carousing. Janson sought a \nmeeting with Lenin. The request was turned down by Lenin, who \nthreatened to beat him up if he came on board. Lenin stipulated that all smoking should be \nconfined to the lavatory. 150 Radek poked fun at Lenin, declaring that his imperious \ndispositions in the carriage fitted him to 'assume the leadership of the \nrevolutionary government'. Lenin received an invitation from Alexander Parvus-\n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHelphand, a member of the German Social-Democratic Party who \ncarried out missions for the German government with funds to \ndisburse to Russian revolutionaries whose activity might destabilise \nthe Russian government, to meet for discussions. Lenin declined. Beyond that, however, Lenin would not budge, \nexpostulating that he was not going back to Russia in order to set up \nan off-the-peg clothes stall. \nNothing incriminating was found, and Lenin telegraphed a message \nto his sisters that he would arrive in Petrograd on 3 April. Flicking through the pages, Lenin \nsuddenly turned pale: 'Malinovski,' he shouted over to Zinoviev, 'has \nturned out to be a provocateur. Central \nCommittee member Kamenev and other Bolsheviks had journeyed \nout to meet them. Lenin curtailed the exchange of pleasantries, \nblurting out to Kamenev: 'What have you been writing in Pravda. The popular \nacclaim of a mass of ordinary people (who as yet, let us remember, \nknew next to nothing about Lenin except that he had suffered at the \nhands of the Romanovs and had refused to give up the revolutionary \nstruggle) had not happened to him before. A month after the \nmonarchy's collapse, he was being treated as a major figure in \nRussia's legal politics, but Lenin did not let the occasion go to his \nhead. Lenin, with a deliberate snub, \nmade no reply but announced the need for 'worldwide socialist \nrevolution'. His tirade \nagainst the capitalist order in Russia and abroad was fiercer than \nminutes earlier. The challenge to the Provisional Government and to \nits conditional supporters among the ranks of socialism, including \nmany Bolsheviks, was posed on the streets of the capital. It was Lenin's \nshortest major work, by a margin of many thousand words. \nLenin's motives in March-April 1917 for breaking with the \ntraditional Bolshevik strategy of revolution are obscure. The kindest interpretation, never offered by Lenin, is that \nThe April Theses were essentially a reproduction of the notebooks on \n'Marxism on the State'. 163 Lenin had begun, in the winter of 1916-\n17, to perceive Russia as being characterised by aspects of 'state \ncapitalism'; 164 but these were preliminary musings. On the other \nhand, he still acknowledged that Russia was not in the front rank of \nthe industrial powers, and in his 'Letters from Afar' urged the \nconcept of a 'revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the poorest peasants' for Russia. In fact the \nolder Bolshevik strategy had never been a clear two-stage revolu-\ntionary strategy. Thus there was but a short step from the \n'provisional revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletar-\niat and the peasantry' of 1905-6 to the 'revolutionary-democratic \ndictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest peasants' in 1917; and, \nregardless of Bolshevik intentions, the traditional strategy would \nalways have hobbled a 'bourgeois revolution' in Russia. 166 \nMoreover, the First World War and its political repercussions \ndominated Lenin's life after 1914, leading him to reject all persons \nand notions which appeared to him to fail to oppose imperialism in a \n Unsealed Messages \n157 \nfundamental fashion. 167 And Lenin in 1917 obviously sensed the \nexistence of a crack in the dam, giving him an opportunity to unleash \nthe flooding waters of history. \nBut surely Lenin, being a politician competing with other politicians, \nexperienced a temptation noted by political scientists with regard to \nmost openly-competitive systems of politics: namely to mark out for \nhimself an easily identifiable spot on the political spectrum; and, as \nan inveterate adherent of far-left socialist ideas, he felt himself at his \nmost comfortable when criticising other socialist parties and groups \nfor their insufficiency of radicalism. For example, the fourth thesis \nconceded that 'revolutionary defencism' was sincerely advocated by \na vast number of elected popular representatives in the soviets, and \nthat the Bolsheviks constituted merely a 'pale minority'. 171 Lenin \nalso admitted: 'Russia at the moment is the freest country in the \nworld of all the belligerent countries.' The Bolsheviks should \nconcentrate upon using the new political liberties. 172 Lenin's \nfinessing probably resulted from conversations in Sweden with \nBolsheviks in closer contact with Russian conditions than the \ncorrespondent of Zurcher Post, or from his exchanges with Kame-\nnev at the Finnish frontier. \nAt any rate, Lenin contended flatly that the workers' soviets were \n'the sole possible form of revolutionary government. The old state \nmachine ought to be superseded by a 'republic of soviets of workers', \nfarm-labourers' and peasants' deputies'; and payment of officials, all \nof whom should be elected to office and subject to instant recall by \ntheir electorate, should be at a rate no higher than the wage of a \n 158 \nLenin: A Political Life \n'good worker'. 174 Thesis Nine called for alterations m the party \nprogramme so as to incorporate ideas about imperialism and the \n'imperialist war' and to put forward 'our demand for a \"commune-\nstate'\".175 In economic policy Lenin had a couple of proposals. In \nThesis Six, he advocated land nationalisation (which he had failed to \nhave officially accepted by Bolsheviks in the past). 177 This, \naccording to Lenin's eighth thesis, signified not a scheme for instant \nsocialism but 'a transition immediately only to the control by the \nworkers' soviets over social production and the distribution of \nproducts'.' 179 Snappy, \ntruculent phrases abounded, often without being incorporated in \nfull sentences; and ideas were reiterated, despite Lenin's self-imposed \nconfines of space, to drive home the message. Despite the inelegance and the hurried composition, the \nrhetorical subtleties of Lenin's writing were arresting. 183 (Now there's a typical \nadverbial triptych for connoisseurs of Lenin's prose.184 (It may be thought that the phrasing betrays a \n Unsealed Messages \n159 \ncertain intellectualist condescension; but Lenin wrote The April \nTheses mainly for the party's leaders, central and local, who used \nsuch terminology regardless as to whether they were of middle-class \nor working-class background. 185 This was scarcely a \nplan of detailed guidance for Bolshevik organisers, but at least it \nadvised what was not to be done. Lenin knew that the April Theses \nwere merely a preliminary sketch. \nMost surprisingly, Lenin made no mention of the organisation of \nindustry under the proposed socialist regime. Equally striking \nwas Lenin's silence on the economic and social rights and duties of \nworkers, peasants and soldiers. He focused on politics and on the \nsoviets as the centre of political life; he made no mention of possible \nreforms in the running of factories; and the influence of workers over \nindustrial management was ignored. Nor did Lenin confront the \nproblems of relations between peasants in the rural economy once \nthe gentry had been removed: there was nothing in the theses on the \nhiring of labour or the renting of land. \nLenin's technique was to deliver assertions and demands, not \nexplanatory analysis. Lenin was emerging as a \nmaster of the channels of debate in his party, and a principal aspect \nof that mastery was his ability to give a wide berth to uncongenial \nissues. The \nrelations among the respective soviets of the workers, peasants, \nfarmworkers and soldiers were left unclear. It was also unclear \nwhether the workers' soviets would have powers superior to the \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsoviets of the other social groups. 188 Furthermore, the rural network \nof soviets was only patchily described; and Lenin, using a variety of \nformulations, gave scant guidance as how to settle relationships \namong the farmworkers, the poorest peasants and the peasantry as a \nwhole. 189 But the skimpiness of theory in The April Theses caused \nLenin himself no embarrassment. The April Theses were the first broad-ranging \nstatement of a fundamental Bolshevik alternative to the policies of \nKamenev and Stalin. Many Bolsheviks agreed on the desirability of \nanother revolution in Russia in the near future; but neither \nShlyapnikov nor any other Bolshevik radical had come forward \nwith quite so broad-ranging a schema. The theses instigated a bitter \ndispute among Bolsheviks, and Lenin had made striking contribution \nto the politics of Bolshevism after the February Revolution. \nApril to July 1917 \nFIGHTING FOR BOLSHEVISM \nThe February Revolution span the kaleidoscope of Russia's politics, \njolting the alliances and rivalries among the parties, and politicians \ngained a freedom of choice unrestricted by the Romanov monarchy. \nLenin's April Theses were the acme of free will. Yet no political \nleader, not even Lenin, could escape the constraints of circumstance \nin their entirety. the City Soviet.", "Political_Life_Lenin_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in 1917, were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Millions of people perished in \n67 \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after 1918, was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. \nLenin, like every other leader of the Second International, had \nsometimes predicted a continental war; indeed this was the common \nprognosis of most politicians and commentators regardless of \npolitical orientation. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. And yet he was little \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn 1914. \n Ad Extirpanda \n71 \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. Lenin conferred with \nZinoviev, and both of them relied heavily on their acquaintances. Bagocki was to recall that Lenin was agitated \nless by his personal situation than by the Second International \nleadership's reaction to the war. Lenin rightly stated that this implicitly \nbreached the assumptions of the Second International's anti-war \npolicy. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. Bagocki, Lenin stated bluntly: 'This is the end of \nthe Second International . From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. '9 There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. Not all socialist groups were swept up \nby the pro-war and patriotic frenzy. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war.16 \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn 7 August 1914 Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. Lenin remarked ruefully that his party \ncorrespondence was left untouched. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. Marek, a social-democratic \nparliamentarian in Austria-Hungary, to seek his intercession on \nLenin's behalf.18 This did not prevent Lenin's arrest on arrival in Nowy Targ \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nat eleven o'clock that morning, and he remained in custody until 19 \nAugust. 22 Adler and \nDiamand responded helpfully, declaring to the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs in Vienna that the suspected Russian spy Lenin was well-\nknown throughout Europe for his dedication to the 'struggle against \nRussian tsarism'. 23 Lenin's referees exaggerated his fame, but their \nwords had the desired effect.24 \nLenin returned to Bialy Dunajec. According to Hanecki, Lenin retained the fear that his \nlife might be in danger from the villagers. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. Not having a passport,29 Lenin could \nnot take a train across the Swiss frontier, but he invoked the name of \nGreulich and left for Switzerland on 2I August. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 33 But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. 34 \nANNOUNCING A POLICY \nSettling again in Switzerland, Lenin was a leader with an even \nsmaller following than in the pre-war period. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland. Lenin's readers amounted \nto a few hundred at most, and the overwhelming majority of those \nwere emigres.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. Socialism and the revolution, \nhe declared, had been betrayed. But Lenin maintained that neither the \nCentral Powers nor the Allies should be analysed so generously. 40 Its origins, \naccording to Lenin, lay in the international struggle for markets; it \nwas also an attempt to divide the international working-class \nmovement and to prevent revolution.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension.42 What caused controversy was Lenin's attitude to \nRussia. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov.46 And yet Lenin remained willing to \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. At the subsequent \ntrial, in February 1915, Kamenev disowned Lenin's defeatism. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. 56 Thus Lenin urged multilateral defeatism. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. For Plekhanov, Lenin had become an insane sloganeer \ninstead of a serious politician. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. He no longer had the slightest respect for \nany leading Marxist in Europe. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Lenin declared his opinion frankly: 'It \nwould not be a bad thing if the Germans took Riga, Tiflis and \nHelsingfors. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. Lenin also dubbed Golos ('The Voice') as the best in \nEurope.67 Lenin's \nalmost puerile stridency about 'European civil war' had no echo in \ntheir statements. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats. Lenin turned the paucity of surviving Central Committee \nmembers to his advantage.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective. Again, the imagery was florid with sexual innuendo; \nLenin was not so prim in print as in his outward behaviour.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. 79 \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. A minority of Europe's \nsocialists had sustained the line of International; the majority, as \nLenin increasingly pointed out, had broken it. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed.80 The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before 1914 in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. He did not bother with the ascendant party leaders who \nvoted in favour of war credits in the Reichstag; for him, they were \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbeneath contempt. Lenin was instead infuriated with Kautsky, Haase \nand their 'centrist' colleagues who refused to break unequivocally \nwith the rest of their party.81 He, \nunlike Lenin, recognised the patriotic mood of the German working \nclass. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis.82 Other Russian Marxists, however, believed that \nLenin and Zinoviev idealised German working-class attitudes.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution. Lenin referred to the problem only glancingly; the \ngreater problem, in his view, was constituted by the sins of the party \nleadership.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. 88 Plekhanov was nearer to Lenin in washing his hands of the \n Ad Extirpanda \n85 \nSecond International; but Lenin could not found a Third Interna-\ntional with a Plekhanov, who stoutly defended the necessity for \nGermany to be defeated. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. 89 Command over German socialism, according to Lenin, had \nbeen taken by the party's permanent paid officials; and he claimed \nthat these tacitly rejected revolutionary policies and had undergone a \nprocess of embourgeoisement.90 \nLenin denied that all organisations, regardless of political orienta-\ntion, eventually give rise to bureaucratic practices in response to the \ntechnical requirements of fast, informed and co-ordinated decision-\nmaking. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914.92 \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'. It had \nbecome a 'political detachment of the bourgeoisie'.93 \nWhere Zinoviev and Lenin marched intellectually, not only \nMichels but also European social-democratic leftists such as Rosa \nLuxemburg and Anton Pannekoek had gone before. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. In organisa-\ntional questions he remained predominantly a practical political \nleader in search of practical solutions; the broader issues of \ncontemporary political sociology passed him by. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. In Socialism and the War \nhe made his objective explicit. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' .95 Under such a slogan, no \nnon-Marxist would belong. Not even Marx had required a self-\nprofessedly Marxist International, and only Lenin and friends \nsuggested the formation of an International which would exclude \nMarxists deemed to have incorrect opinions. \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. Yet Lenin's \nhopes about Shlyapnikov were soon dashed. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. While accepting many strategical notions put forward by \nLenin, they objected to his pre-war writings on national self-\ndetermination and disliked his neglect of the peace movement. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. 106 Bukharin, in his \nown view, simply desired a switch of the party's focus of work from a \nRussian bourgeois revolution towards a European socialist revolu-\ntion; he did not deny that the forthcoming revolution in Russia \nwould be bourgeois. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure. Fourteen issues appeared in 1915, carrying twenty \nfour pieces by Lenin; he oversaw all stages of its production. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. 109 Kommunist was intended to provide a forum \nof Marxist intellectual discussion and to attract participation from \nleft-wing, anti-war socialists from other countries. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1908-\n9, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. His aim had been \nnot only to denigrate Aleksandr Bogdanov as a politician but also to \nindicate the kind of philosophy acceptable to Marxists: and \nPlekhanov's influence on Lenin's chapters had been strong. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. It was in \ncharacter for Lenin to jot this down, even in his private notes, in \nterms of the mistakes of others; at no point did he directly criticise \nhis own statements in Materialism and Empiriocriticism. \n Ad Extirpanda \n91 \nShortly before the outbreak of war he had signed a contract to \nwrite a short biographical piece on Karl Marx and already planned \nto include a summary of Marxian philosophy. 115 The biography was completed by \nNovember; but Lenin had by then started to fill many new note-\nbooks on philosophy. \nFeuerbach: all to trace Marxism to its theoretical underpinnings. Lenin, like most \nleading Russian revolutionary intellectuals, found such tasks of self-\neducation congenial (although few equalled his multilinguistic \ncompetence). 117 The fact that Lenin over-\nlooked the wartime writings of his adversaries indicates how deeply \nsubmerged he had become in his own theoretical quest. 119 Plekhanov had done a service, in Lenin's view, by \nattacking Kantianism. In fact, Plekhanov after 1914 came to discern \nhealthy sides in Kantianism; he even praised the call for moral \nimperatives in politics, and claimed that Marx's deployment of terms \nsuch as 'duty' and 'right' had displayed the same attitude. 120 Lenin \noverlooked Plekhanov's startling change of heart. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. 121 What Lenin held \nagainst Plekhanov was a mistake of longer standing: namely his \nneglect of the importance of Hegel. Lenin pointed out that Marxists \nin general had attended more to the writings of Feuerbach and G. \nConsequently not one Marxist has completely understood Marx in \nthe past half-century. According to Lenin, their philosophical outlook \nconsequently lacked dynamism, supplying a rationale not for \nauthentic Marxists but for those who were politically passive. Very important was Lenin's examination \nof Hegel's ideas about cognition. Lenin altered his reflection theory \nof knowledge. 126 This led Lenin to a further modification. Plekhanov had said this all along, and had been \nridiculed by Lenin's Materialism and Empiriocriticism for doing so. 128 \nNone the less, Lenin also went beyond Plekhanov in 1915 by \nasserting that the validity of concepts and categories was testable \nonly by their usefulness when applied to real situations. 130 The \ncloseness of standpoint is still more remarkable when Lenin's \nreconsiderations about ontology are taken into account. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. At 0\u00b0 C, for example, water changes its quality and becomes \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nice. 132 The idea of 'contradictions' and 'breaks' and 'interruptions of \ngradualness' were brought to the forefront of Lenin's philosophical \nwork. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. For Lenin still detested Kant, and still used \n'Kantian' as a term of abuse. Lenin at his \nbest was never more than a gifted reader of other philosophers' \nworks. \nImportant differences between the respective standpoints of Lenin \nand Bogdanov anyway remained. Lenin's publication of a second \nedition of Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1920 was not \nfortuitous. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world.) In addition, Lenin repeated that \nphilosophy was divided into two principal camps, materialism and \nidealism; 137 Bogdanov thought such affirmations to be neither \nprovable nor worthy of discussion. Lenin, moreover, continued to \ncategorise Hegel as a philosophical idealist while recognising his \nintuitive 'genius' and stating that Hegel had produced the 'embryos \nof dialectical materialism'. 138 Indeed Lenin declared, albeit to \nhimself: 'Intelligent idealism is nearer to intelligent materialism than \nis stupid materialism. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of 1915, when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'. 140 \nWhen all is said and done, Lenin failed to achieve internal \ncoherence in his newer philosophical views. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. Lenin's self-contradictions and explorations allow an \nastute scholar to select a wide range of ideas as sources of professed \ninfluence. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him. Lenin's \nphilosophical cerebrations did not precede and predetermine his \npolitics. \nFor Lenin, the toil in the Bern Public Library was well worthwhile; \nthe abundance of exclamation marks, whether in approval or \nexasperation, are sure signs that he was invigorated by the \nexperience.' 143 This is reminiscent of Lenin's invocation in \nWhat Is To Be Done. He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nD. Here was a \nframe of mind which sustained a lonely politician, far from home and \ndistant from power; and which, in 1917, left him uninhibited in \npromoting his party's seizure of the reins of government.", "Supervising_And_Correcting_1917": "", "Mass_Organisations_1917": " Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917. His call for greater participation was \nwelcomed by a series of speakers who told the Conference about \nthe growing power of mass organisations in their respective areas. The unofficial organisations \nthroughout the rest of the old empire were even more irksome: \nsoviets, trade unions and other mass organisations acted practically \nas they wished. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. But it was \nnot so embarrassing in the 'mass politics' of 1917. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. Workers and soldiers turned to \nother mass organisations for more radical solutions. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. Mass participation was vital.216 The organisational framework \nwas left imprecise. In May 1917 he wrote about the \ndesirability of governmental control 'over the trusts, over the \nbanks, over trade, over the \"parasites\" .", "Bolshevik_Tirades_1917": " 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir loyalty to their soviets as being primary; troops on the Eastern \nfront increasingly exhibited the same attitude. Soldiers demanded a relaxation of \ndiscipline and the permission to elect their own committees to \nrepresent their interests; and the Petrograd Soviet issued its 'Order \nNo. \nContinuing to think that socialism in backward Russia was a \npremature project and that national unity was essential in wartime, \nthey hoped to constrain the Provisional Government to act within \nthe limits of policies based on democratic political liberties and \nterritorial defence; and, immediately after the February Revolution, \nmost workers, peasants and soldiers felt likewise. Their votes \nprovided the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries with \nmajorities in the soviets. The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917.7 Returning \nto Petrograd, Lenin was adept in expressing popular attitudes which \nhad not yet fully developed.8 \nHis task was facilitated by the often-overlooked fact that even the \nprincipal leaders of the Bolshevik right, Kamenev and Stalin, had \nalready distanced themselves from the policies of contemporary \nMenshevism.9 At the beginning of April, this pair acted as major \nBolshevik spokesmen. It was they who were chosen by the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee to put the Bolshevik case at the \nassembly of soviet deputies, drawn from all over the country, which \nmet in Petrograd from 29 March. Kamenev and Stalin argued for \norganisational links with the Mensheviks (who supplied most \nrepresentatives to the gathering of deputies); they also won over \nthe Bolshevik fraction (or caucus) to the policy of conditional \nsupport for the Provisional Government 'insofar as it follows the \npath of satisfying the demands of the working class and the \nrevolutionary peasantry'. 10 Negotiations between the Bolshevik and \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik fractions proceeded on this basis. 11 Obviously, Stalin and \nKamenev were not following Lenin's line. Yet they were not cringing \nbefore Menshevism either: Stalin made clear his belief that the \nProvisional Government's days were numbered and that sooner or \nlater, after 'a break with the bourgeoisie', the soviets would assume \npower; 12 and Kamenev persuaded the Menshevik negotiators to \ncriticise even the Petrograd Soviet's foreign policy, to call for a \npublication of secret treaties and to repudiate the principle of 'civil \npeace' _13 Furthermore, other Bolshevik speakers emphasised the \nnecessity for a radical series of direct-action measures. 14 \nThe tentative agreements between the Bolshevik and Menshevik \nfractions did not hold. On 30 March, the Mensheviks and Bundists \nretracted their support from the motion criticising the Petrograd \nSoviet. 17 This would have excluded Men-\nshevik right-wingers; and, as Stalin must have realised, neither the \nMenshevik centrists nor the Menshevik leftists would have linked up \nwith the Bolsheviks on such terms. \nFor a few days, Tsereteli's ascendancy over Russian socialists \nseemed unshakeable. Tsereteli carried a motion of support for the \nPetrograd Soviet by 325 votes against 57 when the Bolsheviks and the \nMensheviks emerged from their respective fractions to debate at the \nnational conference of soviets; he even persuaded several Bolsheviks \nto the right of Kamenev, such as V. Lenin returned home at the moment \nwhen all Bolsheviks recognised the need for a wide-ranging discus-\nsion to formulate the general line of Bolshevik strategy and to put an \nend to all this fluidity. \n165 \nBolshevik right was anyway under persistent challenge. The radicals \nin the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee did not cease to \npress for overt opposition to the Provisional Government. Russian \nBureau member V. 19 \nIt was in this unstable situation that Lenin, arriving on 3 April, \ntalked into the night with Bolshevik leaders in the party's head-\nquarters in the Kshesinskaya Palace (which had simply been \nsequestred by force). 20 At noon next day he was accompanied by \nthem to the Tauride Palace where he spoke to about seventy \nBolsheviks and read out his April Theses. Voitinski, disturbed by \nwhat he had heard, suggested that the debate should be postponed \nand that the audience should adjourn to a joint meeting of \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks scheduled for the afternoon. Goldenberg, despite being Bolsheviks, spoke \nstrongly against him. Goldenberg, a Bolshevik who was moving over \nto Menshevism, shouted: 'Lenin has now made himself candidate for \none European throne vacant for thirty years: the throne of \nBakunin.'22 Mikhail Bakunin had not only been a founding father \nof anarchism in Russia and Europe in the nineteenth century but had \nalso been engaged in virulent disputes with Marx and Engels. Lenin \nwas not amused. Aleksandr Bogdanov, still more bluntly, called \nLenin's theses 'the ravings of a madman'; and Fyodor Dan called \nthem 'the party's funeral', adding that the 'bourgeois revolution' was \nincomplete. He accused Lenin of overlooking a Marxist \n'class analysis' and of failing to see that not every section of the \nRussian bourgeoisie had an interest in a war for territorial gain.23 \nEven the Bolsheviks at both meetings were stupefied and remained \nas yet unconvinced; apparently, only Aleksandra Kollontai spoke on \nLenin's behalf. Tsereteli asserted: 'However \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nirreconcilable Vladimir Ilich may be, I am convinced we'll be \nreconciled. 28 \nNor, seemingly, did any major local committee immediately come \nover to Lenin's support. 29 Lenin had no choice but to meet and talk \nto as many Bolsheviks as possible. 30 But his words were not \nautomatically accepted by Bolsheviks; the history of Bolshevism \nshowed this, and Lenin himself knew it. Lenin could not have made it clearer that he was calling \nfor a second revolution. Voitinski and those Bolsheviks \nwho opposed Kamenev's stand against Tsereteli quickly abandoned \nthe Bolsheviks altogether.32 The Bolshevik right wing was severely \nweakened. Furthermore, the Kamenevites who had manipulated \nPravda and buffeted the Russian Bureau in March did not reflect \nthe opinions of all Bolsheviks among lower committees, especially at \nthe district level, in Petrograd. \nThe scheduling of an All-Russian Bolshevik Conference for late \nApril opened windows of opportunity for Lenin. Local Bolshevik \nconferences had to be called and party policies had to be openly \ndebated. Only 15 per cent of Bolshevik delegates to the national \nsoviet conference in Petrograd from 29 March to 2 April were re-\nelected to the Conference which opened three weeks later. Some participants in the early \ngathering were pushed aside by the more prestigious leaders, who \nby then had returned from Siberian exile or, like Lenin, from \nemigration. Not even the \nMoscow Bolsheviks had dispatched representatives. 35 Almost cer-\ntainly the change of composition as between the national gathering \non 29 March and the Bolshevik April Conference also reflected the \nfact that rank-and-file Bolsheviks, when their opinion was consulted, \nchose leaders who approved of radical alternatives to Kamenev's \npolicies. The balance of opinion \namong the Bolsheviks was swinging his way, and The April Theses \naccelerated the process. The \nPetrograd Bolsheviks met on 14 April. 37 \nThis won over Bolsheviks like Prisedko who, in their own account, \nhad originally been frightened off by his ultra-radical talk. His original intention had been to specify that, if a general \npeace without annexations and indemnities could not be brought \nabout, a new socialist administration should fight a 'revolutionary \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwar' against imperialism. Specific objections were voiced, for \nexample, to the notion of a commune-state; evidently not all \nBolsheviks agreed with Lenin's critique of Kautsky's views on the \nstate. Goloshchekin, with a touch of exaggeration, declared: \n'You can sketch in whatever pattern for practical steps you like on \ncomrade Lenin's theses.44 \nHow representative were the Petrograd Bolsheviks in their move-\nment towards The April Theses is not yet known with precision; but, \nvery probably, party committees elsewhere in the country inclined in \nLenin's favour for similarly mixed motives, and not all of these \nimplied total submission to Lenin's will.45 Nor, of course, did the \nBolsheviks debate strategy in a political vacuum.46 Workers and soldiers, as all Bolsheviks \nwere aware, were still busily extending their rights; and already there \nwere signs that wage settlements would not keep pace with inflation.47 In such circumstances it was \nhard for Kamenev to win over the Bolsheviks with ideas of even \nconditional support for the Provisional Government. \nAnd yet it was probably a certain development in international \nrelations which improved Lenin's chances most of all. Mensheviks, Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries and Bolsheviks took to the streets in protest on 20 April; \nand, in view of the precedent whereby the monarchy had been \nbrought low by largely peaceful crowds of demonstrators, the Lvov \ncabinet was severely shaken.48 The Bolshevik Central Committee, at \nLenin's instigation, had encouraged the protest demonstration and \nsuggested that only a seizure of power by 'the revolutionary \nproletariat together with the revolutionary soldiers' could bring \nabout 'a truly democratic peace' . For the Bolsheviks, the 'April crisis' had profound \nconsequences. Those Bolshevik activists who had wavered between \nLenin and Kamenev were having their minds made up by the proof \nthat the Provisional Government was to be given neither conditional \nsupport nor even conditional trust. Little could now save Kamenev \nfrom defeat at the All-Russian Bolshevik Conference. Previous Conferences of Bolsheviks were held \nin Finland or in the emigration. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. \nOne hundred and fifty-two delegates attended, from nearly all \nmajor organisations associated with the Bolsheviks. His esteem among Bolsheviks had reached \nits highest point yet. Bubnov from the \nBolsheviks' Moscow Regional Bureau, who wanted clauses inserted \non the need to 'control' the Provisional Government since it had \nbecome 'counterrevolutionary'. Lenin reaffirmed that \n'lengthy work' was needed to persuade workers and peasants to \nfollow the Bolsheviks; and he acknowledged that it was still unclear \nhow successful the party would be with the peasantry. Rykov and S. Kuraev, a sympathiser with Lenin, \ncomplained about the absence of 'a sketch of the steps to be taken \ntowards socialist revolution in The April Theses.65 Bolsheviks since 1905 had urged \nthat only mass socialist organisations could ensure the establishment \nof a truly democratic order in Russia, so that Kamenev's call for a \ntransfer of governmental authority was not entirely unexpected. 70 Lenin and he could at any rate agree on several \npracticalities while clashing over underlying strategy and Marxist \ndefinitions. Perhaps he \nfound Bubnov's formulation to be too reminiscent of Trotski (who as \nyet remained a figure of suspicion among Bolsheviks). On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F. The Lenin-Kamenev line carried the day. \nThis provoked Lenin to remark that Petrograd and Moscow were \nnow lagging behind the provinces in revolutionary achievement. The crux of his remarks was that \nthe Bolsheviks, on coming to power, should 'openly propose a \n There Is Such a Party.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' .80 Be that as it may, \nLenin's motion was passed nem. Yet he \nnodded gently in the direction of the Bolshevik right wing, saying \nthat the Constituent Assembly might embody the new power. The second was that he commented that land \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnationalisation would 'ineluctably give a push towards wider \nmeasures'. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. \nAngarski from Moscow, questioned Lenin's arguments at all. At least two \nother Bolshevik leaders, Iosif Stalin and M. 89 \nThis drastic reversal of the defeats sustained at the hands of his \nown Bolsheviks in 1905-7 was accomplished with little discussion. So was \nLenin's on the need to start work on the writing of a new party \nprogramme. Fedorov, member of the \nPetersburg City Committee (which refused to change its name to the \nPetrograd Committee as a protest against the government's 'chau-\nvinism' in renaming the capital), reported on the progress of the \nPetrograd Soviet debate on the acceptability of a government \ncoalition of liberals and socialists. The proceedings continued with Zinoviev's report \non the need for the Bolsheviks to unite with all social-democrats \nregarded by them as truly internationalist in orientation. \n175 \nInterdistricters were close in strategy to Trotski; and Zinoviev, \ndeliberately or not, was initiating a process which culminated in \nTrotski's entry to the Bolshevik party in July. In accordance with \nthe pre-war writings of Lenin and Stalin, the report stressed the \ndesirability of dissuading non-Russian nationalities from exercising \nthat right. Unhappiness with Lenin's attitude to the national question \nhad long been widespread among Bolsheviks, and the section \nestablished by the Conference to formulate a motion refused to \ngive approval to Stalin's viewpoint. Pyatakov;92 and Pyatakov, Lenin's opponent on \nthe national question, was not minded to give way to Stalin.93 Lenin's ripost was his \nmost passionate contribution to the Conference: 'There's no people \nwhich could be so pervaded by hatred to Russia, there's no people \nwhich could so terribly not love Russia as the Poles. Lenin professed a readiness to contemplate the \nsecession of the Ukrainians as well as the Poles and the Finns; but \nhe predicted that the Ukraine would in the event be content with a \n'fraternal union' with Russia.95 Stalin's final speech dwelt on the \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nusefulness of the national liberation movement as a 'bridge' between \nEast and West.97 There had been \nresistance to Kamenev's standing when the candidatures had been \ndiscussed in closed session because of his behaviour in the Bolshevik \ncourt case of 1915, but Lenin came to his rescue, arguing the need to \nlet bygones be bygones98. Evidently he felt that there was enough \ncommon ground between himself and the leader of the Bolshevik \nright to keep him in the Central Committee; and perhaps he already \nvalued him as a potential counterweight to leftists who might want to \nforce the revolutionary pace even faster than Lenin himself wanted.99 But Lenin and Zinoviev did not get things all \ntheir own way. Sverdlov, whom \nLenin neither knew much about nor wanted in the Central \nCommittee. 101 \nNone of Lenin's colleagues were his stooges, and several were \nhostile to his general strategy. So Lenin would not be able \nto push through his decisions because his colleagues were under \narrest or dispersed in various countries. Even Zinoviev was willing to \ntake him on, urging the Conference to dispatch a representative to \nthe socialist peace conference in Stockholm in order to increase \nBolshevik influence over the European socialist left. 102 Lenin, however, could feel \nsatisfied. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. \nAGAINST DUAL POWER \nThe Bolshevik All-Russian Conference's resolution forbidding social-\nists to enter the Provisional Government was passed in a week when \nLvov was negotiating for Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries to \njoin his cabinet. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. 105 In Petrograd, the \nVyborg District Soviet was solidly hostile to the cabinet after the \nFebruary Revolution. Most soviets, especially at the city level, \nremained in the hands of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries. But the lower the level, the stronger the representation of the \nBolsheviks. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' .106 \nBolsheviks concluded that it was only a matter of time and \npolitical effort, before the Petrograd Soviet fell to them, and those \namong them who still hankered after a united Russian Social-\n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDemocratic Labour Party with the Mensheviks diminished. The \nliaison between the Kadet party and the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries strengthened Bolshevik intransigence. This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. For Lenin, it \nwas the heyday of his public appearances. 110 \nBolshevik Central Committee policies were modified for popular \nconsumption. The Central Commit-\ntee simplified the April Party Conference's resolutions, which were \nphrased in terms impervious to most non-Marxists, and indeed many \nBolsheviks. Lenin sketched a draft calling for 'no \nsupport' for the Provisional Government and for an end to the war \nwithout annexations and indemnities and with full self-determination \nfor all peoples. 112 Both Lenin and the \nCentral Committee, moreover, avoided mention of the possibility of \n'revolutionary war' or 'European civil war'. These topics continued \nto be addressed among Bolshevik leaders through 1917; but there was \na recognition that such talk would not gain universal approval on the \nstreets. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. 115 Before 1917 his policies had been aimed more at \ngetting support in his party than at communicating with Russian \nsociety; he had seldom worried lest his provocative declarations \nmight prove unacceptable to workers and peasants. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. The scheme for an armed march of protest against \nthe Provisional Government, coinciding with the convocation of the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, was \ninstigated by members of the Bolshevik Military Organisation. \nLenin, without being in constant touch with the Military Organisa-\ntion, had a host of admirers among its leading cadre. Thus their radical-\nism overspilled the bounds respected by Lenin himself since the All-\nRussian April Conference of the Bolshevik party. \n181 \nThis was the nearest any Bolshevik had come since the February \nRevolution to stating how the Provisional Government might be \noverthrown. The Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries held their expected majority; only lOS out \nof 777 were Bolsheviks. It was the high point of the anti-\nBolshevik socialist movement in Russia; and the alliance of Men-\nsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries easily dominated the Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets which was elected to \nassume the functions of national soviet leadership. \nOn the second day, 4 June, Lenin was given the chance to reply on \nbehalf of the Bolsheviks. Lenin exclaimed: 'I reply: \"There \nis. But it was \napparent that the Bolsheviks lacked the support in the country for \nany attempt at the formation of a government. The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. Not even many Bolshevik \ndelegates to the Congress knewY0 A joint meeting of the Central \nCommittee, Military Organisation and the Petersburg Committee's \nExecutive Commission took place on 6 June while the Congress was \nin session; and, behind closed doors, the case for a demonstration \nwas offered by Military Organisation leader N. A clash between Lenin and \nNogin ensued; and Nogin vehemently expostulated: 'Lenin is \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposing a revolution.' 122 But Lenin ignored Nogin's interpretation of his inten-\ntions. It would indeed seem that Lenin was aspiring not to the \ninstallation of a Bolshevik government but rather a transfer of power \nto the soviets, which would have resulted in a government of \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. The Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships were worried by the posters \npinned up around Petrograd by Bolshevik activists. The scene was set for the first \ntest of strength between the Bolsheviks and the Provisional Govern-\nment.127 \nLenin panicked. \nOutvoted, Lenin and Sverdlov abstained. 129 \nThe worry for Lenin was the attitude which might be taken by the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. \nTsereteli objected to Lenin's casual temerity in initiating the \ndemonstration and treated his activity as part of a conspiracy to \nset up a Bolshevik government. His \nvehemence, moreover, was opposed even by several non-Bolsheviks. \nMartov spoke against the proposal for the Bolsheviks to be \nphysically disarmed. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. 131 The result, on 12 June, was that \nthe Bolsheviks were merely censured for recklessness. The Bolsheviks \nparticipated in the demonstration with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries even though there were frictions over the \nBolshevik party's insistence on marching under its own slogans, \nincluding 'All Power To The Soviets'. 133 \nA LEADER ON CAMPAIGN \nDoubts about Lenin's mettle as a revolutionary leader were \nsurfacing. \nThe displeasure was intense since it was the Petersburg Committee's \nactivists and not Lenin who had the uncongenial task of dissuading \nagitated crowds of anti-governmental workers, soldiers and sailors \n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom undertaking a demonstration which the Central Committee had \nencouraged. Nearly all participants in the debate in the Petersburg \nCommittee criticised Lenin's leadership directly or by implication. 134 \nHe survived their anger mainly because no Bolshevik figure on the \nparty's left offered himself as an alternative leader and because he \nhandled his defence with firmness and discretion. 135 \nHe was helped by his status as the whipping boy of the anti-\nBolshevik press. Most onlookers found the similarities rather \nthan the differences between the Kadets and the non-Bolshevik \nsocialists most impressive. Lenin and his party, by contrast, opposed \nthe entire historic compromise between Russian liberalism and \nRussian 'moderate' socialism; and the barrage of invective fired at \nhim in national newspapers served to enhance his eminence. 137 The net effect of \nthe vilification, at least until early July, was to disseminate the \nproposals of the Bolsheviks more widely. 138 \nLenin and his associates, however, were perturbed by the smear \ncampaign. The party in the provinces expressed its concern, and \nrequests were made to the Central Committee to counter the anti-\nBolshevik tirades by publishing information on the real Lenin, his \nbackground and personality. Lenin began a sketch of his life. 142 Bolsheviks were evidently not \nintending to establish a 'cult' around him. They recognised Lenin \nas their party chief with fewer reservations than the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had about Viktor Chernov or even the Kadets \nabout Pavel Milyukov; 143 but they held back from adulation. The \n'heartfelt greetings' sent by a 7000-strong meeting of workers in \nBogorodsko-Glukhovo to 'the respected fighter and leader of the \nworking class, comrade Lenin' was more the exception than the \nnorm, 144 and Lenin did not pursue exceptional treatment for himself. But even if this is what he was \ndoing, it may well have stemmed from Lenin's instincts rather than \nhis conscious choice: his was not a self-inquiring mind. \nAnd so, whereas the rest of the press presented him as an \nindividual politician capable of bringing down the Provisional \nGovernment, Lenin as ever did not emphasise the word 'I' and \npreferred phrases like 'we, the workers'. 146 He did not lose this combativeness, but \nincreasingly he looked more like a working-class Bolshevik than a \nmiddle-class pedagogue; he obviously found the revolutionary \nenvironment congenial. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHe proved adept too at mass oratory. May and June 1917 were busy months for him. \nBesides Central Committee sessions and local party occasions in \nPetrograd, Lenin had to address eleven large gatherings. Lenin suggested that \nwhatever deprivations needed to be made would be paid for by the \nenemies of the working class. 149 \nThis message, with its combination of invocation and reassurance, \nmust have contributed to Lenin's advance on power. After his spectacular and rapturous \nreception at the Finland station on 3 April, he found non-Bolshevik \naudiences less enthusiastic for several weeks. He knew about the provincial political \nprocesses only from newspapers and from Bolshevik activists coming \nto Petrograd for meetings, conferences and congresses \nThis also meant that direct knowledge of Lenin the man was \nthinly-spread in the rest of the country. This was not, at least not yet, the Bolshevik \nparty's style. Bolsheviks printed most pictures of their leaders later in \nthe year, after they had seized power. The contemporary anti-\nBolshevik press saw no advantage in publishing photos of Lenin; \ncartoonists had sport with him, but usually provided a passe-partout \ndrawing of evil and made no attempt at realistic portraiture. \nConsequently Lenin's impact upon general politics in Russia \nstemmed in large measure from his newspaper articles. The year \n1917 was the golden age of Russian print journalism, and Lenin \ndevoted more hours per day to writing for Pravda- he wrote little for \nother Bolshevik outlets- than to any other political function. Only the villages, which had hardly any Bolshevik party \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngroups, were left outside the normal distribution network. Even so, it must be added that nearly \nhalf the copies were sold in Petro grad and that therefore not even all \nliterate Bolshevik rank-and-filers can have read the words of their \nparty leader). 157 \nLenin was Pravda's regular columnist on current political issues; \nand in this role he especially aimed to acquire the support of \nBolshevik committee-men in Petrograd and the localities for his \nstrategy. Using \na term invented by the Bolshevik versifier Demyan Bedny, he called \nthem 'Liberdans' . \nAnd Lenin, like his Central Committee colleagues, carried a heavy \nload of responsibilities on the Bolshevik party's behalf. Lenin and Krupskaya were relieved of the \nbusiness of correspondence with local party committees. Moreover, it was Kamenev's \nmain job to direct the Bolshevik fraction in the Petrograd Soviet \n(whereas Lenin, the great advocate of 'all power to the soviets' in the \n There Is Such a Party. \n189 \nspring, was not elected to the Soviet). Nogin, at his own \ninsistence, worked in the Moscow Soviet. Sverdlov ran the Central Committee Secretariat with a \nsmall but efficient staff and, like Stalin, was among the less 'visible' \nfigures in the Bolshevik leadership. 163 Despite Lenin's doubts about \nhim at the April Bolshevik Conference, Sverdlov could hardly have \nbeen closer to Lenin's policies, and his indefatigable service to the \nCentral Committee and its Secretariat freed Lenin to focus on his \nchosen activities. Zinoviev, too, was emerging as a figure of substance \non the Bolshevik right. A similar mixture of rancour and \npolitical calculation held back leading anti-Lenin Bolsheviks from \nthe pre-war period, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov. They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. A Pravda editorial, in a curious hint about his \nproblem, reported that the invitation had been made 'in the name of \ncomrade Lenin and several Central Committee members' . Even before the February Revolution, as Lenin \nand Zinoviev noted, he had denounced Chkheidze and the Men-\nshevik Duma deputies; 168 and, upon his return to Russia, he agreed \nwith the Bolsheviks that a rupture was desirable with the Menshevik \nleaders who condoned the coalition with the Kadets. He felt that \nLenin, whether he said so or not, had embraced the Trotskyist theory \nof 'permanent revolution' in place of the traditional two-stage \nrevolutionary schedule; and indeed, after joining the Bolsheviks, \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski defended his strategy of 1905-6 with enthusiasm in Bolshevik \npublications. 169 He was not constrained to defer to Lenin, who \nwelcomed Trotski's adhesion to the Bolsheviks not only since he was \nan increasingly needed advocate of radicalism but also because of his \ntechnical and oratorical skills; and he was asked to help with the \nediting of 'a popular organ'; 170 No Bolshevik leader could match his \nrecord in this respect. The development of Lenin as a chairman of \nBolshevik opinion and as a leader who could coax unlikely partners \nto co-operate had begun. This was the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee (or VTsiK), and its leading members were Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries as well as some Bundists. \nThese Bolsheviks could barely believe that the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee, which had relations with virtually all soviets in \ncities and on the Eastern front, refused to take power from the \nKadets. Not surprisingly, Lenin found it difficult to strike the balance \nbetween enunciating a radical strategy and restraining his adherents \nfrom its premature application. This time, however, such a manoeuvre \nwas impossible; Lenin himself had to administer 'a cold shower' of \ndiscouragement to activists who thought they were pursuing his line \nof action. 177 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Petersburg Committee was also in session on 20 June. And yet it was precisely \nnow, on 29 June, that Lenin felt able to take a rest for a few days in \nNeivola, a village in the Finnish countryside some four or five hours \ndistant from Petrograd by local train. In any case he noted \njocularly that, even when he withdrew from speaking engagements in \norder to recuperate, the enemies of the Bolsheviks nevertheless \nclaimed he had turned up and demagogically roused the crowds to \nfury. Noskov. 181 In midsummer 1917 the political stakes were much \nhigher, and yet Lenin unconcernedly departed to stay in Vladimir \nBonch-Bruevich's rural dacha. 182 Unintentionally, this leader, who \nthought no one equalled his competence in dealing with affairs at the \napex of the Bolshevik party, was leaving the Central Committee to \nface alone the party's most fiendishly difficult test since the February \nRevolution. Low-level Bolshevik activists were involved. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. 185 Bolsheviks in the \nparty's lower echelons did little to restrain the crowds; some of them \nactively fomented trouble. When the news reached the Petrograd \nBolshevik City Conference, the delegates ignored the Central \nCommittee's prohibition and offered to lead the demonstration 'if \nthis proved necessary'. \nBut they would not budge, to the delight of a Bolshevik All-Russian \nBureau of Military Organisations which announced its readiness to \nguide the demonstration. But the \nBolshevik leadership, in the Petersburg Committee and in the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisations, were following rather \nthan guiding events; and, although most participants hoped that the \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nturmoil would somehow result in the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment, they had no definite set of tactics. The worry \npersisted that the outcome would not be happy, and the Bolshevik \ncentral leaders wanted to take as few obviously incriminating steps as \npossible. 193 Lenin and his companions, \nBonch-Bruevich and his sister Mariya dressed hurriedly. They made for the \nKshesinskaya palace to seek out the Bolshevik leaders. Sverdlov and \nAnatoli Lunacharski addressed them from the balcony; and Lenin, \nwho had in the meantime arrived, was asked to come out to say a few \nwords. Pereverzev, \ncontacting troops in the capital who had not declared support for \neither side, released the bits of circumstantial information in the \nhands of the authorities which purported to show that Lenin was a \nGerman spy. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. The \nBolshevik Central Committee called on the crowds to leave the \nstreets.200 \nWhen Lenin was faced with the angry disappointment of the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisation's leaders, he responded \nwith a barrage of detailed, operational questions as to what forces \ncould be deployed if the demonstration was to be revived. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. \nLenin declared that the revolutionary process was entering a critical \nphase. The Bolshevik \nparty needed to make tactical adjustments to survive and flourish \nagain.204 \nESCAPE TO THE LAKES \nAnti-Bolshevik repression had ensued in Petrograd. The deaths of \ndemonstrators ran into the hundreds, and there were many reports of \nviolence being meted out to known or suspected Bolsheviks \nencountered on the streets. \nTrotski and Lunacharski, despite not belonging to the Bolshevik \nparty, had been involved in negotiations about the demonstration; \nthey too were sought by troops loyal to the Provisional Govern-\nment. The exceptions were Lenin and Zinoviev. This was odd \nin its way since Lenin was guiltless, unless it was a crime to take a \nholiday when great events were in the making. As regards Zinoviev, \nhe retained a reputation as a radical Bolshevik but was by now closer \nto Kamenev than to Lenin, and had opposed the demonstration from \nits conception. They had consistently \nrepudiated the accusation, taking space in Bolshevik newspapers to \nexplain their story and to stress that they would have returned via \nFrance and the North Sea if only the Allied authorities had given \npermission. \n197 \nBurtsev had spent a career exposing police agents in the Russian \nrevolutionary movement; Aleksinski was a former Bolshevik whose \nhostility to Lenin had induced him to found a newspaper, Without \nSuperfluous Words, dedicated wholly to the exposure of Bolshevik \nmisdeeds. 207 \nEven so, Lenin and Zinoviev initially thought to deliver themselves \nup to the authorities on condition that the Petrograd Soviet would \nguarantee physical protection and a fair trial. 208 Several Bolsheviks \nadvised this.209 It was Kamenev's less than totally defiant \ncomportment at his trial in 1915 that continued to earn him \ncontempt among fellow Bolsheviks after the February Revolu-\ntion. The additional consideration was that all revolutionary parties, \nincluding the Bolsheviks, assumed that no single leader's fate should \nbe put before the good of the party and the Revolution. 211 \nBy then, however, several newspapers were baying for Lenin's blood. \nGruesome cartoons depicted Lenin on a scaffold.212 But Bolshevik \ncalls for him to surrender himself to the authorities subsided, and \nLenin and Zinoviev went into hiding in the capital.214 For \nthe next month they stayed with the Bolshevik and factory worker \nNikolai Emelyanov, who had, like many Russian workers, retained a \nhouse and some land in the countryside. Lenin and Zinoviev slept in \nthe barn-loft. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe two men felt able to stroll around so long as they took \nreasonable care, but scares sometimes happened. On one occasion \nthe sight of approaching armed men caused Lenin and Zinoviev to \ndive into a haystack. Lenin whispered to his companion: 'The only \nthing left now is to die decently. The Provisional Government's repressive zeal was fading \nsomewhat, and Lenin and Zinoviev received secret visits from \nBolshevik Central Committee members. 218 By 26 \nJuly, Lenin's articles were appearing in it.'220 \nYet Lenin and Zinoviev felt insecure even near Sestroretsk. A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN. For Kerenski, Lenin was only the tip of \n There Is Such a Party.221 \nLenin desired to put greater distance between Petrograd and \nhimself. The Bolshevik party had a warm relationship with. \nSuccessful overtures were made on Lenin's behalf to obtain \nsanctuary in Finland proper. Lenin had a photo-\ngraph taken of his self-transformation. This time Lenin \nmasqueraded as an engine stoker.226 Lenin pressed on \nwith his research for The State and Revolution, and continued to \nsubmit articles to the Bolshevik central newspapers and to write to \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee. 227 \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Finns made Lenin's contacts with the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee easier than they had been in Razliv. Nor did he expect the existing chance of a \nBolshevik assumption of power to recur: it was now or never. \n 7 The Fire Next Time: \nJuly to September 1917 \nCONSIDERATIONS ON PARTY STRATEGY \nThe internal life of parties in revolutionary Russia ran on the basis of \npersuasion and consent. The Bolsheviks were feared for their \ndiscipline and hierarchy; and yet their party was, by the standards \nof its own rulebook, highly ill-disciplined.tensions affected relations at all \nlevels of the Bolshevik party's formal hierarchy. Thus the Bolsheviks \nwere not so unlike the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as \nlater mythology contended; 1 and the fact that the Bolshevik party \nwas ill co-ordinated allowed its local activists to react dynamically to \nthe particularity of local events. The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. Being \ninnocent of the co-responsibility for the Provisional Government \nwhich affected their rivals, Bolsheviks could organise their political \ncampaign unfettered. The disagreements among the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries led instead to factionalism; both had left \nwings which wanted to break with the Kadets entirely: and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries were to split into two separate parties in \nNovember 1917. In these conditions it was natural for dissentient \nleftists at lower levels to leave and join the Bolsheviks. On 10 July 1917, already on the run, \nhe penned, 'The Political Situation (Four Theses)' for submission to \n201 \n.", "Conscription_Of_Millions_1917": " In 1917 they argued that the \nland could not be handed over to the peasants without disrupting \nagriculture in the short term, diminishing the supply of food to the \ntowns and tempting soldiers to desert and return to their native \nvillages. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917.' The war, he added, was imperialistic \nand could be ended 'only by worldwide revolution'.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' . The conscription of millions \nof able-bodied young males to the armed forces had reduced the \nnumber of mouths to feed in peasant communes and had diminished \nthe pressure on peasant families to seek work on the landed gentry's \nestates. 109 \nBut the liberals had the consolation that the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries still wanted them to govern, and that \nKerenski in particular, as Minister of Army and Navy Affairs, had \nmoved closer to their viewpoint; they also retained, in the person of \nM. But it was \nnot so embarrassing in the 'mass politics' of 1917. May and June 1917 were busy months for him. To be sure, he was still not writing in expectation \nof being read by the entire literate working class; but he did at least \nhope to reach out to all members of his party: and three fifths of \nthese in 1917, it is reckoned, were labourers of some sort. \n191 \nestates rose in number from June 1917. 173 War-weariness was also \ngrowing, especially among the troops. The Provisional Government was \nhumiliated, and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nincurred criticism for acceding to Kadet militarism. On 10 July 1917, already on the run, \nhe penned, 'The Political Situation (Four Theses)' for submission to \n201 \n.", "Bolshevik_Central_Committee_Policies_1917": " 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir loyalty to their soviets as being primary; troops on the Eastern \nfront increasingly exhibited the same attitude. Soldiers demanded a relaxation of \ndiscipline and the permission to elect their own committees to \nrepresent their interests; and the Petrograd Soviet issued its 'Order \nNo. \nContinuing to think that socialism in backward Russia was a \npremature project and that national unity was essential in wartime, \nthey hoped to constrain the Provisional Government to act within \nthe limits of policies based on democratic political liberties and \nterritorial defence; and, immediately after the February Revolution, \nmost workers, peasants and soldiers felt likewise. Their votes \nprovided the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries with \nmajorities in the soviets. 5 Furthermore, the left wings of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries proved to be indecisive \nand ill-led; and few of their representatives held the objective of \nforming an all-socialist coalition. The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917.7 Returning \nto Petrograd, Lenin was adept in expressing popular attitudes which \nhad not yet fully developed.8 \nHis task was facilitated by the often-overlooked fact that even the \nprincipal leaders of the Bolshevik right, Kamenev and Stalin, had \nalready distanced themselves from the policies of contemporary \nMenshevism.9 At the beginning of April, this pair acted as major \nBolshevik spokesmen. It was they who were chosen by the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee to put the Bolshevik case at the \nassembly of soviet deputies, drawn from all over the country, which \nmet in Petrograd from 29 March. Kamenev and Stalin argued for \norganisational links with the Mensheviks (who supplied most \nrepresentatives to the gathering of deputies); they also won over \nthe Bolshevik fraction (or caucus) to the policy of conditional \nsupport for the Provisional Government 'insofar as it follows the \npath of satisfying the demands of the working class and the \nrevolutionary peasantry'. 10 Negotiations between the Bolshevik and \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik fractions proceeded on this basis. Later accounts have \nportrayed these negotiations as yet another case of Kamenev and \nStalin behaving cravenly in Lenin's absence. 11 Obviously, Stalin and \nKamenev were not following Lenin's line. Yet they were not cringing \nbefore Menshevism either: Stalin made clear his belief that the \nProvisional Government's days were numbered and that sooner or \nlater, after 'a break with the bourgeoisie', the soviets would assume \npower; 12 and Kamenev persuaded the Menshevik negotiators to \ncriticise even the Petrograd Soviet's foreign policy, to call for a \npublication of secret treaties and to repudiate the principle of 'civil \npeace' _13 Furthermore, other Bolshevik speakers emphasised the \nnecessity for a radical series of direct-action measures. 14 \nThe tentative agreements between the Bolshevik and Menshevik \nfractions did not hold. 17 This would have excluded Men-\nshevik right-wingers; and, as Stalin must have realised, neither the \nMenshevik centrists nor the Menshevik leftists would have linked up \nwith the Bolsheviks on such terms. Tsereteli carried a motion of support for the \nPetrograd Soviet by 325 votes against 57 when the Bolsheviks and the \nMensheviks emerged from their respective fractions to debate at the \nnational conference of soviets; he even persuaded several Bolsheviks \nto the right of Kamenev, such as V. Lenin returned home at the moment \nwhen all Bolsheviks recognised the need for a wide-ranging discus-\nsion to formulate the general line of Bolshevik strategy and to put an \nend to all this fluidity. The idea that Kamenev and Stalin would have \nco-operated, or would even have been permitted to co-operate \ncontentedly, with the Mensheviks without extracting large conces-\nsions on policy if only Lenin had not taken his 'sealed train' through \nGermany is implausible. Kamenev's sympathisers, while not agreeing \nwith Lenin, distrusted the Mensheviks; and the position of the \n There Is Such a Party. \n165 \nBolshevik right was anyway under persistent challenge. The radicals \nin the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee did not cease to \npress for overt opposition to the Provisional Government. Russian \nBureau member V. Molotov and the City Committee member \nN. 19 \nIt was in this unstable situation that Lenin, arriving on 3 April, \ntalked into the night with Bolshevik leaders in the party's head-\nquarters in the Kshesinskaya Palace (which had simply been \nsequestred by force). 20 At noon next day he was accompanied by \nthem to the Tauride Palace where he spoke to about seventy \nBolsheviks and read out his April Theses. Chkheidze, as chairman of the afternoon meeting, gave the \nplatform to Lenin to expatiate on his theses. Goldenberg, despite being Bolsheviks, spoke \nstrongly against him. Goldenberg, a Bolshevik who was moving over \nto Menshevism, shouted: 'Lenin has now made himself candidate for \none European throne vacant for thirty years: the throne of \nBakunin. Lenin \nwas not amused. Aleksandr Bogdanov, still more bluntly, called \nLenin's theses 'the ravings of a madman'; and Fyodor Dan called \nthem 'the party's funeral', adding that the 'bourgeois revolution' was \nincomplete. Steklov argued that Lenin underestimated the \nconcessions wrung from the Provisional Government. He accused Lenin of overlooking a Marxist \n'class analysis' and of failing to see that not every section of the \nRussian bourgeoisie had an interest in a war for territorial gain.23 \nEven the Bolsheviks at both meetings were stupefied and remained \nas yet unconvinced; apparently, only Aleksandra Kollontai spoke on \nLenin's behalf. Tsereteli asserted: 'However \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nirreconcilable Vladimir Ilich may be, I am convinced we'll be \nreconciled.24 \nOn 6 April, Kamenev attacked Lenin's views at the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee.25 Further debate was called for, \nand Lenin's theses appeared in Pravda on 7 April. The Petersburg City Committee \nrejected Lenin's April Theses by thirteen votes to two on 8 April. 28 \nNor, seemingly, did any major local committee immediately come \nover to Lenin's support. 29 Lenin had no choice but to meet and talk \nto as many Bolsheviks as possible. 30 But his words were not \nautomatically accepted by Bolsheviks; the history of Bolshevism \nshowed this, and Lenin himself knew it. Pravda on 9 April carried Lenin's article 'On Dual Power', \nwhich addressed the question about the Provisional Government's \nfate: 'It must be overthrown since it is oligarchical, bourgeois and not \na government of the whole people; it cannot give peace or bread or \nfull freedom. Lenin could not have made it clearer that he was calling \nfor a second revolution. Voitinski and those Bolsheviks \nwho opposed Kamenev's stand against Tsereteli quickly abandoned \nthe Bolsheviks altogether.32 The Bolshevik right wing was severely \nweakened. Furthermore, the Kamenevites who had manipulated \nPravda and buffeted the Russian Bureau in March did not reflect \nthe opinions of all Bolsheviks among lower committees, especially at \nthe district level, in Petrograd. \nThe scheduling of an All-Russian Bolshevik Conference for late \nApril opened windows of opportunity for Lenin. Local Bolshevik \nconferences had to be called and party policies had to be openly \ndebated. Only 15 per cent of Bolshevik delegates to the national \nsoviet conference in Petrograd from 29 March to 2 April were re-\nelected to the Conference which opened three weeks later. Some participants in the early \ngathering were pushed aside by the more prestigious leaders, who \nby then had returned from Siberian exile or, like Lenin, from \nemigration. The national soviet conference, moreover, had not \nincluded representatives from all local committees. Not even the \nMoscow Bolsheviks had dispatched representatives. 35 Almost cer-\ntainly the change of composition as between the national gathering \non 29 March and the Bolshevik April Conference also reflected the \nfact that rank-and-file Bolsheviks, when their opinion was consulted, \nchose leaders who approved of radical alternatives to Kamenev's \npolicies. This occurred, moreover, before Lenin had a chance to \ncontact Conference delegates except through the medium of his brief \nand patchily-argued articles in Pravda. The balance of opinion \namong the Bolsheviks was swinging his way, and The April Theses \naccelerated the process. The \nPetrograd Bolsheviks met on 14 April. 37 \nThis won over Bolsheviks like Prisedko who, in their own account, \nhad originally been frightened off by his ultra-radical talk. His original intention had been to specify that, if a general \npeace without annexations and indemnities could not be brought \nabout, a new socialist administration should fight a 'revolutionary \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwar' against imperialism. This did not find favour with a gathering \nwhich wanted to stress the party's ability to bring about peace rather \nthan to intensify war; and Lenin, however reluctantly, agreed to omit \nthe slogan from the final resolution. Specific objections were voiced, for \nexample, to the notion of a commune-state; evidently not all \nBolsheviks agreed with Lenin's critique of Kautsky's views on the \nstate.41 Moreover, it actually helped Lenin \nthat his April Theses were not a finished product and left much to be \ndecided. Goloshchekin, with a touch of exaggeration, declared: \n'You can sketch in whatever pattern for practical steps you like on \ncomrade Lenin's theses.'42 He was at least right that Lenin's policies \nleft many options open.44 \nHow representative were the Petrograd Bolsheviks in their move-\nment towards The April Theses is not yet known with precision; but, \nvery probably, party committees elsewhere in the country inclined in \nLenin's favour for similarly mixed motives, and not all of these \nimplied total submission to Lenin's will.45 Nor, of course, did the \nBolsheviks debate strategy in a political vacuum. Yakovlev noted that the peasants were already taking radical \ndirect-action measures without waiting for any political party to \ninstigate them to do so.46 Workers and soldiers, as all Bolsheviks \nwere aware, were still busily extending their rights; and already there \nwere signs that wage settlements would not keep pace with inflation.47 In such circumstances it was \nhard for Kamenev to win over the Bolsheviks with ideas of even \nconditional support for the Provisional Government. \nAnd yet it was probably a certain development in international \nrelations which improved Lenin's chances most of all.48 The Bolshevik Central Committee, at \nLenin's instigation, had encouraged the protest demonstration and \nsuggested that only a seizure of power by 'the revolutionary \nproletariat together with the revolutionary soldiers' could bring \nabout 'a truly democratic peace' . It was forced to affirm a policy of \nnational defence and non-expansionist war aims, and Milyukov and \nGuchkov were obliged to resign. For the Bolsheviks, the 'April crisis' had profound \nconsequences. Those Bolshevik activists who had wavered between \nLenin and Kamenev were having their minds made up by the proof \nthat the Provisional Government was to be given neither conditional \nsupport nor even conditional trust. Little could now save Kamenev \nfrom defeat at the All-Russian Bolshevik Conference. \nTHE SEVENTH ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCE \nYet no victory was going to fall into Lenin's lap unless he handled his \nConference imaginatively. Previous Conferences of Bolsheviks were held \nin Finland or in the emigration. But the April Conference's prime importance lay in its \nploughing up of the virgin soil of the politics of Russia. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. \nOne hundred and fifty-two delegates attended, from nearly all \nmajor organisations associated with the Bolsheviks. 53 Such a \nstep confirmed that the party had a European viewpoint on the scope \nof its tasks and that Lenin was regarded as inferior in status to no \nEuropean socialist leader. His esteem among Bolsheviks had reached \nits highest point yet. Bubnov from the \nBolsheviks' Moscow Regional Bureau, who wanted clauses inserted \non the need to 'control' the Provisional Government since it had \nbecome 'counterrevolutionary'. 54 Bubnov was on the party's left; and \nhe, no less than Lenin, sought the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment. Lenin reaffirmed that \n'lengthy work' was needed to persuade workers and peasants to \nfollow the Bolsheviks; and he acknowledged that it was still unclear \nhow successful the party would be with the peasantry. He queried, too, the basis in \nMarxist thought for a socialist administration involving not only 'the \nproletariat' but also the peasantry.60 And what, \nenquired Kamenev, did Lenin offer to the party to fight for in the \nperiod before the transfer of power to socialists. By scrapping the \ntwo-stage revolutionary schedule, Lenin had left no short-term \nreforms to be aimed at. Kuraev, a sympathiser with Lenin, \ncomplained about the absence of 'a sketch of the steps to be taken \ntowards socialist revolution in The April Theses.65 Bolsheviks since 1905 had urged \nthat only mass socialist organisations could ensure the establishment \nof a truly democratic order in Russia, so that Kamenev's call for a \ntransfer of governmental authority was not entirely unexpected. Kamenev almost \ntheatrically welcomed the Central Committee's ban on insurrection-\n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nary slogans. 70 Lenin and he could at any rate agree on several \npracticalities while clashing over underlying strategy and Marxist \ndefinitions. Perhaps he \nfound Bubnov's formulation to be too reminiscent of Trotski (who as \nyet remained a figure of suspicion among Bolsheviks). It neatly balanced Lenin and Zinoviev on \none side with Kamenev and Nogin on the other; Bubnov had earned \na place by his interventions; and Stalin (who had edged away from \nKamenev to occupy an intermediate position in the debate) and I. On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F. Dzierzynski, the Polish social-democratic leftist who had \nnow joined the Bolsheviks, argued against Nogin that the peace \nconference would be a sham since British and French socialists would \nnot be participating. The Lenin-Kamenev line carried the day. 76 \nThe defeated Nogin proceeded to introduce a debate on the party's \nrelation to the soviets.'77 \nAt the sixth session of the Conference, on 27 April, Lenin \nintroduced a motion on the war. The crux of his remarks was that \nthe Bolsheviks, on coming to power, should 'openly propose a \n There Is Such a Party.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' .80 Be that as it may, \nLenin's motion was passed nem. His proposed \nclauses were basically the same as those of the Petrograd City \nConference: he saw the soviets and other mass organisations as the \nlikely organs of revolutionary governmental authority. Yet he \nnodded gently in the direction of the Bolshevik right wing, saying \nthat the Constituent Assembly might embody the new power. But this was too much for Lenin and Zinoviev, and \nZinoviev spoke against. \nLenin had successfully revived his land nationalisation scheme of \n1905. The second was that he commented that land \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnationalisation would 'ineluctably give a push towards wider \nmeasures'. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. \nAngarski from Moscow, questioned Lenin's arguments at all. At least two \nother Bolshevik leaders, Iosif Stalin and M. In fact, Angarski was right in his judgement; but the \nConference, by a majority, did not think so and Lenin's ideas became \nofficial party policy. 89 \nThis drastic reversal of the defeats sustained at the hands of his \nown Bolsheviks in 1905-7 was accomplished with little discussion. So was \nLenin's on the need to start work on the writing of a new party \nprogramme. Fedorov, member of the \nPetersburg City Committee (which refused to change its name to the \nPetrograd Committee as a protest against the government's 'chau-\nvinism' in renaming the capital), reported on the progress of the \nPetrograd Soviet debate on the acceptability of a government \ncoalition of liberals and socialists. Shmidt reported on the activities of the Petersburg City \nParty Committee. The proceedings continued with Zinoviev's report \non the need for the Bolsheviks to unite with all social-democrats \nregarded by them as truly internationalist in orientation. \n175 \nInterdistricters were close in strategy to Trotski; and Zinoviev, \ndeliberately or not, was initiating a process which culminated in \nTrotski's entry to the Bolshevik party in July. In accordance with \nthe pre-war writings of Lenin and Stalin, the report stressed the \ndesirability of dissuading non-Russian nationalities from exercising \nthat right. 91 \nBut the Central Committee had chanced its arm by choosing \nStalin. Unhappiness with Lenin's attitude to the national question \nhad long been widespread among Bolsheviks, and the section \nestablished by the Conference to formulate a motion refused to \ngive approval to Stalin's viewpoint. Pyatakov;92 and Pyatakov, Lenin's opponent on \nthe national question, was not minded to give way to Stalin.93 Lenin's ripost was his \nmost passionate contribution to the Conference: 'There's no people \nwhich could be so pervaded by hatred to Russia, there's no people \nwhich could so terribly not love Russia as the Poles. Lenin professed a readiness to contemplate the \nsecession of the Ukrainians as well as the Poles and the Finns; but \nhe predicted that the Ukraine would in the event be content with a \n'fraternal union' with Russia.95 Stalin's final speech dwelt on the \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nusefulness of the national liberation movement as a 'bridge' between \nEast and West.97 There had been \nresistance to Kamenev's standing when the candidatures had been \ndiscussed in closed session because of his behaviour in the Bolshevik \ncourt case of 1915, but Lenin came to his rescue, arguing the need to \nlet bygones be bygones98. Evidently he felt that there was enough \ncommon ground between himself and the leader of the Bolshevik \nright to keep him in the Central Committee; and perhaps he already \nvalued him as a potential counterweight to leftists who might want to \nforce the revolutionary pace even faster than Lenin himself wanted.99 But Lenin and Zinoviev did not get things all \ntheir own way. Stasova, whom Lenin wanted to run the Central Committee \nSecretariat; she was dropped in favour of Y. Sverdlov, whom \nLenin neither knew much about nor wanted in the Central \nCommittee. 101 \nNone of Lenin's colleagues were his stooges, and several were \nhostile to his general strategy. Furthermore, virtually the entire \nCentral Committee would be based in Petrograd. So Lenin would not be able \nto push through his decisions because his colleagues were under \narrest or dispersed in various countries. Even Zinoviev was willing to \ntake him on, urging the Conference to dispatch a representative to \nthe socialist peace conference in Stockholm in order to increase \nBolshevik influence over the European socialist left. Lenin disagreed; \nbut the Conference backed Zinoviev. 102 Lenin, however, could feel \nsatisfied. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. \nAGAINST DUAL POWER \nThe Bolshevik All-Russian Conference's resolution forbidding social-\nists to enter the Provisional Government was passed in a week when \nLvov was negotiating for Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries to \njoin his cabinet. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. 105 In Petrograd, the \nVyborg District Soviet was solidly hostile to the cabinet after the \nFebruary Revolution. Most soviets, especially at the city level, \nremained in the hands of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries. But the lower the level, the stronger the representation of the \nBolsheviks. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' .106 \nBolsheviks concluded that it was only a matter of time and \npolitical effort, before the Petrograd Soviet fell to them, and those \namong them who still hankered after a united Russian Social-\n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDemocratic Labour Party with the Mensheviks diminished. The \nliaison between the Kadet party and the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries strengthened Bolshevik intransigence. Tereshchenko, control of the Foreign Ministry. This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. For Lenin, it \nwas the heyday of his public appearances. He spoke at the First All-\nRussian Congress of Peasants' Deputies and the First Petrograd City \nConference of Factory-Workshop Committees in May, and at the \nFirst All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies in June. 110 \nBolshevik Central Committee policies were modified for popular \nconsumption. Less was said at open mass meetings, in soviet sessions \nor in Pravda about aspects of their plans which jarred against the \ninclinations of workers, peasants and soldiers. The Central Commit-\ntee simplified the April Party Conference's resolutions, which were \nphrased in terms impervious to most non-Marxists, and indeed many \nBolsheviks. The incentive came with the need to set out a list of the \nparty's demands and slogans for the forthcoming election of deputies \nto the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin sketched a draft calling for 'no \nsupport' for the Provisional Government and for an end to the war \nwithout annexations and indemnities and with full self-determination \nfor all peoples. 112 Both Lenin and the \nCentral Committee, moreover, avoided mention of the possibility of \n'revolutionary war' or 'European civil war'. These topics continued \nto be addressed among Bolshevik leaders through 1917; but there was \na recognition that such talk would not gain universal approval on the \nstreets. 113 \nHow much pressure was exerted on Lenin by Central Committee \ncolleagues to mollify and fudge his policies is not known. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. 114 Lenin's incomplete draft did not state how the party should \ncampaign at the local level. 115 Before 1917 his policies had been aimed more at \ngetting support in his party than at communicating with Russian \nsociety; he had seldom worried lest his provocative declarations \nmight prove unacceptable to workers and peasants. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. The scheme for an armed march of protest against \nthe Provisional Government, coinciding with the convocation of the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, was \ninstigated by members of the Bolshevik Military Organisation. \nLenin, without being in constant touch with the Military Organisa-\ntion, had a host of admirers among its leading cadre. 116 The Military \nOrganisation was formally subject to the Central Committee and was \nempowered to co-ordinate party activity and party groups through \nthe Russian armed forces. Its radicalism and willingness to take the \ninitiative were already well known, and several of its members felt \nthat the Central Committee's response to the April crisis over \nMilyukov had been insufficiently revolutionary. Thus their radical-\nism overspilled the bounds respected by Lenin himself since the All-\nRussian April Conference of the Bolshevik party. A mass display of \nstrength at the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies, in their view, would gain further support for the \nparty and possibly shake the position of the government itself; it \nmight even prevent the expected resumption of an offensive on the \nEastern front. \n181 \nThis was the nearest any Bolshevik had come since the February \nRevolution to stating how the Provisional Government might be \noverthrown. The arguments for and against a demonstration were \nstill being debated in the various party committees in the capital \nwhen the Congress of Soviets began on 3 June. The Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries held their expected majority; only lOS out \nof 777 were Bolsheviks. It was the high point of the anti-\nBolshevik socialist movement in Russia; and the alliance of Men-\nsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries easily dominated the Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets which was elected to \nassume the functions of national soviet leadership. \nOn the second day, 4 June, Lenin was given the chance to reply on \nbehalf of the Bolsheviks. His speech, which was limited to fifteen \nminutes by the rules of the Congress, restated his party's well-known \nline on the Provisional Government and on the transfer of power to \nthe soviets. He sneered that 'the \ncitizen Minister of Posts and Telegraphs' had declared there was no \npolitical party in Russia which would express its readiness to take \npower entirely into its own hands. Lenin exclaimed: 'I reply: \"There \nis. But it was \napparent that the Bolsheviks lacked the support in the country for \nany attempt at the formation of a government. The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. Not even many Bolshevik \ndelegates to the Congress knewY0 A joint meeting of the Central \nCommittee, Military Organisation and the Petersburg Committee's \nExecutive Commission took place on 6 June while the Congress was \nin session; and, behind closed doors, the case for a demonstration \nwas offered by Military Organisation leader N. 121 \nLenin concurred, but the right-wingers in the Central Committee \nspoke against. A clash between Lenin and \nNogin ensued; and Nogin vehemently expostulated: 'Lenin is \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposing a revolution.' 122 But Lenin ignored Nogin's interpretation of his inten-\ntions. It would indeed seem that Lenin was aspiring not to the \ninstallation of a Bolshevik government but rather a transfer of power \nto the soviets, which would have resulted in a government of \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. 123 \nLenin had most members of the Central Committee with him, and \nnearly all leaders of the Military Organisation and the Petersburg \nCommittee also opposed Kamenev over the next few days. 124 At the \nnext joint meeting, on 8 June, the Central Committee resolved firmly \nin favour of a demonstration, on 10 June, to be planned by the \nMilitary Organisation and the Petersburg Committee. 126 No one \nknows whether Lenin approved of this infringement of the Central \nCommittee's orders. The Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships were worried by the posters \npinned up around Petrograd by Bolshevik activists. The First All-\nRussian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies as a precaution \nbanned the holding of any armed demonstration without the \npermission of the Petrograd Soviet. The scene was set for the first \ntest of strength between the Bolsheviks and the Provisional Govern-\nment.127 \nLenin panicked. Five members were able to attend despite the short \nnotice: Kamenev, Lenin, Nogin, Sverdlov and Zinoviev. \nOutvoted, Lenin and Sverdlov abstained. Party \ncomrades were dispatched to give instructions to the Military \nOrganisation and the Petersburg Committee. 129 \nThe worry for Lenin was the attitude which might be taken by the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. \nTsereteli objected to Lenin's casual temerity in initiating the \ndemonstration and treated his activity as part of a conspiracy to \nset up a Bolshevik government. 130 The Central Committee had, in \nfact, wanted power transferred to 'the soviets'; and, if this had \noccurred, Tsereteli would have been a strong candidate for the \npremiership. His \nvehemence, moreover, was opposed even by several non-Bolsheviks. \nMartov spoke against the proposal for the Bolsheviks to be \nphysically disarmed. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. 131 The result, on 12 June, was that \nthe Bolsheviks were merely censured for recklessness. 132 Not even \nTsereteli had much stomach for the repressive measures that Lenin \nand Trotski would have applied to them in similar circumstances. The Bolsheviks \nparticipated in the demonstration with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries even though there were frictions over the \nBolshevik party's insistence on marching under its own slogans, \nincluding 'All Power To The Soviets'. 133 \nA LEADER ON CAMPAIGN \nDoubts about Lenin's mettle as a revolutionary leader were \nsurfacing. The Petersburg Committee, convening on 11 June, was \nirritated by the fumbling and bungling of the Central Committee. \nThe displeasure was intense since it was the Petersburg Committee's \nactivists and not Lenin who had the uncongenial task of dissuading \nagitated crowds of anti-governmental workers, soldiers and sailors \n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom undertaking a demonstration which the Central Committee had \nencouraged. Nearly all participants in the debate in the Petersburg \nCommittee criticised Lenin's leadership directly or by implication. 134 \nHe survived their anger mainly because no Bolshevik figure on the \nparty's left offered himself as an alternative leader and because he \nhandled his defence with firmness and discretion. 135 \nHe was helped by his status as the whipping boy of the anti-\nBolshevik press. Lenin had become one of a handful of politicians \nknown by name to everyone in the country interested in politics. Most onlookers found the similarities rather \nthan the differences between the Kadets and the non-Bolshevik \nsocialists most impressive. Lenin and his party, by contrast, opposed \nthe entire historic compromise between Russian liberalism and \nRussian 'moderate' socialism; and the barrage of invective fired at \nhim in national newspapers served to enhance his eminence. 137 The net effect of \nthe vilification, at least until early July, was to disseminate the \nproposals of the Bolsheviks more widely. 138 \nLenin and his associates, however, were perturbed by the smear \ncampaign. The party in the provinces expressed its concern, and \nrequests were made to the Central Committee to counter the anti-\nBolshevik tirades by publishing information on the real Lenin, his \nbackground and personality. Lenin began a sketch of his life. 142 Bolsheviks were evidently not \nintending to establish a 'cult' around him. They recognised Lenin \nas their party chief with fewer reservations than the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had about Viktor Chernov or even the Kadets \nabout Pavel Milyukov; 143 but they held back from adulation. The \n'heartfelt greetings' sent by a 7000-strong meeting of workers in \nBogorodsko-Glukhovo to 'the respected fighter and leader of the \nworking class, comrade Lenin' was more the exception than the \nnorm, 144 and Lenin did not pursue exceptional treatment for himself. But even if this is what he was \ndoing, it may well have stemmed from Lenin's instincts rather than \nhis conscious choice: his was not a self-inquiring mind. \nAnd so, whereas the rest of the press presented him as an \nindividual politician capable of bringing down the Provisional \nGovernment, Lenin as ever did not emphasise the word 'I' and \npreferred phrases like 'we, the workers'. 146 He did not lose this combativeness, but \nincreasingly he looked more like a working-class Bolshevik than a \nmiddle-class pedagogue; he obviously found the revolutionary \nenvironment congenial. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHe proved adept too at mass oratory. \nBesides Central Committee sessions and local party occasions in \nPetrograd, Lenin had to address eleven large gatherings. Lenin suggested that \nwhatever deprivations needed to be made would be paid for by the \nenemies of the working class. 149 \nThis message, with its combination of invocation and reassurance, \nmust have contributed to Lenin's advance on power. He knew about the provincial political \nprocesses only from newspapers and from Bolshevik activists coming \nto Petrograd for meetings, conferences and congresses \nThis also meant that direct knowledge of Lenin the man was \nthinly-spread in the rest of the country. This was not, at least not yet, the Bolshevik \nparty's style. Bolsheviks printed most pictures of their leaders later in \nthe year, after they had seized power. \nConsequently Lenin's impact upon general politics in Russia \nstemmed in large measure from his newspaper articles. The year \n1917 was the golden age of Russian print journalism, and Lenin \ndevoted more hours per day to writing for Pravda- he wrote little for \nother Bolshevik outlets- than to any other political function. Only the villages, which had hardly any Bolshevik party \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngroups, were left outside the normal distribution network. Even so, it must be added that nearly \nhalf the copies were sold in Petro grad and that therefore not even all \nliterate Bolshevik rank-and-filers can have read the words of their \nparty leader). To be sure, he was still not writing in expectation \nof being read by the entire literate working class; but he did at least \nhope to reach out to all members of his party: and three fifths of \nthese in 1917, it is reckoned, were labourers of some sort. 157 \nLenin was Pravda's regular columnist on current political issues; \nand in this role he especially aimed to acquire the support of \nBolshevik committee-men in Petrograd and the localities for his \nstrategy. \nAnd Lenin, like his Central Committee colleagues, carried a heavy \nload of responsibilities on the Bolshevik party's behalf. Lenin and Krupskaya were relieved of the \nbusiness of correspondence with local party committees. Moreover, it was Kamenev's \nmain job to direct the Bolshevik fraction in the Petrograd Soviet \n(whereas Lenin, the great advocate of 'all power to the soviets' in the \n There Is Such a Party. \n189 \nspring, was not elected to the Soviet). Nogin, at his own \ninsistence, worked in the Moscow Soviet. Sverdlov ran the Central Committee Secretariat with a \nsmall but efficient staff and, like Stalin, was among the less 'visible' \nfigures in the Bolshevik leadership. 163 Despite Lenin's doubts about \nhim at the April Bolshevik Conference, Sverdlov could hardly have \nbeen closer to Lenin's policies, and his indefatigable service to the \nCentral Committee and its Secretariat freed Lenin to focus on his \nchosen activities. Zinoviev, too, was emerging as a figure of substance \non the Bolshevik right. In order to strengthen his hand, Lenin looked \noutside the party in search of prominent Marxists opposed to the \nProvisional Government. A similar mixture of rancour and \npolitical calculation held back leading anti-Lenin Bolsheviks from \nthe pre-war period, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov. They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. \nLenin apparently did not have all the Central Committee on his side \nin opening negotiations even though the April Party Conference had \ngiven its approval. A Pravda editorial, in a curious hint about his \nproblem, reported that the invitation had been made 'in the name of \ncomrade Lenin and several Central Committee members' . Even before the February Revolution, as Lenin \nand Zinoviev noted, he had denounced Chkheidze and the Men-\nshevik Duma deputies; 168 and, upon his return to Russia, he agreed \nwith the Bolsheviks that a rupture was desirable with the Menshevik \nleaders who condoned the coalition with the Kadets. He felt that \nLenin, whether he said so or not, had embraced the Trotskyist theory \nof 'permanent revolution' in place of the traditional two-stage \nrevolutionary schedule; and indeed, after joining the Bolsheviks, \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski defended his strategy of 1905-6 with enthusiasm in Bolshevik \npublications. 169 He was not constrained to defer to Lenin, who \nwelcomed Trotski's adhesion to the Bolsheviks not only since he was \nan increasingly needed advocate of radicalism but also because of his \ntechnical and oratorical skills; and he was asked to help with the \nediting of 'a popular organ'; 170 No Bolshevik leader could match his \nrecord in this respect. The development of Lenin as a chairman of \nBolshevik opinion and as a leader who could coax unlikely partners \nto co-operate had begun. \nTHE JULY DAYS \nThe First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies elected a permanent body to co-ordinate soviet affairs \nacross the country. This was the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee (or VTsiK), and its leading members were Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries as well as some Bundists. All were members of the Petrograd \nSoviet, whose importance declined at the national level. Bolsheviks, \nunder Kamenev's leadership, constituted a minority on the All-\nRussian Central Executive Committee. \nThese Bolsheviks could barely believe that the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee, which had relations with virtually all soviets in \ncities and on the Eastern front, refused to take power from the \nKadets. Not surprisingly, Lenin found it difficult to strike the balance \nbetween enunciating a radical strategy and restraining his adherents \nfrom its premature application. 176 The conference fell into heated \ndebate, and only with difficulty did the demand of Lenin and the \nCentral Committee prevail. 177 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Petersburg Committee was also in session on 20 June. And yet it was precisely \nnow, on 29 June, that Lenin felt able to take a rest for a few days in \nNeivola, a village in the Finnish countryside some four or five hours \ndistant from Petrograd by local train. 181 In midsummer 1917 the political stakes were much \nhigher, and yet Lenin unconcernedly departed to stay in Vladimir \nBonch-Bruevich's rural dacha. 182 Unintentionally, this leader, who \nthought no one equalled his competence in dealing with affairs at the \napex of the Bolshevik party, was leaving the Central Committee to \nface alone the party's most fiendishly difficult test since the February \nRevolution. Low-level Bolshevik activists were involved. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. 185 Bolsheviks in the \nparty's lower echelons did little to restrain the crowds; some of them \nactively fomented trouble. When the news reached the Petrograd \nBolshevik City Conference, the delegates ignored the Central \nCommittee's prohibition and offered to lead the demonstration 'if \nthis proved necessary'. \nBut they would not budge, to the delight of a Bolshevik All-Russian \nBureau of Military Organisations which announced its readiness to \nguide the demonstration. But the \nBolshevik leadership, in the Petersburg Committee and in the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisations, were following rather \nthan guiding events; and, although most participants hoped that the \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nturmoil would somehow result in the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment, they had no definite set of tactics. \nThe All-Russian Bureau of Military Organisations took operational \ncommand. The worry \npersisted that the outcome would not be happy, and the Bolshevik \ncentral leaders wanted to take as few obviously incriminating steps as \npossible. Stalin was instructed to draft a \nleaflet in the early hours of the morning of 4 July calling for a \ntransfer of power to the soviets. 193 Lenin and his companions, \nBonch-Bruevich and his sister Mariya dressed hurriedly. They made for the \nKshesinskaya palace to seek out the Bolshevik leaders. Sverdlov and \nAnatoli Lunacharski addressed them from the balcony; and Lenin, \nwho had in the meantime arrived, was asked to come out to say a few \nwords. Kalinin, who \nhad no warmer desire than Lenin for a demonstration, was to recall \nthat Lenin nevertheless spoke with his fellow leaders as if he was still \nnot completely convinced that the march would be a fiasco and that \nthe Provisional Government would not fail. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. The \nleft wing of the Menshevik party was led by Martov, who had \nreturned in May but who until early July was not willing to endorse a \ntransfer of power to the soviets. The \nBolshevik Central Committee called on the crowds to leave the \nstreets.200 \nWhen Lenin was faced with the angry disappointment of the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisation's leaders, he responded \nwith a barrage of detailed, operational questions as to what forces \ncould be deployed if the demonstration was to be revived. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. \nLenin declared that the revolutionary process was entering a critical \nphase. The Bolshevik \nparty needed to make tactical adjustments to survive and flourish \nagain.204 \nESCAPE TO THE LAKES \nAnti-Bolshevik repression had ensued in Petrograd. The deaths of \ndemonstrators ran into the hundreds, and there were many reports of \nviolence being meted out to known or suspected Bolsheviks \nencountered on the streets. Lenin, Kamenev and Zinoviev headed the \nlist of those hunted by the authorities. \nTrotski and Lunacharski, despite not belonging to the Bolshevik \nparty, had been involved in negotiations about the demonstration; \nthey too were sought by troops loyal to the Provisional Govern-\nment. The exceptions were Lenin and Zinoviev. As regards Zinoviev, \nhe retained a reputation as a radical Bolshevik but was by now closer \nto Kamenev than to Lenin, and had opposed the demonstration from \nits conception. They had consistently \nrepudiated the accusation, taking space in Bolshevik newspapers to \nexplain their story and to stress that they would have returned via \nFrance and the North Sea if only the Allied authorities had given \npermission. \n197 \nBurtsev had spent a career exposing police agents in the Russian \nrevolutionary movement; Aleksinski was a former Bolshevik whose \nhostility to Lenin had induced him to found a newspaper, Without \nSuperfluous Words, dedicated wholly to the exposure of Bolshevik \nmisdeeds. 207 \nEven so, Lenin and Zinoviev initially thought to deliver themselves \nup to the authorities on condition that the Petrograd Soviet would \nguarantee physical protection and a fair trial. 208 Several Bolsheviks \nadvised this. The additional consideration was that all revolutionary parties, \nincluding the Bolsheviks, assumed that no single leader's fate should \nbe put before the good of the party and the Revolution. \nAbruptly, on 8 July, Lenin and Zinoviev had second thoughts and \ndecided to avoid arrest. 211 \nBy then, however, several newspapers were baying for Lenin's blood. \nGruesome cartoons depicted Lenin on a scaffold.212 But Bolshevik \ncalls for him to surrender himself to the authorities subsided, and \nLenin and Zinoviev went into hiding in the capital.214 For \nthe next month they stayed with the Bolshevik and factory worker \nNikolai Emelyanov, who had, like many Russian workers, retained a \nhouse and some land in the countryside. Lenin and Zinoviev slept in \nthe barn-loft. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe two men felt able to stroll around so long as they took \nreasonable care, but scares sometimes happened. On one occasion \nthe sight of approaching armed men caused Lenin and Zinoviev to \ndive into a haystack. The Provisional Government's repressive zeal was fading \nsomewhat, and Lenin and Zinoviev received secret visits from \nBolshevik Central Committee members. 217 From 23 July 1917 \nPravda's position as the central party organ was transferred by the \nCentral Committee to the Military Organisation's Worker and \nSoldier (which was the new name for Soldier's Pravda). 218 By 26 \nJuly, Lenin's articles were appearing in it.'220 \nYet Lenin and Zinoviev felt insecure even near Sestroretsk. Tsereteli also resigned, deciding to \nconcentrate on the business of the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets. A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN. The Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries were the majority in the cabinet, but \nthe policies remained largely unchanged except that nobody any \nlonger contemplated the resumption of an offensive of the Eastern \nfront. For Kerenski, Lenin was only the tip of \n There Is Such a Party. The question of law and order in \nPetrograd and other cities lay under the surface; and frequent \ndiscussions were held between the new premier and General Lavr \nKornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of Russian armed forces, in \npursuit of a solution. The Bolshevik party had a warm relationship with. \nSuccessful overtures were made on Lenin's behalf to obtain \nsanctuary in Finland proper. \nLenin prepared himself for the journey to Finland with his \ncustomary attention to detail. This time Lenin \nmasqueraded as an engine stoker.226 Lenin pressed on \nwith his research for The State and Revolution, and continued to \nsubmit articles to the Bolshevik central newspapers and to write to \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee. 227 \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Finns made Lenin's contacts with the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee easier than they had been in Razliv. Nor did he expect the existing chance of a \nBolshevik assumption of power to recur: it was now or never. \n 7 The Fire Next Time: \nJuly to September 1917 \nCONSIDERATIONS ON PARTY STRATEGY \nThe internal life of parties in revolutionary Russia ran on the basis of \npersuasion and consent. The Bolsheviks were feared for their \ndiscipline and hierarchy; and yet their party was, by the standards \nof its own rulebook, highly ill-disciplined.tensions affected relations at all \nlevels of the Bolshevik party's formal hierarchy. Thus the Bolsheviks \nwere not so unlike the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as \nlater mythology contended; 1 and the fact that the Bolshevik party \nwas ill co-ordinated allowed its local activists to react dynamically to \nthe particularity of local events. The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. Being \ninnocent of the co-responsibility for the Provisional Government \nwhich affected their rivals, Bolsheviks could organise their political \ncampaign unfettered. The disagreements among the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries led instead to factionalism; both had left \nwings which wanted to break with the Kadets entirely: and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries were to split into two separate parties in \nNovember 1917. In these conditions it was natural for dissentient \nleftists at lower levels to leave and join the Bolsheviks. Lenin aimed to introduce \nboth clarity and determination. On 10 July 1917, already on the run, \nhe penned, 'The Political Situation (Four Theses)' for submission to \n201 \n.", "Sowed_And_Cultivated_1917": " In 1917 they argued that the \nland could not be handed over to the peasants without disrupting \nagriculture in the short term, diminishing the supply of food to the \ntowns and tempting soldiers to desert and return to their native \nvillages. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. \n191 \nestates rose in number from June 1917.

From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution.55 \nHis own proposed administration would be a socialist 'state of the \nParis Commune type'; but it would also be a 'dictatorship' which did \nnot rely on 'the formal will of the majority'. He queried, too, the basis in \nMarxist thought for a socialist administration involving not only 'the \nproletariat' but also the peasantry.65 Bolsheviks since 1905 had urged \nthat only mass socialist organisations could ensure the establishment \nof a truly democratic order in Russia, so that Kamenev's call for a \ntransfer of governmental authority was not entirely unexpected. On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' .84 He did not present it as a socialist measure \nbut as a means for removing the feudal obstacles to agricultural \nmodernisation within a capitalist economic framework. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. At least two \nother Bolshevik leaders, Iosif Stalin and M. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. But the lower the level, the stronger the representation of the \nBolsheviks. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' . The \nliaison between the Kadet party and the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries strengthened Bolshevik intransigence. 109 \nBut the liberals had the consolation that the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries still wanted them to govern, and that \nKerenski in particular, as Minister of Army and Navy Affairs, had \nmoved closer to their viewpoint; they also retained, in the person of \nM. Tereshchenko, control of the Foreign Ministry. This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. 110 \nBolshevik Central Committee policies were modified for popular \nconsumption. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. 115 Before 1917 his policies had been aimed more at \ngetting support in his party than at communicating with Russian \nsociety; he had seldom worried lest his provocative declarations \nmight prove unacceptable to workers and peasants. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. It was the high point of the anti-\nBolshevik socialist movement in Russia; and the alliance of Men-\nsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries easily dominated the Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets which was elected to \nassume the functions of national soviet leadership. The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. \nOutvoted, Lenin and Sverdlov abstained. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. He appeared as the personification of the project for \nsocialist revolution.

A similar mixture of rancour and \npolitical calculation held back leading anti-Lenin Bolsheviks from \nthe pre-war period, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov. They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. The development of Lenin as a chairman of \nBolshevik opinion and as a leader who could coax unlikely partners \nto co-operate had begun. This was the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee (or VTsiK), and its leading members were Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries as well as some Bundists. 177 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Petersburg Committee was also in session on 20 June. Low-level Bolshevik activists were involved. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. But the \nBolshevik leadership, in the Petersburg Committee and in the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisations, were following rather \nthan guiding events; and, although most participants hoped that the \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nturmoil would somehow result in the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment, they had no definite set of tactics. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized.

The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. The disagreements among the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries led instead to factionalism; both had left \nwings which wanted to break with the Kadets entirely: and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries were to split into two separate parties in \nNovember 1917. 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee. Kerenski's cabinet, he declared, constituted \n'a military dictatorship'; and the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leadership had become 'the fig-leaf of the counter-revolu-\ntion'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.', according to Ordzhoni-\nkidze's later account, Lenin let it be known that the factory-\nworkshop c9mmittees could provide the institutional base for the \nforthcoming socialist administration.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination.14 Yet he affirmed that the ultimate objective remained the same: \nnamely to establish a socialist administration of soviets.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. He looked forward also to socialist revolution \nin the West. He mentioned that 'certain comrades' still believed \ni~ to be 'utopian to raise the ,question of socialist revolution' in \nRussia. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed. \nDzhaparidze for ignoring the prospect of socialist revolution in the \n 1.

'52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential. Preobrazhenski wanted to \nspecify that the movement towards socialism in Russia was \ndependent on 'proletarian revolution in the West'. Stalin's later advocacy of 'socialism in one country' was being \nbroached in a sketchy manner even before the October Revolution. Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. The fate \nof both the cabinet and the soviets hung in the balance. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. Martov and the \nMenshevik-lnternationalists and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nhad already moved towards accepting the need for an exclusively \nsocialist government to be formed. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. He was also a \ntheorist, and wanted to put down a general statement on the nature \nof socialist revolution. The State and \nRevolution was the most refined embodiment of Lenin's strategy for \nthe carrying through of a socialist transformation in modern \nindustrial societies. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. Lenin's answer was \nthat modern capitalism had simplified the functions of administra-\ntion. As every citizen became involved in \npublic affairs, so the dawn of communism would draw nearer. The ultimate Marxist \nobjective was a state-free society; but Lenin maintained that the \ntransition from capitalism to communism required an intermediate \nstage of socialism which would be inaugurated by the formation of a \nsocialist state: the dictatorship of the proletariat. For Lenin, this had come to demonstrate \nKautsky's lack of understanding that a socialist political order would \nbe based on the model of the Paris Commune and would dispense \naltogether with the need for a 'bureaucracy'.118 This was a reference to the absence of a description of the \n'dictatorship of the proletariat' in general and the soviets in \nparticular. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. \nIt is not sensible to assume, as Lenin did, that administrators can \nbe prevented from forming themselves into a corporate group (or \ninto groups) simply by insisting on electivity, on the right of instant \nrecall and on payment at a worker's rate. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. 179 Being a Marxist rather than a populist, Lenin had a \nfirmer trust in the capacities of the workers and was not going to \nhand over the forthcoming socialist revolution to the peasants. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more.201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine.206 Lenin railed against \nthe greed and selfishness of businessmen. \nAnother impediment may have been the feeling that, as a party \nleader, he needed to imply that a socialist administration would have \nno difficulties.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 218 \nThis concorded with his more optimistic views on the extent of global \ncapitalist development already achieved and on the speed which \ncould characterise the inception of socialism in Russia as well as in \nEurope in general. In May 1917 he wrote about the \ndesirability of governmental control 'over the trusts, over the \nbanks, over trade, over the \"parasites\" . In 1918 he was to dub it 'state \ncapitalism'; but before the October Revolution he balked at such a \nterm. On the contrary, he thought that, despite what \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries expected, their policy would in effect \npreside over capitalism in the countryside. He wanted power for himself and his party, and he wanted \nthis power to be directed at the eventual attainment of socialism in \nRussia and Europe. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader.", "Bolshevik_Intransigence_1917": " 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir loyalty to their soviets as being primary; troops on the Eastern \nfront increasingly exhibited the same attitude. Soldiers demanded a relaxation of \ndiscipline and the permission to elect their own committees to \nrepresent their interests; and the Petrograd Soviet issued its 'Order \nNo. \nContinuing to think that socialism in backward Russia was a \npremature project and that national unity was essential in wartime, \nthey hoped to constrain the Provisional Government to act within \nthe limits of policies based on democratic political liberties and \nterritorial defence; and, immediately after the February Revolution, \nmost workers, peasants and soldiers felt likewise. Their votes \nprovided the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries with \nmajorities in the soviets. The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917.7 Returning \nto Petrograd, Lenin was adept in expressing popular attitudes which \nhad not yet fully developed.8 \nHis task was facilitated by the often-overlooked fact that even the \nprincipal leaders of the Bolshevik right, Kamenev and Stalin, had \nalready distanced themselves from the policies of contemporary \nMenshevism.9 At the beginning of April, this pair acted as major \nBolshevik spokesmen. It was they who were chosen by the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee to put the Bolshevik case at the \nassembly of soviet deputies, drawn from all over the country, which \nmet in Petrograd from 29 March. Kamenev and Stalin argued for \norganisational links with the Mensheviks (who supplied most \nrepresentatives to the gathering of deputies); they also won over \nthe Bolshevik fraction (or caucus) to the policy of conditional \nsupport for the Provisional Government 'insofar as it follows the \npath of satisfying the demands of the working class and the \nrevolutionary peasantry'. 10 Negotiations between the Bolshevik and \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik fractions proceeded on this basis. Later accounts have \nportrayed these negotiations as yet another case of Kamenev and \nStalin behaving cravenly in Lenin's absence. 11 Obviously, Stalin and \nKamenev were not following Lenin's line. Yet they were not cringing \nbefore Menshevism either: Stalin made clear his belief that the \nProvisional Government's days were numbered and that sooner or \nlater, after 'a break with the bourgeoisie', the soviets would assume \npower; 12 and Kamenev persuaded the Menshevik negotiators to \ncriticise even the Petrograd Soviet's foreign policy, to call for a \npublication of secret treaties and to repudiate the principle of 'civil \npeace' _13 Furthermore, other Bolshevik speakers emphasised the \nnecessity for a radical series of direct-action measures. 14 \nThe tentative agreements between the Bolshevik and Menshevik \nfractions did not hold. 17 This would have excluded Men-\nshevik right-wingers; and, as Stalin must have realised, neither the \nMenshevik centrists nor the Menshevik leftists would have linked up \nwith the Bolsheviks on such terms. \nFor a few days, Tsereteli's ascendancy over Russian socialists \nseemed unshakeable. Tsereteli carried a motion of support for the \nPetrograd Soviet by 325 votes against 57 when the Bolsheviks and the \nMensheviks emerged from their respective fractions to debate at the \nnational conference of soviets; he even persuaded several Bolsheviks \nto the right of Kamenev, such as V. Lenin returned home at the moment \nwhen all Bolsheviks recognised the need for a wide-ranging discus-\nsion to formulate the general line of Bolshevik strategy and to put an \nend to all this fluidity. Kamenev's sympathisers, while not agreeing \nwith Lenin, distrusted the Mensheviks; and the position of the \n There Is Such a Party. \n165 \nBolshevik right was anyway under persistent challenge. The radicals \nin the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee did not cease to \npress for overt opposition to the Provisional Government. Russian \nBureau member V. 19 \nIt was in this unstable situation that Lenin, arriving on 3 April, \ntalked into the night with Bolshevik leaders in the party's head-\nquarters in the Kshesinskaya Palace (which had simply been \nsequestred by force). 20 At noon next day he was accompanied by \nthem to the Tauride Palace where he spoke to about seventy \nBolsheviks and read out his April Theses. Goldenberg, despite being Bolsheviks, spoke \nstrongly against him. Goldenberg, a Bolshevik who was moving over \nto Menshevism, shouted: 'Lenin has now made himself candidate for \none European throne vacant for thirty years: the throne of \nBakunin.'22 Mikhail Bakunin had not only been a founding father \nof anarchism in Russia and Europe in the nineteenth century but had \nalso been engaged in virulent disputes with Marx and Engels. Lenin \nwas not amused. Aleksandr Bogdanov, still more bluntly, called \nLenin's theses 'the ravings of a madman'; and Fyodor Dan called \nthem 'the party's funeral', adding that the 'bourgeois revolution' was \nincomplete. He accused Lenin of overlooking a Marxist \n'class analysis' and of failing to see that not every section of the \nRussian bourgeoisie had an interest in a war for territorial gain.23 \nEven the Bolsheviks at both meetings were stupefied and remained \nas yet unconvinced; apparently, only Aleksandra Kollontai spoke on \nLenin's behalf. Tsereteli asserted: 'However \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nirreconcilable Vladimir Ilich may be, I am convinced we'll be \nreconciled. 28 \nNor, seemingly, did any major local committee immediately come \nover to Lenin's support. 29 Lenin had no choice but to meet and talk \nto as many Bolsheviks as possible. 30 But his words were not \nautomatically accepted by Bolsheviks; the history of Bolshevism \nshowed this, and Lenin himself knew it. Pravda on 9 April carried Lenin's article 'On Dual Power', \nwhich addressed the question about the Provisional Government's \nfate: 'It must be overthrown since it is oligarchical, bourgeois and not \na government of the whole people; it cannot give peace or bread or \nfull freedom. Lenin could not have made it clearer that he was calling \nfor a second revolution. Voitinski and those Bolsheviks \nwho opposed Kamenev's stand against Tsereteli quickly abandoned \nthe Bolsheviks altogether.32 The Bolshevik right wing was severely \nweakened. Furthermore, the Kamenevites who had manipulated \nPravda and buffeted the Russian Bureau in March did not reflect \nthe opinions of all Bolsheviks among lower committees, especially at \nthe district level, in Petrograd. \nThe scheduling of an All-Russian Bolshevik Conference for late \nApril opened windows of opportunity for Lenin. Local Bolshevik \nconferences had to be called and party policies had to be openly \ndebated. Only 15 per cent of Bolshevik delegates to the national \nsoviet conference in Petrograd from 29 March to 2 April were re-\nelected to the Conference which opened three weeks later. Some participants in the early \ngathering were pushed aside by the more prestigious leaders, who \nby then had returned from Siberian exile or, like Lenin, from \nemigration. Not even the \nMoscow Bolsheviks had dispatched representatives. 35 Almost cer-\ntainly the change of composition as between the national gathering \non 29 March and the Bolshevik April Conference also reflected the \nfact that rank-and-file Bolsheviks, when their opinion was consulted, \nchose leaders who approved of radical alternatives to Kamenev's \npolicies. The balance of opinion \namong the Bolsheviks was swinging his way, and The April Theses \naccelerated the process. The \nPetrograd Bolsheviks met on 14 April. 37 \nThis won over Bolsheviks like Prisedko who, in their own account, \nhad originally been frightened off by his ultra-radical talk. His original intention had been to specify that, if a general \npeace without annexations and indemnities could not be brought \nabout, a new socialist administration should fight a 'revolutionary \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwar' against imperialism. Specific objections were voiced, for \nexample, to the notion of a commune-state; evidently not all \nBolsheviks agreed with Lenin's critique of Kautsky's views on the \nstate. Goloshchekin, with a touch of exaggeration, declared: \n'You can sketch in whatever pattern for practical steps you like on \ncomrade Lenin's theses.44 \nHow representative were the Petrograd Bolsheviks in their move-\nment towards The April Theses is not yet known with precision; but, \nvery probably, party committees elsewhere in the country inclined in \nLenin's favour for similarly mixed motives, and not all of these \nimplied total submission to Lenin's will.45 Nor, of course, did the \nBolsheviks debate strategy in a political vacuum.46 Workers and soldiers, as all Bolsheviks \nwere aware, were still busily extending their rights; and already there \nwere signs that wage settlements would not keep pace with inflation.47 In such circumstances it was \nhard for Kamenev to win over the Bolsheviks with ideas of even \nconditional support for the Provisional Government. \nAnd yet it was probably a certain development in international \nrelations which improved Lenin's chances most of all. Mensheviks, Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries and Bolsheviks took to the streets in protest on 20 April; \nand, in view of the precedent whereby the monarchy had been \nbrought low by largely peaceful crowds of demonstrators, the Lvov \ncabinet was severely shaken.48 The Bolshevik Central Committee, at \nLenin's instigation, had encouraged the protest demonstration and \nsuggested that only a seizure of power by 'the revolutionary \nproletariat together with the revolutionary soldiers' could bring \nabout 'a truly democratic peace' . For the Bolsheviks, the 'April crisis' had profound \nconsequences. Those Bolshevik activists who had wavered between \nLenin and Kamenev were having their minds made up by the proof \nthat the Provisional Government was to be given neither conditional \nsupport nor even conditional trust. Little could now save Kamenev \nfrom defeat at the All-Russian Bolshevik Conference. Previous Conferences of Bolsheviks were held \nin Finland or in the emigration. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. \nOne hundred and fifty-two delegates attended, from nearly all \nmajor organisations associated with the Bolsheviks. 53 Such a \nstep confirmed that the party had a European viewpoint on the scope \nof its tasks and that Lenin was regarded as inferior in status to no \nEuropean socialist leader. His esteem among Bolsheviks had reached \nits highest point yet. Bubnov from the \nBolsheviks' Moscow Regional Bureau, who wanted clauses inserted \non the need to 'control' the Provisional Government since it had \nbecome 'counterrevolutionary'. Lenin reaffirmed that \n'lengthy work' was needed to persuade workers and peasants to \nfollow the Bolsheviks; and he acknowledged that it was still unclear \nhow successful the party would be with the peasantry.60 And what, \nenquired Kamenev, did Lenin offer to the party to fight for in the \nperiod before the transfer of power to socialists. Kuraev, a sympathiser with Lenin, \ncomplained about the absence of 'a sketch of the steps to be taken \ntowards socialist revolution in The April Theses.65 Bolsheviks since 1905 had urged \nthat only mass socialist organisations could ensure the establishment \nof a truly democratic order in Russia, so that Kamenev's call for a \ntransfer of governmental authority was not entirely unexpected.66 \nBut Kamenev also made an announcement on Lenin's motion on the \nwar: 'In general I agree with it.67 In conclusion \nhe even described Lenin's ideas as 'a magnificent programme of \ndevelopment of the revolution'. 70 Lenin and he could at any rate agree on several \npracticalities while clashing over underlying strategy and Marxist \ndefinitions. Perhaps he \nfound Bubnov's formulation to be too reminiscent of Trotski (who as \nyet remained a figure of suspicion among Bolsheviks). On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F. Dzierzynski, the Polish social-democratic leftist who had \nnow joined the Bolsheviks, argued against Nogin that the peace \nconference would be a sham since British and French socialists would \nnot be participating. The Lenin-Kamenev line carried the day. 76 \nThe defeated Nogin proceeded to introduce a debate on the party's \nrelation to the soviets. \nThis provoked Lenin to remark that Petrograd and Moscow were \nnow lagging behind the provinces in revolutionary achievement. The crux of his remarks was that \nthe Bolsheviks, on coming to power, should 'openly propose a \n There Is Such a Party.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' .80 Be that as it may, \nLenin's motion was passed nem. Yet he \nnodded gently in the direction of the Bolshevik right wing, saying \nthat the Constituent Assembly might embody the new power. The second was that he commented that land \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnationalisation would 'ineluctably give a push towards wider \nmeasures'. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration. \nAngarski from Moscow, questioned Lenin's arguments at all. At least two \nother Bolshevik leaders, Iosif Stalin and M. 89 \nThis drastic reversal of the defeats sustained at the hands of his \nown Bolsheviks in 1905-7 was accomplished with little discussion. So was \nLenin's on the need to start work on the writing of a new party \nprogramme. Fedorov, member of the \nPetersburg City Committee (which refused to change its name to the \nPetrograd Committee as a protest against the government's 'chau-\nvinism' in renaming the capital), reported on the progress of the \nPetrograd Soviet debate on the acceptability of a government \ncoalition of liberals and socialists. The proceedings continued with Zinoviev's report \non the need for the Bolsheviks to unite with all social-democrats \nregarded by them as truly internationalist in orientation. \n175 \nInterdistricters were close in strategy to Trotski; and Zinoviev, \ndeliberately or not, was initiating a process which culminated in \nTrotski's entry to the Bolshevik party in July. In accordance with \nthe pre-war writings of Lenin and Stalin, the report stressed the \ndesirability of dissuading non-Russian nationalities from exercising \nthat right. Unhappiness with Lenin's attitude to the national question \nhad long been widespread among Bolsheviks, and the section \nestablished by the Conference to formulate a motion refused to \ngive approval to Stalin's viewpoint. Pyatakov;92 and Pyatakov, Lenin's opponent on \nthe national question, was not minded to give way to Stalin.93 Lenin's ripost was his \nmost passionate contribution to the Conference: 'There's no people \nwhich could be so pervaded by hatred to Russia, there's no people \nwhich could so terribly not love Russia as the Poles. Lenin professed a readiness to contemplate the \nsecession of the Ukrainians as well as the Poles and the Finns; but \nhe predicted that the Ukraine would in the event be content with a \n'fraternal union' with Russia.95 Stalin's final speech dwelt on the \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nusefulness of the national liberation movement as a 'bridge' between \nEast and West.97 There had been \nresistance to Kamenev's standing when the candidatures had been \ndiscussed in closed session because of his behaviour in the Bolshevik \ncourt case of 1915, but Lenin came to his rescue, arguing the need to \nlet bygones be bygones98. Evidently he felt that there was enough \ncommon ground between himself and the leader of the Bolshevik \nright to keep him in the Central Committee; and perhaps he already \nvalued him as a potential counterweight to leftists who might want to \nforce the revolutionary pace even faster than Lenin himself wanted.99 But Lenin and Zinoviev did not get things all \ntheir own way. Sverdlov, whom \nLenin neither knew much about nor wanted in the Central \nCommittee. 101 \nNone of Lenin's colleagues were his stooges, and several were \nhostile to his general strategy. So Lenin would not be able \nto push through his decisions because his colleagues were under \narrest or dispersed in various countries. Even Zinoviev was willing to \ntake him on, urging the Conference to dispatch a representative to \nthe socialist peace conference in Stockholm in order to increase \nBolshevik influence over the European socialist left. 102 Lenin, however, could feel \nsatisfied. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. \nAGAINST DUAL POWER \nThe Bolshevik All-Russian Conference's resolution forbidding social-\nists to enter the Provisional Government was passed in a week when \nLvov was negotiating for Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries to \njoin his cabinet. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. 105 In Petrograd, the \nVyborg District Soviet was solidly hostile to the cabinet after the \nFebruary Revolution. But the lower the level, the stronger the representation of the \nBolsheviks. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' .106 \nBolsheviks concluded that it was only a matter of time and \npolitical effort, before the Petrograd Soviet fell to them, and those \namong them who still hankered after a united Russian Social-\n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDemocratic Labour Party with the Mensheviks diminished. The \nliaison between the Kadet party and the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries strengthened Bolshevik intransigence. This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. \n179 \norganisation were a Bolshevik party priority, and the party activists \nbenefited from the spare time unavailable to their rivals who carried \nthe burdens of central and local governmental office. For Lenin, it \nwas the heyday of his public appearances. 110 \nBolshevik Central Committee policies were modified for popular \nconsumption. The Central Commit-\ntee simplified the April Party Conference's resolutions, which were \nphrased in terms impervious to most non-Marxists, and indeed many \nBolsheviks. Lenin sketched a draft calling for 'no \nsupport' for the Provisional Government and for an end to the war \nwithout annexations and indemnities and with full self-determination \nfor all peoples. 112 Both Lenin and the \nCentral Committee, moreover, avoided mention of the possibility of \n'revolutionary war' or 'European civil war'. These topics continued \nto be addressed among Bolshevik leaders through 1917; but there was \na recognition that such talk would not gain universal approval on the \nstreets. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. 115 Before 1917 his policies had been aimed more at \ngetting support in his party than at communicating with Russian \nsociety; he had seldom worried lest his provocative declarations \nmight prove unacceptable to workers and peasants. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. The scheme for an armed march of protest against \nthe Provisional Government, coinciding with the convocation of the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, was \ninstigated by members of the Bolshevik Military Organisation. \nLenin, without being in constant touch with the Military Organisa-\ntion, had a host of admirers among its leading cadre. Thus their radical-\nism overspilled the bounds respected by Lenin himself since the All-\nRussian April Conference of the Bolshevik party. \n181 \nThis was the nearest any Bolshevik had come since the February \nRevolution to stating how the Provisional Government might be \noverthrown. The Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries held their expected majority; only lOS out \nof 777 were Bolsheviks. It was the high point of the anti-\nBolshevik socialist movement in Russia; and the alliance of Men-\nsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries easily dominated the Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets which was elected to \nassume the functions of national soviet leadership. \nOn the second day, 4 June, Lenin was given the chance to reply on \nbehalf of the Bolsheviks. Lenin exclaimed: 'I reply: \"There \nis. But it was \napparent that the Bolsheviks lacked the support in the country for \nany attempt at the formation of a government. The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. Not even many Bolshevik \ndelegates to the Congress knewY0 A joint meeting of the Central \nCommittee, Military Organisation and the Petersburg Committee's \nExecutive Commission took place on 6 June while the Congress was \nin session; and, behind closed doors, the case for a demonstration \nwas offered by Military Organisation leader N. A clash between Lenin and \nNogin ensued; and Nogin vehemently expostulated: 'Lenin is \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposing a revolution.' 122 But Lenin ignored Nogin's interpretation of his inten-\ntions. It would indeed seem that Lenin was aspiring not to the \ninstallation of a Bolshevik government but rather a transfer of power \nto the soviets, which would have resulted in a government of \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. The Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships were worried by the posters \npinned up around Petrograd by Bolshevik activists. The scene was set for the first \ntest of strength between the Bolsheviks and the Provisional Govern-\nment.127 \nLenin panicked. \nOutvoted, Lenin and Sverdlov abstained. 129 \nThe worry for Lenin was the attitude which might be taken by the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. \nTsereteli objected to Lenin's casual temerity in initiating the \ndemonstration and treated his activity as part of a conspiracy to \nset up a Bolshevik government. His \nvehemence, moreover, was opposed even by several non-Bolsheviks. \nMartov spoke against the proposal for the Bolsheviks to be \nphysically disarmed. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. 131 The result, on 12 June, was that \nthe Bolsheviks were merely censured for recklessness. The Bolsheviks \nparticipated in the demonstration with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries even though there were frictions over the \nBolshevik party's insistence on marching under its own slogans, \nincluding 'All Power To The Soviets'. 133 \nA LEADER ON CAMPAIGN \nDoubts about Lenin's mettle as a revolutionary leader were \nsurfacing. \nThe displeasure was intense since it was the Petersburg Committee's \nactivists and not Lenin who had the uncongenial task of dissuading \nagitated crowds of anti-governmental workers, soldiers and sailors \n 184 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom undertaking a demonstration which the Central Committee had \nencouraged. Nearly all participants in the debate in the Petersburg \nCommittee criticised Lenin's leadership directly or by implication. 134 \nHe survived their anger mainly because no Bolshevik figure on the \nparty's left offered himself as an alternative leader and because he \nhandled his defence with firmness and discretion. 135 \nHe was helped by his status as the whipping boy of the anti-\nBolshevik press. Lenin had become one of a handful of politicians \nknown by name to everyone in the country interested in politics. Most onlookers found the similarities rather \nthan the differences between the Kadets and the non-Bolshevik \nsocialists most impressive. Lenin and his party, by contrast, opposed \nthe entire historic compromise between Russian liberalism and \nRussian 'moderate' socialism; and the barrage of invective fired at \nhim in national newspapers served to enhance his eminence. 137 The net effect of \nthe vilification, at least until early July, was to disseminate the \nproposals of the Bolsheviks more widely. 138 \nLenin and his associates, however, were perturbed by the smear \ncampaign. The party in the provinces expressed its concern, and \nrequests were made to the Central Committee to counter the anti-\nBolshevik tirades by publishing information on the real Lenin, his \nbackground and personality. Lenin began a sketch of his life. Olminski, published in Social-Democrat in Moscow, failed \nto be reproduced elsewhere. 142 Bolsheviks were evidently not \nintending to establish a 'cult' around him. They recognised Lenin \nas their party chief with fewer reservations than the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had about Viktor Chernov or even the Kadets \nabout Pavel Milyukov; 143 but they held back from adulation. The \n'heartfelt greetings' sent by a 7000-strong meeting of workers in \nBogorodsko-Glukhovo to 'the respected fighter and leader of the \nworking class, comrade Lenin' was more the exception than the \nnorm, 144 and Lenin did not pursue exceptional treatment for himself. But even if this is what he was \ndoing, it may well have stemmed from Lenin's instincts rather than \nhis conscious choice: his was not a self-inquiring mind. \nAnd so, whereas the rest of the press presented him as an \nindividual politician capable of bringing down the Provisional \nGovernment, Lenin as ever did not emphasise the word 'I' and \npreferred phrases like 'we, the workers'. 146 He did not lose this combativeness, but \nincreasingly he looked more like a working-class Bolshevik than a \nmiddle-class pedagogue; he obviously found the revolutionary \nenvironment congenial. \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHe proved adept too at mass oratory. May and June 1917 were busy months for him. Lenin suggested that \nwhatever deprivations needed to be made would be paid for by the \nenemies of the working class. 149 \nThis message, with its combination of invocation and reassurance, \nmust have contributed to Lenin's advance on power. After his spectacular and rapturous \nreception at the Finland station on 3 April, he found non-Bolshevik \naudiences less enthusiastic for several weeks. He knew about the provincial political \nprocesses only from newspapers and from Bolshevik activists coming \nto Petrograd for meetings, conferences and congresses \nThis also meant that direct knowledge of Lenin the man was \nthinly-spread in the rest of the country. This was not, at least not yet, the Bolshevik \nparty's style. Bolsheviks printed most pictures of their leaders later in \nthe year, after they had seized power. The contemporary anti-\nBolshevik press saw no advantage in publishing photos of Lenin; \ncartoonists had sport with him, but usually provided a passe-partout \ndrawing of evil and made no attempt at realistic portraiture. \nConsequently Lenin's impact upon general politics in Russia \nstemmed in large measure from his newspaper articles. The year \n1917 was the golden age of Russian print journalism, and Lenin \ndevoted more hours per day to writing for Pravda- he wrote little for \nother Bolshevik outlets- than to any other political function. Only the villages, which had hardly any Bolshevik party \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngroups, were left outside the normal distribution network. Even so, it must be added that nearly \nhalf the copies were sold in Petro grad and that therefore not even all \nliterate Bolshevik rank-and-filers can have read the words of their \nparty leader). 157 \nLenin was Pravda's regular columnist on current political issues; \nand in this role he especially aimed to acquire the support of \nBolshevik committee-men in Petrograd and the localities for his \nstrategy. Using \na term invented by the Bolshevik versifier Demyan Bedny, he called \nthem 'Liberdans' . \nAnd Lenin, like his Central Committee colleagues, carried a heavy \nload of responsibilities on the Bolshevik party's behalf. Lenin and Krupskaya were relieved of the \nbusiness of correspondence with local party committees. Moreover, it was Kamenev's \nmain job to direct the Bolshevik fraction in the Petrograd Soviet \n(whereas Lenin, the great advocate of 'all power to the soviets' in the \n There Is Such a Party. \n189 \nspring, was not elected to the Soviet). Nogin, at his own \ninsistence, worked in the Moscow Soviet. Sverdlov ran the Central Committee Secretariat with a \nsmall but efficient staff and, like Stalin, was among the less 'visible' \nfigures in the Bolshevik leadership. 163 Despite Lenin's doubts about \nhim at the April Bolshevik Conference, Sverdlov could hardly have \nbeen closer to Lenin's policies, and his indefatigable service to the \nCentral Committee and its Secretariat freed Lenin to focus on his \nchosen activities. Zinoviev, too, was emerging as a figure of substance \non the Bolshevik right. A similar mixture of rancour and \npolitical calculation held back leading anti-Lenin Bolsheviks from \nthe pre-war period, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov. They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. A Pravda editorial, in a curious hint about his \nproblem, reported that the invitation had been made 'in the name of \ncomrade Lenin and several Central Committee members' . Even before the February Revolution, as Lenin \nand Zinoviev noted, he had denounced Chkheidze and the Men-\nshevik Duma deputies; 168 and, upon his return to Russia, he agreed \nwith the Bolsheviks that a rupture was desirable with the Menshevik \nleaders who condoned the coalition with the Kadets. He felt that \nLenin, whether he said so or not, had embraced the Trotskyist theory \nof 'permanent revolution' in place of the traditional two-stage \nrevolutionary schedule; and indeed, after joining the Bolsheviks, \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski defended his strategy of 1905-6 with enthusiasm in Bolshevik \npublications. 169 He was not constrained to defer to Lenin, who \nwelcomed Trotski's adhesion to the Bolsheviks not only since he was \nan increasingly needed advocate of radicalism but also because of his \ntechnical and oratorical skills; and he was asked to help with the \nediting of 'a popular organ'; 170 No Bolshevik leader could match his \nrecord in this respect. The development of Lenin as a chairman of \nBolshevik opinion and as a leader who could coax unlikely partners \nto co-operate had begun. \nTHE JULY DAYS \nThe First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies elected a permanent body to co-ordinate soviet affairs \nacross the country. This was the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee (or VTsiK), and its leading members were Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries as well as some Bundists. All were members of the Petrograd \nSoviet, whose importance declined at the national level. Bolsheviks, \nunder Kamenev's leadership, constituted a minority on the All-\nRussian Central Executive Committee. \nThese Bolsheviks could barely believe that the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee, which had relations with virtually all soviets in \ncities and on the Eastern front, refused to take power from the \nKadets. Not surprisingly, Lenin found it difficult to strike the balance \nbetween enunciating a radical strategy and restraining his adherents \nfrom its premature application. 177 \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Petersburg Committee was also in session on 20 June. And yet it was precisely \nnow, on 29 June, that Lenin felt able to take a rest for a few days in \nNeivola, a village in the Finnish countryside some four or five hours \ndistant from Petrograd by local train. In any case he noted \njocularly that, even when he withdrew from speaking engagements in \norder to recuperate, the enemies of the Bolsheviks nevertheless \nclaimed he had turned up and demagogically roused the crowds to \nfury. Lenin was always aware that he needed to \nlook after himself physically. Noskov. 181 In midsummer 1917 the political stakes were much \nhigher, and yet Lenin unconcernedly departed to stay in Vladimir \nBonch-Bruevich's rural dacha. 182 Unintentionally, this leader, who \nthought no one equalled his competence in dealing with affairs at the \napex of the Bolshevik party, was leaving the Central Committee to \nface alone the party's most fiendishly difficult test since the February \nRevolution. Low-level Bolshevik activists were involved. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. 185 Bolsheviks in the \nparty's lower echelons did little to restrain the crowds; some of them \nactively fomented trouble. When the news reached the Petrograd \nBolshevik City Conference, the delegates ignored the Central \nCommittee's prohibition and offered to lead the demonstration 'if \nthis proved necessary'. \nBut they would not budge, to the delight of a Bolshevik All-Russian \nBureau of Military Organisations which announced its readiness to \nguide the demonstration. But the \nBolshevik leadership, in the Petersburg Committee and in the All-\nRussian Bureau of Military Organisations, were following rather \nthan guiding events; and, although most participants hoped that the \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nturmoil would somehow result in the overthrow of the Provisional \nGovernment, they had no definite set of tactics. The worry \npersisted that the outcome would not be happy, and the Bolshevik \ncentral leaders wanted to take as few obviously incriminating steps as \npossible. 193 Lenin and his companions, \nBonch-Bruevich and his sister Mariya dressed hurriedly. They made for the \nKshesinskaya palace to seek out the Bolshevik leaders. Sverdlov and \nAnatoli Lunacharski addressed them from the balcony; and Lenin, \nwho had in the meantime arrived, was asked to come out to say a few \nwords. Kalinin, who \nhad no warmer desire than Lenin for a demonstration, was to recall \nthat Lenin nevertheless spoke with his fellow leaders as if he was still \nnot completely convinced that the march would be a fiasco and that \nthe Provisional Government would not fail. Pereverzev, \ncontacting troops in the capital who had not declared support for \neither side, released the bits of circumstantial information in the \nhands of the authorities which purported to show that Lenin was a \nGerman spy. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. The \nBolshevik Central Committee called on the crowds to leave the \nstreets. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. \nLenin declared that the revolutionary process was entering a critical \nphase. The Bolshevik \nparty needed to make tactical adjustments to survive and flourish \nagain.204 \nESCAPE TO THE LAKES \nAnti-Bolshevik repression had ensued in Petrograd. The deaths of \ndemonstrators ran into the hundreds, and there were many reports of \nviolence being meted out to known or suspected Bolsheviks \nencountered on the streets. Lenin, Kamenev and Zinoviev headed the \nlist of those hunted by the authorities. \nTrotski and Lunacharski, despite not belonging to the Bolshevik \nparty, had been involved in negotiations about the demonstration; \nthey too were sought by troops loyal to the Provisional Govern-\nment. The exceptions were Lenin and Zinoviev. This was odd \nin its way since Lenin was guiltless, unless it was a crime to take a \nholiday when great events were in the making. As regards Zinoviev, \nhe retained a reputation as a radical Bolshevik but was by now closer \nto Kamenev than to Lenin, and had opposed the demonstration from \nits conception. They had consistently \nrepudiated the accusation, taking space in Bolshevik newspapers to \nexplain their story and to stress that they would have returned via \nFrance and the North Sea if only the Allied authorities had given \npermission. \n197 \nBurtsev had spent a career exposing police agents in the Russian \nrevolutionary movement; Aleksinski was a former Bolshevik whose \nhostility to Lenin had induced him to found a newspaper, Without \nSuperfluous Words, dedicated wholly to the exposure of Bolshevik \nmisdeeds. 207 \nEven so, Lenin and Zinoviev initially thought to deliver themselves \nup to the authorities on condition that the Petrograd Soviet would \nguarantee physical protection and a fair trial. 208 Several Bolsheviks \nadvised this.209 It was Kamenev's less than totally defiant \ncomportment at his trial in 1915 that continued to earn him \ncontempt among fellow Bolsheviks after the February Revolu-\ntion. The additional consideration was that all revolutionary parties, \nincluding the Bolsheviks, assumed that no single leader's fate should \nbe put before the good of the party and the Revolution. \nAbruptly, on 8 July, Lenin and Zinoviev had second thoughts and \ndecided to avoid arrest. 211 \nBy then, however, several newspapers were baying for Lenin's blood. \nGruesome cartoons depicted Lenin on a scaffold.212 But Bolshevik \ncalls for him to surrender himself to the authorities subsided, and \nLenin and Zinoviev went into hiding in the capital.214 For \nthe next month they stayed with the Bolshevik and factory worker \nNikolai Emelyanov, who had, like many Russian workers, retained a \nhouse and some land in the countryside. Lenin and Zinoviev slept in \nthe barn-loft. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe two men felt able to stroll around so long as they took \nreasonable care, but scares sometimes happened. On one occasion \nthe sight of approaching armed men caused Lenin and Zinoviev to \ndive into a haystack. Lenin whispered to his companion: 'The only \nthing left now is to die decently. The Provisional Government's repressive zeal was fading \nsomewhat, and Lenin and Zinoviev received secret visits from \nBolshevik Central Committee members. 218 By 26 \nJuly, Lenin's articles were appearing in it.'220 \nYet Lenin and Zinoviev felt insecure even near Sestroretsk. A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN. For Kerenski, Lenin was only the tip of \n There Is Such a Party. The Bolshevik party had a warm relationship with. A Finnish-and-Swedish \nphrase book also seemed a good idea, and Lenin asked for a do-it-\nyourself hairdresser's clipper in case he needed to disguise his \nappearance. Lenin had a photo-\ngraph taken of his self-transformation. This time Lenin \nmasqueraded as an engine stoker.226 Lenin pressed on \nwith his research for The State and Revolution, and continued to \nsubmit articles to the Bolshevik central newspapers and to write to \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee. 227 \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Finns made Lenin's contacts with the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee easier than they had been in Razliv. Nor did he expect the existing chance of a \nBolshevik assumption of power to recur: it was now or never. \n 7 The Fire Next Time: \nJuly to September 1917 \nCONSIDERATIONS ON PARTY STRATEGY \nThe internal life of parties in revolutionary Russia ran on the basis of \npersuasion and consent. The Bolsheviks were feared for their \ndiscipline and hierarchy; and yet their party was, by the standards \nof its own rulebook, highly ill-disciplined.tensions affected relations at all \nlevels of the Bolshevik party's formal hierarchy. Thus the Bolsheviks \nwere not so unlike the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as \nlater mythology contended; 1 and the fact that the Bolshevik party \nwas ill co-ordinated allowed its local activists to react dynamically to \nthe particularity of local events. The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. Being \ninnocent of the co-responsibility for the Provisional Government \nwhich affected their rivals, Bolsheviks could organise their political \ncampaign unfettered. The disagreements among the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries led instead to factionalism; both had left \nwings which wanted to break with the Kadets entirely: and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries were to split into two separate parties in \nNovember 1917. In these conditions it was natural for dissentient \nleftists at lower levels to leave and join the Bolsheviks. Lenin aimed to introduce \nboth clarity and determination.", "Anti_Governmental_1917": " The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution.'79 It deserves emphasis here, in \nthe light of what was to become Soviet policy in 1918, that this policy \nwas far short of advocacy of 'revolutionary war' . The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' . The seriousness of the \nBolshevik party's intentions about an anti-governmental demonstra-\ntion were not yet public knowledge. Trotski, not yet a Bolshevik but showing \nsympathy with Lenin, blisteringly denounced the Provisional Gov-\nernment and its socialist ministers. But it was \nnot so embarrassing in the 'mass politics' of 1917. The need for strong government and strong solutions was \nacute. Counter-revolution was on the offensive. A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN.", "Bourgeois_Revolution_1917": " The same was done by both the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, who had traditionally \nexpected that the overthrow of the Romanov monarchy would \ninaugurate the rule of the bourgeoisie. \nContinuing to think that socialism in backward Russia was a \npremature project and that national unity was essential in wartime, \nthey hoped to constrain the Provisional Government to act within \nthe limits of policies based on democratic political liberties and \nterritorial defence; and, immediately after the February Revolution, \nmost workers, peasants and soldiers felt likewise. The \nstimulus for the Bolsheviks, who before 1917 had attacked the \nliberals more aggressively than had the Mensheviks, to fight to \nreplace the Provisional Government with a socialist regime would \nincrease. Yet in general they were \nworking with the grain of the popular grievances in 1917. Aleksandr Bogdanov, still more bluntly, called \nLenin's theses 'the ravings of a madman'; and Fyodor Dan called \nthem 'the party's funeral', adding that the 'bourgeois revolution' was \nincomplete. His original intention had been to specify that, if a general \npeace without annexations and indemnities could not be brought \nabout, a new socialist administration should fight a 'revolutionary \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwar' against imperialism.46 Workers and soldiers, as all Bolsheviks \nwere aware, were still busily extending their rights; and already there \nwere signs that wage settlements would not keep pace with inflation. For the Bolsheviks, the 'April crisis' had profound \nconsequences. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. Lenin \nmaintained, in disregard of Kamenev's earlier arguments, that 'the \nbourgeois revolution' had been completed. \nKamenev, with impeccable Marxist logic, asked yet again how on \nearth could the bourgeois revolution be said to have ended while the \nlanded gentry retained their estates. He queried, too, the basis in \nMarxist thought for a socialist administration involving not only 'the \nproletariat' but also the peasantry. What had happened to Marx's \nsimple and unadorned dictatorship of the proletariat. Bagdatev was especially mordant, \nstating that it was difficult to discern a completed bourgeois \nrevolution when the gentry retained their land and neither a system \nof progressive taxation nor the eight-hour working day had been \npromulgated.' The war, he added, was imperialistic \nand could be ended 'only by worldwide revolution'. Bubnov stirred things up again by asserting that it was \ninept to squabble over whether the revolution was bourgeois or \nsocialist; for him, the situation was more complex, and elements of \nboth types of revolution were present. 72 Or perhaps \nLenin had invested so much intellectual capital in the concept of an \nalready completed bourgeois revolution that he could not quickly \nwithdraw. 74 Lenin \nand F. 86 This strangely indefinite wording surely signifies that \nLenin was contemplating a faster movement towards the setting up \nof collective farming than he had previously envisaged; and this must \nhave been sweet music to the ears of those on the Bolshevik left who \ndreamed that the collectivisation of agriculture could quickly be \ndecreed and imposed by a forthcoming socialist administration.95 Stalin's final speech dwelt on the \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nusefulness of the national liberation movement as a 'bridge' between \nEast and West. The worst omen for the Provisional Government was the \nBolshevik majority at the First City Conference of Factory-Work-\nshop Committees in May 1917, and its acceptance of Lenin's motion \non measures to deal with 'economic ruin' . This was also, \nhowever, a source of delight for the Bolsheviks, who could stand up \nat open public meetings and denounce the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries for conniving in the 'bourgeois rule' and the \nprolongation of a worldwide imperialist war. Bolsheviks did not believe that a socialist revolution \nwould occur by spontaneous self-generation. A clash between Lenin and \nNogin ensued; and Nogin vehemently expostulated: 'Lenin is \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposing a revolution.

They repudiated \nLenin's case that the transition to socialism could be begun in \nbackward and war-torn Russia. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. \nLenin declared that the revolutionary process was entering a critical \nphase.

A Socialist Revolutionary, \nN. \n 7 The Fire Next Time: \nJuly to September 1917 \nCONSIDERATIONS ON PARTY STRATEGY \nThe internal life of parties in revolutionary Russia ran on the basis of \npersuasion and consent. The Bolsheviks, furthermore, had \nthe inestimable advantage of agreement on certain key ideas: that the \nProvisional Government should be overthrown and a socialist \nadministration of some sort established; that urgent moves be made \nto end the war; that the peasants should get the land and that the \neconomic rights of the bourgeoisie should be curtailed. The disagreements among the Mensheviks and \nSocialist Revolutionaries led instead to factionalism; both had left \nwings which wanted to break with the Kadets entirely: and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries were to split into two separate parties in \nNovember 1917.", "Petrograd_Soviet_1917": " Soldiers demanded a relaxation of \ndiscipline and the permission to elect their own committees to \nrepresent their interests; and the Petrograd Soviet issued its 'Order \nNo.7 Returning \nto Petrograd, Lenin was adept in expressing popular attitudes which \nhad not yet fully developed. It was they who were chosen by the Russian \nBureau of the Central Committee to put the Bolshevik case at the \nassembly of soviet deputies, drawn from all over the country, which \nmet in Petrograd from 29 March. On 30 March, the Mensheviks and Bundists \nretracted their support from the motion criticising the Petrograd \nSoviet. Tsereteli carried a motion of support for the \nPetrograd Soviet by 325 votes against 57 when the Bolsheviks and the \nMensheviks emerged from their respective fractions to debate at the \nnational conference of soviets; he even persuaded several Bolsheviks \nto the right of Kamenev, such as V. Russian \nBureau member V. Yet it was \nTsereteli, the Petrograd Soviet's dominant figure, who offered the \nmost sustained criticism.32 The Bolshevik right wing was severely \nweakened. Furthermore, the Kamenevites who had manipulated \nPravda and buffeted the Russian Bureau in March did not reflect \nthe opinions of all Bolsheviks among lower committees, especially at \nthe district level, in Petrograd. Only 15 per cent of Bolshevik delegates to the national \nsoviet conference in Petrograd from 29 March to 2 April were re-\nelected to the Conference which opened three weeks later. The \nPetrograd Bolsheviks met on 14 April. 38 Lenin \nalso modified his presentation at the Petrograd City Conference \nitself. At the Petro grad City Conference, \nY. Bagdatev and several other leaders of the Petrograd City \nOrganisation on 21 April issued a leaflet urging the immediate \noverthrow of the Provisional Government. From April \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \n1917 the Bolsheviks followed a clear (if not totally straight) line of \nopposition to the Provisional Government, and sowed and cultivated \nthe seeds of a further revolution. 56 The soviets would \nembody the new state power. 59 \nLenin sat down; he had shown, as at the Petrograd City \nConference just days before, that he could adjust his public posture \n There Is Such a Party. On balance, \nNogin wanted Bolshevik representatives to attend, if only to contact \nand co-ordinate activities among the European socialist left. 74 Lenin \nand F. \nThis provoked Lenin to remark that Petrograd and Moscow were \nnow lagging behind the provinces in revolutionary achievement. His proposed \nclauses were basically the same as those of the Petrograd City \nConference: he saw the soviets and other mass organisations as the \nlikely organs of revolutionary governmental authority. particularly those who were only visiting \nPetrograd, wanted to know more about events in the capital. Fedorov, member of the \nPetersburg City Committee (which refused to change its name to the \nPetrograd Committee as a protest against the government's 'chau-\nvinism' in renaming the capital), reported on the progress of the \nPetrograd Soviet debate on the acceptability of a government \ncoalition of liberals and socialists. Furthermore, virtually the entire \nCentral Committee would be based in Petrograd. Smilga could shuttle freely \nbetween Petrograd and nearby Finland. \n177 \nwith a dynamic political organism such as the Bolshevik party. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, remem-\nbering that the Bolshevik prohibition was in line with the Second \nInternational's policy, 103 regarded the invitation with distaste; and \nKerenski had had to seek special permission from the Petrograd \nSoviet before becoming Minister of Justice in March. 104 But the \nApril crisis over foreign policy showed that the Provisional Govern-\nment would be impotent unless individuals from the Petrograd \nSoviet's leadership were included. 105 In Petrograd, the \nVyborg District Soviet was solidly hostile to the cabinet after the \nFebruary Revolution.106 \nBolsheviks concluded that it was only a matter of time and \npolitical effort, before the Petrograd Soviet fell to them, and those \namong them who still hankered after a united Russian Social-\n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDemocratic Labour Party with the Mensheviks diminished. Tsereteli was aware \nthat his duties as Minister of Post and Telegraphs prevented him \nfrom giving due attention to the affairs of the Petrograd Soviet. He spoke at the First All-\nRussian Congress of Peasants' Deputies and the First Petrograd City \nConference of Factory-Workshop Committees in May, and at the \nFirst All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' \nDeputies in June. The incentive came with the need to set out a list of the \nparty's demands and slogans for the forthcoming election of deputies \nto the Petrograd Soviet. Instead, the \ndemand was made, more vaguely, for a transfer of power to the \nsoviets, which would exert 'control' over production and distribu-\n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntion. The Menshevik \nand Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships were worried by the posters \npinned up around Petrograd by Bolshevik activists. The First All-\nRussian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies as a precaution \nbanned the holding of any armed demonstration without the \npermission of the Petrograd Soviet. The banning of a demonstration by the Petrograd \nSoviet had not entered his calculations. \nBesides Central Committee sessions and local party occasions in \nPetrograd, Lenin had to address eleven large gatherings. These \nincluded not only formal speeches to the Petrograd Conference of \nFactory-Workshop Committees, the All Russian Congress of Pea-\nsants' Deputies and the All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' \nand Soldiers' Deputies but also five open-air speeches at the gates of \nPetrograd factories. Petrograd was a base from where he ventured only \nrarely. Apart from a \nweekend summerhouse jaunt to the countryside outside Petro grad, he \nhad no acquaintance with rural Russia in the first three months after \nhis arrival at the Finland Station. 153 But nothing would have induced him to shift his focus \nof work from Petrograd. Even so, it must be added that nearly \nhalf the copies were sold in Petro grad and that therefore not even all \nliterate Bolshevik rank-and-filers can have read the words of their \nparty leader). 157 \nLenin was Pravda's regular columnist on current political issues; \nand in this role he especially aimed to acquire the support of \nBolshevik committee-men in Petrograd and the localities for his \nstrategy. Moreover, it was Kamenev's \nmain job to direct the Bolshevik fraction in the Petrograd Soviet \n(whereas Lenin, the great advocate of 'all power to the soviets' in the \n There Is Such a Party. \n189 \nspring, was not elected to the Soviet). He reached Petrograd from the emigration \nonly in May 1917. All were members of the Petrograd \nSoviet, whose importance declined at the national level. And yet it was precisely \nnow, on 29 June, that Lenin felt able to take a rest for a few days in \nNeivola, a village in the Finnish countryside some four or five hours \ndistant from Petrograd by local train. Noskov. 183 \nThe crisis for the Bolshevik Central Committee coincided with a \ncrisis in the Provisional Government. Workers downed tools at the \nPutilov factory and other enterprises, and sailors from the Kronstadt \nnaval garrison began to arrive in Petrograd. When the news reached the Petrograd \nBolshevik City Conference, the delegates ignored the Central \nCommittee's prohibition and offered to lead the demonstration 'if \nthis proved necessary'. The crowds swelled around the \nTauride Palace where the Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional \nGovernment were based. In less than \nthree quarters of an hour they had caught the morning train for \nPetrograd, pulling into the Finland station at eleven o'clock. 198 \nThe Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leadership of the \nPetrograd Soviet, stiffened by Tsereteli's resolve, resisted the \npressure to take power. \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was disrupted and demoralised \nand Pravda's printing press was seized. The Bolshevik \nparty needed to make tactical adjustments to survive and flourish \nagain.204 \nESCAPE TO THE LAKES \nAnti-Bolshevik repression had ensued in Petrograd. 207 \nEven so, Lenin and Zinoviev initially thought to deliver themselves \nup to the authorities on condition that the Petrograd Soviet would \nguarantee physical protection and a fair trial. \nManuilski, who had contacts with factory workers in Petrograd.213 The next \ntwenty-four hours convinced them that Petrograd was too dangerous \nfor them. Politics \nin Petrograd remained unstable. The question of law and order in \nPetrograd and other cities lay under the surface; and frequent \ndiscussions were held between the new premier and General Lavr \nKornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of Russian armed forces, in \npursuit of a solution.221 \nLenin desired to put greater distance between Petrograd and \nhimself. The Bolshevik party had a warm relationship with. 9 The View from \nPetrograd: November to \nDecember 1917 \nNEGOTIATIONS ON POWER \nThe 'October Revolution' was not a single act which titanically \nprescribed the entire political process for the rest of the country. Some preceded, others followed the \nMilitary-Revolutionary Committee's seizure of power in Petrograd. Consequently, the Bolshevik Central Committee, with \nmuch skill and not a little luck, linked its political revolution in \nPetrograd to the revolutions elsewhere. Yet the Bolshevik Central Committee appreciated \nthat, in the disintegrated and localised condition of politics at the \ntime, the Petrograd seizure remained as yet a local revolution. 'Soviet power' under the Bolshevik aegis had to be \ndisseminated across the country. \nIn those first weeks it was unclear whether the Bolshevik-led \nrevolution in Petrograd would prove adequate to guide and \ndominate the others. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. \nAnd yet both Lenin and Trotski had returned from emigration, \nand their activity in late October gave them a directing influence over \nthe design of the government and its policies which emerged from the \nuprising in Petrograd. Out of 366 \nsoviets and army committees represented at the Second Congress of \nSoviets, according to an incomplete but believable questionnaire, 255 \nhad sent delegates to Petrograd on this basis; and no delegate had \nbeen dispatched with a mandate to seek the extrusion of non-\nBolsheviks from the new government. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. Bolshevik power in Moscow \n The View from Petrograd \n277 \nhad been secured; Vikzhel's authority over its own railwaymen was \nsuccessfully challenged by the creation of a new union under \nBolshevik direction; and food supplies were at last reaching central \nRussia from the Volga. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. They were consumed by \nthe problems of setting up Sovnarkom; of brow-beating his party's \nCentral Committee; of cajoling the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ninto office; of overseeing the disposition of military and political \nforces in Petrograd to ensure the final removal of Kerenski and his \ndiminishing band of supporters; of writing and elaborating the \nlegislation which poured forth from the government's chaotic offices \nin the Smolny Institute. Shortages of personnel, funds and propaganda material \nwere more severe in the provinces than in Petrograd. The \nSmolny Institute teemed with people who had come off Petrograd's \nstreets and brought news of the dislocation produced by the October \nRevolution; but Lenin, who had had much success in identifying \nhimself with the cause of the working class, gave little evidence of \nacquaintance with the concrete circumstances produced by the \nseizure of power. Asked for advice and assistance by the Berdyansk \nBolshevik Committee, he responded: 'You understand, comrade, \nthat it is difficult to give you instructions any more concrete than \n\"All Power To The Soviets\". Moscow \nwas a case in point. Not only Moscow but also the town of Vladimir and the \nDonbass region were discussed, but the topics related to nationalisa-\ntion and financial assignations rather than to detailed political \n The View from Petrograd \n281 \nguidance and military support; and it had been local Bolshevik and \nsoviet organs which had put them on to the agenda. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. A peaceful process was reported in Ivanovo-Voznesensk \nafter the arrival of news about the Petrograd insurrection on 27 \nOctober. \nTo the north-west, around Petrograd, it was the same story. The Petrograd Soviet, despite \na certain finessing of its relations with Kerenski in order to avoid the \naccusation of overt disobedience, had set such an example.39 The Urals, too, \nhad soviets willing to recognise Sovnarkom. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918. Sovnarkom's chairman is recorded as having \nreceived a few dozen visitations from outside Petrograd in November \nand December 1917. And, when \nreportage on local developments reached Petrograd (and it must be \nborne in mind that Sverdlov was meeting more people),47 Sovnarkom \nand the Bolshevik Central Committee were confirmed in their \noptimism. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. 56 \nLenin and Stalin remained allies on the national question; and, \nsince principal opponents such as Bukharin and Pyatakov were \noutside Petrograd (in Moscow and Kiev), and others such as \nDzierzynski were busy in the Military-Revolutionary Committee, \nthey pushed forward with the official policy as formulated by the \nApril Party Conference. Svinhufvud did \nnot want to offend the Allies and wanted to obtain independence \nfrom the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd. At last, on 18 December 1917, a bemused official \ndelegation from Helsinki to Petrograd obtained on request a \ndocument confirming the secession of Finland from ties of state \nwith Russia. The prospect of conflict with the \nSoviet authorities in Petrograd was increased by the Rada's demand \nthat any future state settlement should involve a federal union \nbetween Russia and the Ukraine. Apart from disseminating copies of its legislation of 25-26 \nOctober, it had contented itself with appeals to the brotherhood of \nnations and with the restoration of Ukrainian treasures and national \n The View from Petrograd \n287 \nsymbols to Kiev as proofs of good intent. Troops were dispatched from Petrograd under the \nleadership of V. 72 But they needed Petrograd's support \nand succumbed to Lenin's pressure; and the knowledge of their \nelectoral weakness in the Ukraine dissuaded them from disobedience \nto the Bolshevik Central Committee. His \ndisappointments hardened his policy: no plebiscites on national \n The View from Petrograd \n289 \naspirations would be held on Soviet-governed territory; and the \nidea that the interests of the working class, as distinct from the \nnation as whole, in each non-Russian region should be paramount \nwas increasingly used as a device to maintain the borders of the old \nempire.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror.'85 \nSystematic summary repression which did not go as far as gross \nphysical maltreatment or capital punishment occurred with not only \nthe sanction but even the straightforward encouragement of the \ncentral Soviet authorities in the first month of Soviet power, and \nseveral weeks before the establishment of the All-Russian Extra-\nordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Specula-\ntion and Sabotage (or, as it appears in its Russian acronym: the \nCheka), which is rightly regarded as the forerunner of today's KGB. He admired the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee's ruthlessness in rooting out saboteurs, \nspeculators and opponents of the regime; and he knew how little \ncontrol over its activities was exercised by the Petrograd Soviet. On 8 \nNovember Trotski informed Western ambassadors in Petrograd \nabout the Soviet government's commitment to the achievement of \nsuch an armistice. Trotski met with their various representatives in \nPetrograd 102 Lenin, either because of preoccupation with domestic \naffairs or else because he wished others to be tainted with \ninvolvement in such unpleasant duties, held himself aloof. Far from being embarrassed by the Soviet demand for \n'national self-determination' as the principle to underlie any general \npeace in Europe, German Foreign Secretary Ricard von Kuhlmann \nemployed it to undermine the Bolsheviks' pretensions to sovereignty \n The View from Petrograd \n295 \nover most of the old Russian empire. Consultations of popular \nopinion in the Ukraine and in regions of the Baltic provinces and the \nTranscaucasus would predictably fail to produce pro-Bolshevik \nmajorities. The Soviet \ndelegation was headed by A. 107 On 18 December, Lenin came to Sovnark-\nom with a motion stressing the need to prepare Petrograd's \ndefences. If Lenin was going to change his party's policy, the \npolitical campaign would make the struggle for The April Theses \n The View from Petrograd \n297 \nseem child's play. 116 No date for a reply from Petrograd \nwas set, but Lenin foresaw that Trotski's delaying tactics might soon \nprove insufficient. \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDARKENING THOUGHTS \nIntimidating developments at Brest-Litovsk did not dispel the \noptimism of the Bolshevik leaders in either Petrograd or the \nprovinces. 123 Poor Lenin. The Saratov City Soviet, \nhaving replaced the agencies of the Provisional.

The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in 1910, none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:1d in store for him. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility. He \ngenuinely detested the entire political and social order of capitalism \nin his country and abroad; his will to rid society of oppression and \nexploitation gave meaning to his life. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. Liquidators \nand Ultimatumists were detested equally by Lenin, who wanted both \na strengthening of the illegal committees and the flexible use of the \nDuma as a forum for party propaganda. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party.3 \n All or Nothing \n3 \nImmediately after the plenum, Lenin started to pick the locks. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. \nMany fellow Bolsheviks among the Marxist emigres distrusted his \nintense anti-Menshevism, and these still desired party unity. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. 12 \nIn the emigration as well as in the Russian empire, moreover, the \nfeeling persisted that greater attention should be paid to activity and \npropaganda in Russia. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. 13 The Russian \nsecret police undertook sophisticated measures to hunt down leading \nrevolutionaries. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. 17 \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. \nLenin punched back. Again Lenin aimed his blows low.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all. Trotski's emigre journalism, with \narticles excoriating the 'Leninists' for their intransigence and \nsectarianism, increased his influence.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. This was not Lenin's conscious intention. Trotski's ultra-leftism in the sphere of Marxist political \nstrategy did not prevent him from rallying to those Mensheviks in \nRussia who had hit upon the idea of collecting signatures for a \nworkers' petition for the government to grant full freedom of \nassociation. 27 Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance. 29 Trotski's ideas were distorted \nby his Bolshevik critics: he continued to assert that both violent and \npeaceful political methods ought to be undertaken by the party. 30 \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept.31 \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. The resistance to Lenin's \nonslaughts in the following months was bound to be weaker; and the \ncomposition of the forthcoming Party Conference was ever likelier to \nproduce a triumph for him. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom.43 \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication. Bolshevik activists moved between Russia and the emigra-\ntion; but it was generally agreed that the Okhrana had shattered \nmany of the old links.44 \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May 1911 meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices. He was convinced that a tightly-\ncentralised party offered the best chance to take advantage of \nRussian labour unrest.45 He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted.48 \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin.49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. Lenin \nwas an inveterate pedagogue and spoke in the characteristic pose of a \nschoolmaster, with thumbs pressed hard into the armholes of his \nwaistcoat. He delivered fifty-six lectures at Longjumeau, his topics \nincluding general disquisitions on political economy as well as more \ndetailed offerings on his favourite theme: the agrarian question in the \nRussian empire. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. \nOrdzhonikidze and his fellow Longjumeau graduates, Breslav and \nShvarts, who were working for the Russian Organisational Commis-\nsion, found widespread 'disarray' and 'collapse'. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. 55 Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. The fact \nthat in I91 0 there were only about I 0,000 organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions, 56 did not depress him.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'.59 Already, too, the Russian \nworking class had accomplished wonders in less than two decades. 60 \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless;61 and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness.62 Trots-\nki's explanation was that the Marxist movement was dominated by \nintellectuals. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). Lenin's refusal to reply \ndirectly to Trotski's argument convinced his enemies that his \npersistent schismatism had no intellectually respectable rationale; \nthey increasingly regarded him as a would-be Nietzschean 'super-\nman'. \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition.68 But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug. The legally-published St \nPetersburg Marxist newspaper Luch ('Ray') railed against 'the \ndictatorship in the party of supermen with a cynical attitude to the \nmasses'.69 This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n11 \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.'70 Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'. His self-\nconfidence was accompanied by an intolerance bolstered by the \nintrospective conditions of the emigre disputes that typified the \nRussian revolutionary movement. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. Of course, he \ncould not speak openly about his sense of personal vocation; this was \nalien to the comradely and collectivist ethic of Marxism. Instead he \ntalked about the destiny of 'the proletariat', not about his own; and \nhe tried to submerge his identity in the cause of the Marxist \nrevolutionary movement, proclaiming that 'we, the workers' were \nmarching towards a world socialist order. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole.73 In vain Lenin put the following proposition to \nhim: 'One cannot sit between two stools; it's a matter of being either \nfor or against the Liquidators'.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished. 75 In addition, Poletaev believed that the surest way to \noutmatch the Liquidators in the capital was to establish a Bolshevik \ndaily newspaper. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'. 77 Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption. Lenin had written fly-sheets for workers in the \n1890s; and his pamphlet 'To the Village Poor' in 1900 was a model of \nits kind.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. \nRussian public discussion was effervescent in books, journals and \nnewspapers. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them. There is no trace in \nLenin's writings of the gossip about the empress Aleksandra, and he \nsaid little even about the self-styled 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted.85 It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence.87 Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A. It is an interesting \nvignette in the history of Russian intellectual thought; for Finn-\nEnotaevski declared that, in the 1908 second edition of the book, \nLenin had acknowledged that recently-published figures on horse \nownership had caused him to retract the assertions of the first \nedition.88 Lenin had made no such retraction; on the contrary, he \nhad asserted that the new figures bolstered his original case. The \nepisode is yet another sign that Lenin's ideas could be understood in \nways diametrically opposite to those which he really held (and that \nthis was not a phenomenon peculiar to the years after his death); it \nalso shows that the Bolsheviks were not devoid of theorists such as \nFinn-Enotaevski who already perceived that rural life was more \ncomplex than as portrayed by the Lenin of the 1890s. \nSuch realism among Bolsheviks came to the fore only after 1921, \nwhen an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt pushed Lenin into introducing \na New Economic Policy granting large economic and social \nconcessions to the peasantry. \nIn the years immediately before 1917, Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique. Karl Kautsky's works were read assiduous-\nly; and Lenin admired his attacks on Eduard David, who argued \nagainst Marx's assumption that large-scale capitalist agricultural \nestates might not turn out to be as competitive on the world market \nas small, owner-occupied farms.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. 93 Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. Yet the substance of his commentary signalled a \nshift of emphasis in his interpretation of Russian economic condi-\ntions. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.97 Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry.98 The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries. His \ncategories for the bourgeoisie were crude.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. In 1912, newspapers in \nRussia were exercised by one of their recurrent debates about foreign \ncapitalist penetration and domination; xenophobia was rampant. \nLenin scathingly pointed out that innumerable Russian firms and \ntheir owners profited from the influx of alien capital; and he urged \nthat those Duma deputies who played the 'patriotic' card should \nhave their stocks and shares investigated to see whether they stood to \nbenefit from a change in the regime's financial policy. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. It seems a significant lapse for a writer with the special \nbias towards the 'proletariat' that being a Marxist involves. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state. This, in Lenin's \n All or Nothing \n17 \npresentation, was a form of 'Bonapartism'.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. 107 Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. 111 At its core were Lenin's speculations on the reasons why \nthe Kadets, as the leading liberal party, acquired so few seats. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. 114 \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n1911, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad. 117 \n All or Nothing \n19 \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. Ordzhonikidze blatantly \naspired to the arrangement of a Bolshevik-dominated Conference; he \ninvited a few Party Mensheviks (who were close to Plekhanov and \nopposed Martov's gentleness with the so-called Liquidators), but \nonly with the purpose of giving the impression that the Conference \nwas more open to the party as a whole than it really would be. He and his friends \ndiscerned that Lenin aimed to reconstruct a Central Committee \nunder his personal control and, by means of the Conference, claim \nthat it presided over the entire party. 120 \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. Two \nrepresentatives from Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks turned up and \nstayed, and Ordzhonikidze was used by Lenin as his 'expert' in \nhandling them at the Conference. 122 \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. Worse \nstill, from Lenin's viewpoint, was the fact that six delegates had come \nunder the assumption that other factions were being invited. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists. 123 Ordzhoni-\nkidze informed fellow delegates that Lenin might walk out if the \nrecipients of these late invitations turned up. 124 Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. 125 A reassured \nLenin came to recognise that these same invitations could be used to \namplify the fictional story that he had genuinely sought to involve all \nfactions in the Prague Conference. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 128 \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n21 \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. 132 Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 133 Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable. 142 Ordzhonikidze took offence, especially at Lenin's \ninsinuation that the anti-emigre noises were merely tearful laments. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. 146 Lenin \nstressed that such organisations need not be tightly-structured. 147 Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. 148 \nGoloshchekin concurred with the Menshevik speaker, adding that \nLenin had painted an 'idealistic picture'. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. 154 Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 155 In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. 160 \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. 163 Secondly, many of the \n'Leninists' had criticised the emigres at the Conference; and they \nincluded newly-elected members of the Central Committee Ordzho-\nnikidze, Spandaryan and Goloshchekin. 164 \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. At the Second Party Congress, in 1903, Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg, instructing their \nrepresentatives at the Congress by letter, argued that Polish \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindependence was an irrelevance in a capitalist world which was \nmaking economic nonsense of all frontiers. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart \nin 1907 Luxemburg, Martov and Lenin collaborated closely. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. And it \nannoyed Lenin, but not to the point of rupture; indeed he came, in \n1917, to see the uses of deploying a programmatic slogan very similar \nto that of Jogiches. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. 183 Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. 184 Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. 185 \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. In his own organisation, Jogiches was as author-\nitarian and intolerant as Lenin and he entirely lacked the Bolshevik \nleader's more attractive personal qualities. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. 199 \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'. Those Poles who stayed as his allies were destined to play a \nrole alongside Lenin in the realignment of forces within the European \nsocialist left in the First World War. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-1914. 201 But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in 1914; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in 1915-16,202 and, in 1917, \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.204 Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. Yet \nnobody near to him remembered him as having shown an awareness \nof the liberties he frequently took in interpreting Marxian texts; and, \nwhile Lenin was wrong to claim his analyses as being the only true \ndevelopment of Marxism, he was frequently justified in declaring that \nhis adversaries had traduced Marx's intentions. The extraordinary feature of Lenin's treatment was its \nnear-metaphysical lack of doubt in Marx and Engels; no prominent \nMarxist gave so overtly unquestioning a commitment. \nLenin fought for Marx as his 'teacher', but chose carefully where \nto make a stand. Marxism was under a remarkable intellectual attack \nby a number of German politicians and academics. It was consequently utopian for \nMarxists to think th<ti patterns of government could be drastically \ntransformed by political revolution.209 Lenin held back from \nthe fray.210 \nBut a thinker's quality is revealed as much by his silences as by his \nstatements; and Lenin's failure to address the pertinent questions \nraised by Michels and Weber damages his reputation as a political \ntheorist even for his own epoch. \nHis efforts on Marx's behalf in the last few years before the First \nWorld War were mainly in the field of economics. He stood by the \nMarxian theory of 'immiseration'.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.212 But the comment presumably seemed \nto Lenin, on reflection, too much like a retreat; and he added that \nGerman wages were not rising in real value and that inflation was \nsoaring more steeply.13 This could have constituted a return to the \nfirst version of Marx's immiseration theory; but Lenin refrained from \nproposing the trend as a general norm. \nMarx exhilarated him, and those studies of Lenin which entirely \ndeny his Marxist commitment are profoundly erroneous.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era.215 Lenin did not foresee the mass purchases of electrical \ngoods under capitalism. \nLenin's reaction to Taylor's 'scientific management' was negative \n(and it was only after the Bolsheviks had seized power in the October \nRevolution that he started to perceive Taylorism's advantages). Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. In photographs, Lenin was \nalways neatly dressed. It was almost de rigueur for Marxist leaders \nfrom Russia to wear three-piece suits, and knee-length overcoats \nwere usual on cold days. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. For most of his career before the February Revolution of \n1917, Lenin had to live in rented rooms, and fairly cheap rented \nrooms at that. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. The young Bolshevik, V. Karpinski knew \nthat Lenin, as an economist, divided the Russian peasantry into poor \npeasants, middle peasants and kulaks. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money.219 Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. He justifiably thought of himself as a leading Marxist \npolitical writer. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Consequently_Lenin_1910": " 1 All or Nothing: \n1910-1912 \nCONFLICTS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nThe political life of Vladimir Ilich Lenin was avidly scrutinised by the \nsubjects of the former Russian empire from 1917, and foreign \npoliticians and commentators strove to stay abreast of his career. The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in 1910, none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:1d in store for him. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility. 1 In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. Liquidators \nand Ultimatumists were detested equally by Lenin, who wanted both \na strengthening of the illegal committees and the flexible use of the \nDuma as a forum for party propaganda. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party.3 \n All or Nothing \n3 \nImmediately after the plenum, Lenin started to pick the locks. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. He announced \nthat the Bolsheviks would re-establish a factional organ, which he \nwanted to call The Workers' Newspaper. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. \nMany fellow Bolsheviks among the Marxist emigres distrusted his \nintense anti-Menshevism, and these still desired party unity. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. 17 \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. \nLenin punched back. Again Lenin aimed his blows low.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all. Trotski's emigre journalism, with \narticles excoriating the 'Leninists' for their intransigence and \nsectarianism, increased his influence.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. This was not Lenin's conscious intention. 27 Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance. 29 Trotski's ideas were distorted \nby his Bolshevik critics: he continued to assert that both violent and \npeaceful political methods ought to be undertaken by the party. 30 \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept.31 \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. The resistance to Lenin's \nonslaughts in the following months was bound to be weaker; and the \ncomposition of the forthcoming Party Conference was ever likelier to \nproduce a triumph for him. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom.43 \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication.44 \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May 1911 meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices.45 He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted.48 \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin.49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. Lenin \nwas an inveterate pedagogue and spoke in the characteristic pose of a \nschoolmaster, with thumbs pressed hard into the armholes of his \nwaistcoat. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. 55 Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. Even under the regime of Nikolai II, \nhe sounded an exultant note: 'The party is the conscious, progressive \nlayer of a class, its vanguard.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'. 60 \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless;61 and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition.68 But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug.69 This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n11 \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.'70 Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. Instead he \ntalked about the destiny of 'the proletariat', not about his own; and \nhe tried to submerge his identity in the cause of the Marxist \nrevolutionary movement, proclaiming that 'we, the workers' were \nmarching towards a world socialist order. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole.73 In vain Lenin put the following proposition to \nhim: 'One cannot sit between two stools; it's a matter of being either \nfor or against the Liquidators'.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'. 77 Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption. Lenin had written fly-sheets for workers in the \n1890s; and his pamphlet 'To the Village Poor' in 1900 was a model of \nits kind.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted.85 It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence.87 Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A.88 Lenin had made no such retraction; on the contrary, he \nhad asserted that the new figures bolstered his original case. The \nepisode is yet another sign that Lenin's ideas could be understood in \nways diametrically opposite to those which he really held (and that \nthis was not a phenomenon peculiar to the years after his death); it \nalso shows that the Bolsheviks were not devoid of theorists such as \nFinn-Enotaevski who already perceived that rural life was more \ncomplex than as portrayed by the Lenin of the 1890s. \nSuch realism among Bolsheviks came to the fore only after 1921, \nwhen an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt pushed Lenin into introducing \na New Economic Policy granting large economic and social \nconcessions to the peasantry. \nIn the years immediately before 1917, Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. 93 Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. Yet the substance of his commentary signalled a \nshift of emphasis in his interpretation of Russian economic condi-\ntions. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.97 Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry.98 The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. \nLenin scathingly pointed out that innumerable Russian firms and \ntheir owners profited from the influx of alien capital; and he urged \nthat those Duma deputies who played the 'patriotic' card should \nhave their stocks and shares investigated to see whether they stood to \nbenefit from a change in the regime's financial policy. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. It seems a significant lapse for a writer with the special \nbias towards the 'proletariat' that being a Marxist involves. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state. This, in Lenin's \n All or Nothing \n17 \npresentation, was a form of 'Bonapartism'.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. 107 Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. 111 At its core were Lenin's speculations on the reasons why \nthe Kadets, as the leading liberal party, acquired so few seats. The newly ultra-right political complexion of the \nparliamentary chamber, according to Lenin, was the product of the \ncalculations and manipulations of the authorities. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. 114 \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n1911, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad. 117 \n All or Nothing \n19 \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. He and his friends \ndiscerned that Lenin aimed to reconstruct a Central Committee \nunder his personal control and, by means of the Conference, claim \nthat it presided over the entire party. 120 \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. Two \nrepresentatives from Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks turned up and \nstayed, and Ordzhonikidze was used by Lenin as his 'expert' in \nhandling them at the Conference. No other faction except the \nBolsheviks and the Party Mensheviks was present. 121 For most \npurposes, the Prague Conference, which the Bolsheviks dubbed the \nSixth Party Conference, was a Bolshevik Factional Conference. 122 \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. Worse \nstill, from Lenin's viewpoint, was the fact that six delegates had come \nunder the assumption that other factions were being invited. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists. 123 Ordzhoni-\nkidze informed fellow delegates that Lenin might walk out if the \nrecipients of these late invitations turned up. 124 Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 128 \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n21 \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. 132 Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 133 Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable. 142 Ordzhonikidze took offence, especially at Lenin's \ninsinuation that the anti-emigre noises were merely tearful laments. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. 146 Lenin \nstressed that such organisations need not be tightly-structured. 147 Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. 148 \nGoloshchekin concurred with the Menshevik speaker, adding that \nLenin had painted an 'idealistic picture'. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. \nLenin advised the replacement of a clause which embodied outright \nopposition to the elective principle in party work; his grounds were \nnot philosophical but those of political tact. 154 Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 155 In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. 156 Lenin also successfully urged \nthe Conference to insist that the party's deputies in the State Duma \nshould denounce the Kadets more vigorously and should accentuate \nthe slogans of a democratic republic, the eight-hour day, and \nconfiscation of gentry-owned land. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. 160 \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. 163 Secondly, many of the \n'Leninists' had criticised the emigres at the Conference; and they \nincluded newly-elected members of the Central Committee Ordzho-\nnikidze, Spandaryan and Goloshchekin. 164 \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. 172 Disagreements \nbetween Lenin and Leo Jogiches, the Polish social-democratic leader, \nwere of long standing. At the Second Party Congress, in 1903, Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg, instructing their \nrepresentatives at the Congress by letter, argued that Polish \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindependence was an irrelevance in a capitalist world which was \nmaking economic nonsense of all frontiers. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart \nin 1907 Luxemburg, Martov and Lenin collaborated closely. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. And it \nannoyed Lenin, but not to the point of rupture; indeed he came, in \n1917, to see the uses of deploying a programmatic slogan very similar \nto that of Jogiches. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. 183 Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. 184 Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. 185 \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. 197 \nThe political friendship of Lenin and this handful of leading Polish \nsocial-democrats helped to deflect attention from the most remark-\nable consequence of the Prague Conference: namely the fact that the \nterritorial base of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party- or \nat least the part of it led by Lenin - had diminished. \nSince neither the Jewish Bund nor the Social-Democracy of the \nLatvian Region had agreed to join Lenin's venture in Prague (and \nLenin had not given them an invitation in any event. 199 \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'. Those Poles who stayed as his allies were destined to play a \nrole alongside Lenin in the realignment of forces within the European \nsocialist left in the First World War. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-1914. 201 But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in 1914; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in 1915-16,202 and, in 1917, \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.204 Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. The extraordinary feature of Lenin's treatment was its \nnear-metaphysical lack of doubt in Marx and Engels; no prominent \nMarxist gave so overtly unquestioning a commitment. \nLenin fought for Marx as his 'teacher', but chose carefully where \nto make a stand. It was consequently utopian for \nMarxists to think th<ti patterns of government could be drastically \ntransformed by political revolution.209 Lenin held back from \nthe fray.210 \nBut a thinker's quality is revealed as much by his silences as by his \nstatements; and Lenin's failure to address the pertinent questions \nraised by Michels and Weber damages his reputation as a political \ntheorist even for his own epoch.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.212 But the comment presumably seemed \nto Lenin, on reflection, too much like a retreat; and he added that \nGerman wages were not rising in real value and that inflation was \nsoaring more steeply.13 This could have constituted a return to the \nfirst version of Marx's immiseration theory; but Lenin refrained from \nproposing the trend as a general norm. \nMarx exhilarated him, and those studies of Lenin which entirely \ndeny his Marxist commitment are profoundly erroneous.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era.215 Lenin did not foresee the mass purchases of electrical \ngoods under capitalism. \nLenin's reaction to Taylor's 'scientific management' was negative \n(and it was only after the Bolsheviks had seized power in the October \nRevolution that he started to perceive Taylorism's advantages). Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. In photographs, Lenin was \nalways neatly dressed. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. The young Bolshevik, V. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money.219 Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. He justifiably thought of himself as a leading Marxist \npolitical writer. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Vladimir_Ilich_Lenin_1910": " 1 All or Nothing: \n1910-1912 \nCONFLICTS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nThe political life of Vladimir Ilich Lenin was avidly scrutinised by the \nsubjects of the former Russian empire from 1917, and foreign \npoliticians and commentators strove to stay abreast of his career. The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in 1910, none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:1d in store for him. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party.3 \n All or Nothing \n3 \nImmediately after the plenum, Lenin started to pick the locks. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. 17 \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. \nLenin punched back. Again Lenin aimed his blows low.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all. Trotski's emigre journalism, with \narticles excoriating the 'Leninists' for their intransigence and \nsectarianism, increased his influence.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. This was not Lenin's conscious intention.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance. 30 \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class.43 \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication.44 \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May 1911 meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices. Serge Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the \nRussian Organisational Commission, chose agents to accompany \nhim to Russia to make the arrangements.45 He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted.48 \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin.49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Ordzhonikidze, I. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. Lenin \nwas an inveterate pedagogue and spoke in the characteristic pose of a \nschoolmaster, with thumbs pressed hard into the armholes of his \nwaistcoat. He delivered fifty-six lectures at Longjumeau, his topics \nincluding general disquisitions on political economy as well as more \ndetailed offerings on his favourite theme: the agrarian question in the \nRussian empire. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. \nOrdzhonikidze and his fellow Longjumeau graduates, Breslav and \nShvarts, who were working for the Russian Organisational Commis-\nsion, found widespread 'disarray' and 'collapse'. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. 55 Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. The fact \nthat in I91 0 there were only about I 0,000 organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions, 56 did not depress him.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'. 60 \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless;61 and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition.68 But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug.69 This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n11 \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.'70 Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'. His self-\nconfidence was accompanied by an intolerance bolstered by the \nintrospective conditions of the emigre disputes that typified the \nRussian revolutionary movement. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole.73 In vain Lenin put the following proposition to \nhim: 'One cannot sit between two stools; it's a matter of being either \nfor or against the Liquidators'.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'. 77 Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. \nRussian public discussion was effervescent in books, journals and \nnewspapers. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them. There is no trace in \nLenin's writings of the gossip about the empress Aleksandra, and he \nsaid little even about the self-styled 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted.85 It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence.87 Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A.88 Lenin had made no such retraction; on the contrary, he \nhad asserted that the new figures bolstered his original case. \nIn the years immediately before 1917, Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique. Karl Kautsky's works were read assiduous-\nly; and Lenin admired his attacks on Eduard David, who argued \nagainst Marx's assumption that large-scale capitalist agricultural \nestates might not turn out to be as competitive on the world market \nas small, owner-occupied farms.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming. The parallel with the \nRussian empire was close.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. 93 Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.97 Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry.98 The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. 107 Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. 114 \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n1911, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. Serebryakov and B. Ordzhonikidze blatantly \naspired to the arrangement of a Bolshevik-dominated Conference; he \ninvited a few Party Mensheviks (who were close to Plekhanov and \nopposed Martov's gentleness with the so-called Liquidators), but \nonly with the purpose of giving the impression that the Conference \nwas more open to the party as a whole than it really would be. He and his friends \ndiscerned that Lenin aimed to reconstruct a Central Committee \nunder his personal control and, by means of the Conference, claim \nthat it presided over the entire party. 120 \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. Two \nrepresentatives from Plekhanov's Party Mensheviks turned up and \nstayed, and Ordzhonikidze was used by Lenin as his 'expert' in \nhandling them at the Conference. 122 \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. These \ndelegates, including some of Lenin's professed sympathisers, sent \nlast-minute invitations to the non-Russian 'national parties' within \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party as well as to the emigre \nnewspapers of Trotski, Plekhanov and the Vperedists. 123 Ordzhoni-\nkidze informed fellow delegates that Lenin might walk out if the \nrecipients of these late invitations turned up. 124 Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 128 \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n21 \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. 132 Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 133 Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable. 142 Ordzhonikidze took offence, especially at Lenin's \ninsinuation that the anti-emigre noises were merely tearful laments. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours.' Goloshchekin took Ordzhonikidze's side. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. 146 Lenin \nstressed that such organisations need not be tightly-structured. 147 Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. 148 \nGoloshchekin concurred with the Menshevik speaker, adding that \nLenin had painted an 'idealistic picture'. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. 154 Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 155 In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. 160 \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. 163 Secondly, many of the \n'Leninists' had criticised the emigres at the Conference; and they \nincluded newly-elected members of the Central Committee Ordzho-\nnikidze, Spandaryan and Goloshchekin. 164 \nOnly two emigres, in fact, belonged to the Central Committee: \nLenin and Zinoviev. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. 172 Disagreements \nbetween Lenin and Leo Jogiches, the Polish social-democratic leader, \nwere of long standing. At the Second Party Congress, in 1903, Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. Leo Jogiches and Rosa Luxemburg, instructing their \nrepresentatives at the Congress by letter, argued that Polish \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindependence was an irrelevance in a capitalist world which was \nmaking economic nonsense of all frontiers. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. At the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart \nin 1907 Luxemburg, Martov and Lenin collaborated closely. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. 183 Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. 184 Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. 185 \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. In his own organisation, Jogiches was as author-\nitarian and intolerant as Lenin and he entirely lacked the Bolshevik \nleader's more attractive personal qualities. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. \nSince neither the Jewish Bund nor the Social-Democracy of the \nLatvian Region had agreed to join Lenin's venture in Prague (and \nLenin had not given them an invitation in any event. 199 \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Iosif Stalin and Sergo \nOrdzhonikidze were Georgians; Y. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'. Those Poles who stayed as his allies were destined to play a \nrole alongside Lenin in the realignment of forces within the European \nsocialist left in the First World War. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-1914. 201 But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in 1914; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in 1915-16,202 and, in 1917, \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.204 Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. \nLenin fought for Marx as his 'teacher', but chose carefully where \nto make a stand.209 Lenin held back from \nthe fray.210 \nBut a thinker's quality is revealed as much by his silences as by his \nstatements; and Lenin's failure to address the pertinent questions \nraised by Michels and Weber damages his reputation as a political \ntheorist even for his own epoch.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist. \nMarx exhilarated him, and those studies of Lenin which entirely \ndeny his Marxist commitment are profoundly erroneous.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era.215 Lenin did not foresee the mass purchases of electrical \ngoods under capitalism. Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. In photographs, Lenin was \nalways neatly dressed. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. For most of his career before the February Revolution of \n1917, Lenin had to live in rented rooms, and fairly cheap rented \nrooms at that. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. The young Bolshevik, V. Karpinski knew \nthat Lenin, as an economist, divided the Russian peasantry into poor \npeasants, middle peasants and kulaks. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money.219 Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Party_Organisations_1910": " 8 \nHis demand was aimed at abrogating the arrangements made at the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee.21 The endless \ndisputes after the Central Committee plenum of January 1910 \ndemonstrated that a comprehensive examination of the party's \ncondition was necessary. Meanwhile a Russian Organisational Commission \nwas to direct the party in the Russian empire. The \nOctobrists, who wished to work again for an alliance between \nthemselves and the government, were the largest group, with 94 \nseats; and the next biggest was constituted by parties even further to \nthe political right. 143 \nThis particular suggestion was rejected; but so, too, was Zinoviev's \nmotion on 'party organisation abroad', which embodied an attempt \nto provide the Committee of the Foreign Organisation with complete \napprova1. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. Thus foreign-based party organisations were required to \nrally round not the Committee of the Foreign Organisation but the \nCentral Committee. At the Fourth Party Congress in \nApril 1906 an agreement was reached, and the Polish social-\ndemocrats entered the larger party with rights of autonomy in the \nterritory covered by its existing organisations and with automatic \nrepresentation in the central party apparatus. 198 The 'party' \ncould no longer properly claim to have organisations in Poland. \nNor did the Armenian organisations, which had been affiliated to the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party since 1907, attend.", "Bolshevik_Ambition_1910": " 1 All or Nothing: \n1910-1912 \nCONFLICTS IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nThe political life of Vladimir Ilich Lenin was avidly scrutinised by the \nsubjects of the former Russian empire from 1917, and foreign \npoliticians and commentators strove to stay abreast of his career. The natural reflex of \ncontemporaries was to enquire what sort of man had led the \nBolshevik march on power. Few observers \ndoubted that the main inspirer of the October Revolution was Lenin. \nHis declaration that the era of European socialist revolution was \nimminent, and that the Bolsheviks of Russia would inaugurate it, \ncaused ubiquitous frissons of excitement. \nAnd yet seven years earlier, in 1910, none of Lenin's contempor-\naries had any presentiment of what the future ht:1d in store for him. \nBefore the First World War his name had become a synonym, among \nRussian revolutionaries, for intolerance. It had crossed nobody's mind that Lenin would soon \nbe a realistic contender for supreme power in his native land. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had not expressed such a thought; he had not even given the \nimpression that a pan-European socialist revolution was an imminent \npossibility. 1 In the pre-war days his priority had been to exert \nauthority within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks were not explicitly censured, but were asked to \ndismantle their separate factional centre. \nBolsheviks were to desist from their polemics against the Liquidators \nand the Ultimatumists. Liquidators \nand Ultimatumists were detested equally by Lenin, who wanted both \na strengthening of the illegal committees and the flexible use of the \nDuma as a forum for party propaganda. 2 \nOther Bolsheviks at the plenum had not demurred at the plenum's \ndecisions. On the contrary, they too hoped that Lenin would mend \nhis ways. But they had not gone through the learning process of an \nall-out contest with Lenin. But all of them recognised that the alternative was to do \nnothing at all, and allow Lenin to call them splitters and enemies of \nthe party. Lenin contrived to imply that the \nMenshevik leaders had overturned the plenum's resolution. He announced \nthat the Bolsheviks would re-establish a factional organ, which he \nwanted to call The Workers' Newspaper. 7 Publication began on 30 \nOctober 1910 and, under Lenin's control, an open struggle was \nresumed against all opponents of Bolshevism. \nNot even this satisfied Lenin. \nMany fellow Bolsheviks among the Marxist emigres distrusted his \nintense anti-Menshevism, and these still desired party unity. It was a tactical finesse that Lenin \nscorned.9 Only a few close supporters, such as Grigori Zinoviev \nwanted an organisational split, and even he was far from approving \nthe whole gamut of Lenin's proposals to deal with non-Bolshevik \ngroups in the party. Now, at Central Committee \nmeetings, they beheld the delicious spectacle of Bolsheviks har-\nanguing their leader. 11 To be sure, Lenin's position strengthened in \nthe course of 1910. But this was small satisfaction for him; he had \n 4 \nLenin: ~ Political Life \nsurged back only to where he had been in 1909 - hardly a year he \nrecalled with pleasure. 12 \nIn the emigration as well as in the Russian empire, moreover, the \nfeeling persisted that greater attention should be paid to activity and \npropaganda in Russia. Lenin was regarded as one of those many \nemigres whose Alpine disputations distracted the party from its \nobjective of making revolution in St Petersburg. 13 The Russian \nsecret police undertook sophisticated measures to hunt down leading \nrevolutionaries. In autumn 1910, two Bolshevik members of the \nCentral Committee fell into their clutches. The Central Committee \nhad created an inner subcommittee, the Russian Bureau, to direct its \naffairs from inside the empire; and two further Bolsheviks belonging \nto it were arrested at the end of the same year. 14 Bolsheviks remained \non the Central Committee, but none of these were enthusiasts for \nLenin's factionalism. As Lenin ruefully noted, they were Bolshevik \nConciliators. 17 \nAnd, although Lenin wished the Bolsheviks to form a separate party, \nit was as yet impolitic to articulate such a desire. Its membership in emigration contained more \nBolsheviks than Mensheviks, and Lenin presumably counted upon \nwinning some Conciliators to his side. \nLenin punched back. Again Lenin aimed his blows low.20 \n All or Nothing \n5 \nThe Okhrana's ability to set one faction against another in the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party by a judiciously selective \npolicy of arrests should not be underestimated; but Lenin's imputa-\ntion of deliberate connivance by the Mensheviks was scandalous. Lenin wanted it in \norder to aggravate disputes and insulate all Bolsheviks from the rest \nof the party; the other leaders, from the Mensheviks through to the \nBolshevik Conciliators, desired it so as to eliminate factionalism once \nand for all.22 It was little relief to Lenin \nthat his opponent had no organised followers in Russia. \nConsequently Lenin inveighed against him more than any other \nRussian Marxist, in 1910-11 23 accusing him of 'adventurism'. This was not Lenin's conscious intention. 27 Trotski saw that this would constitute only a 'partial' \nreform of the political system; but, unlike the Bolsheviks, he argued \nthat a 'petition campaign' would enhance the standing of socialism \namidst the working class.28 According to Lenin and Zinoviev, such a \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstandpoint merely brought Trotski together with the Liquidators in \nan unholy and unprincipled alliance. 29 Trotski's ideas were distorted \nby his Bolshevik critics: he continued to assert that both violent and \npeaceful political methods ought to be undertaken by the party. 30 \nAnd yet he would have stood a better chance of inhibiting Lenin's \ndisruptiveness if the Mensheviks had not been so inept. No Menshevik leader was willing to repeat \nwhat they regarded as the charade of January 1910.31 \nThe Bolsheviks, for neither the first not the last time, were being \nhelped by the voluntary exodus of their enemies. Meanwhile a Russian Organisational Commission \nwas to direct the party in the Russian empire. 32 The Bolshevik \nConciliator, A. The resistance to Lenin's \nonslaughts in the following months was bound to be weaker; and the \ncomposition of the forthcoming Party Conference was ever likelier to \nproduce a triumph for him. \nTHE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY IN \nRUSSIA \nNo organisational commotion was worthwhile even to Lenin unless \nthere was hope of revolutionary unrest in the Russian empire; and, \nfor Marxists, expectations centred on the industrial working class. \nThe Bolshevik ambition to use the legal labour movement as a means \nof communicating with and guiding the working class was still only \nweakly realised. But the Okhrana found it no more difficult to \ncrush such endeavours than it had done with Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party.42 \nBolsheviks saw that the opportunities for political advance were \nnone the less increasing; and the need to enhance involvement in the \nlabour movement, both legal and illegal, was conventional wisdom.43 \nLenin was no better informed about the increasing unrest than any \nother emigre leader. The reunification of the various factions in \nWestern Europe had deprived him of a separate agency of commu-\n 8 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnication. Bolshevik activists moved between Russia and the emigra-\ntion; but it was generally agreed that the Okhrana had shattered \nmany of the old links.44 \nLenin's objective was to use the instrumentalities available since \nthe May 1911 meeting of the Central Committee to convoke a Party \nConference; and to ensure that the Conference should take place \nentirely under Bolshevik auspices. He was convinced that a tightly-\ncentralised party offered the best chance to take advantage of \nRussian labour unrest.45 He was far from merely \nbeing Lenin's stooge. While being enthusiastic about the idea of a \nConference, he disliked Lenin's preoccupation with the intrigues of \nemigre politics.46 A Russian political focus and geographical base of \nwork was Ordzhonikidze's aim, and his opinions were shared by \ncountless Bolshevik underground activists.47 The fact that Lenin had \nrepeatedly called for the maintenance of the illegal party apparatus \ndid not assuage their resentment (and Lenin was as yet protected \nagainst their wrath only by the police's effectiveness in severing \ncontact between Russia and the emigration). Lenin's qualities as a \npropagandist were accepted.48 \nNot that anyone entirely denied the contribution made by Lenin.49 The aim \nwas to select promising undergrounders, pay their passage out from \nRussia and offer them intensive lecture-courses on Marxism and \nparty strategy before releasing them back to their underground \nduties. Not all of them were Leninists. Shvarts \nand Boris Breslav were among the ten Bolshevik activists who \nattended as students alongside members of the other factions. 50 \nFurthermore, the condition of the underground committees was so \ndire that no one could reasonably turn Lenin into the sole scapegoat. \nOrdzhonikidze and his fellow Longjumeau graduates, Breslav and \nShvarts, who were working for the Russian Organisational Commis-\nsion, found widespread 'disarray' and 'collapse'.52 Contacts between one town committee and another \nwere minimal; and even within towns there were few ties among the \nvarious Bolshevik groups. 53 So were Lenin's interfactional polemics \ncompletely irrational. 54 \nFor Lenin, such initiatives would deflect Marxists from taking proper \nadvantage of the resurgence of labour unrest. 55 Thus Lenin saw himself as a super-optimist. The fact \nthat in I91 0 there were only about I 0,000 organised Russian \nMarxists, including all the various factions, 56 did not depress him.' 57 \nLenin also adduced the history of the German Social-Democratic \nParty as evidence. And Lenin proclaimed that in Russia, \ntoo, 'a small party core' exercised 'an extraordinarily strong influence \nover the vast masses of the workers'.59 Already, too, the Russian \nworking class had accomplished wonders in less than two decades. 60 \nTrotski retorted that, if it did not really matter that so few party \nmembers existed, Lenin's rancour and schismatism in the party's \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \naffairs was all the more pointless;61 and others, too, maintained that, \nwhile the Liquidators were misguided to rely exclusively on legal \noperations, Lenin was exhibiting a sectarian obsessiveness. Several Bolshevik groups in Russian drew \nthe same conclusion. Ordzhonikidze, for example, reported approvingly that \nBolshevik groups in the capital had been collaborating with \nUltimatumists.65 This was bad enough from Lenin's viewpoint \n(although he knew nothing about it until later, since communica-\ntions had broken down). Worse still was the situation in Samara, \nwhere Bolsheviks and Liquidators co-operated. \nLike almost all Russian Marxists, Lenin ridiculed this intellectual \ntradition.68 But Lenin's adversaries claimed that, even if unknowingly, \nhe had ingested the Nietzschean drug.69 This was exaggeration (but no worse than the exaggerated \nprosecutions that Lenin brought against his victims). \nAnd yet his associate Zinoviev, while denying that Lenin was either \negocentric or dictatorial, confided the following considerations to his \n All or Nothing \n11 \nnotebook: 'But did he have a consciousness (a sensation) that he had \nbeen 'called'. Without this he would not have become \nLenin.'70 Zinoviev conceded that, in the period when Lenin was \nstruggling for political 'recognition', the relationship of individuals \nwith 'him personally (i. \nIndeed, according to Zinoviev's revealing memoir, Lenin felt himself \n'responsible for the whole of humanity' and saw himself as 'the leader \n(in the best sense of the word) of the working class and the party'. His self-\nconfidence was accompanied by an intolerance bolstered by the \nintrospective conditions of the emigre disputes that typified the \nRussian revolutionary movement. Even so, Lenin's willingness to \nsplit his faction again and again went beyond the norm. 72 \nYet this verbal flourish did not convince the Bolshevik deputies to \nthe Third State Duma. Poletaev, \nwho tried to persuade Lenin to moderate his anti-Liquidator \ncampaign. Lenin was angry; but, located in the emigration and \nlacking any sanction to compel Poletaev's obedience, he could only \npersuade and cajole.74 \nPoletaev, a fitter by trade and the Duma deputy for St Petersburg \nprovince, could also incommode Lenin politically. His seat in the \nDuma gave him a degree of immunity from arrest, and he was able to \ntake an active role in the editing of the Bolshevik legal journal The \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nStar. Without Poletaev's permission, Lenin's articles would remain \nunpublished. 75 In addition, Poletaev believed that the surest way to \noutmatch the Liquidators in the capital was to establish a Bolshevik \ndaily newspaper. \nDespite his theoretical support for the exploiting of all legal as well \nas illegal opportunities, Lenin was not keen. In a rare confession of his intention to \nbreak with the Mensheviks, Lenin stated that unification 'with \nMensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless'. 77 Lenin also \nclaimed, mistakenly, that increased repression of the press was in \nthe offing; and not too subtly he tried to dissuade Gorki from \nsubsidising Poletaev's scheme. The failure to support \nPoletaev was consonant with Lenin's reluctance to write articles for \npopular consumption.80 Lenin's dream of a tightly co-ordinated and centralised \nparty was as distant from fulfilment as ever. A St Petersburg daily newspaper would rob \nWorkers' Newspaper, printed in Paris, of its usefulness to the illegal \nBolshevik organisations in Russia; and Lenin's influence would \ndecline. \n All or Nothing \n13 \nTHOUGHTS ON RUSSIA \nLenin's isolation in the West was not all his own fault; it was also the \nprice paid by all emigres for their freedom. \nRussian public discussion was effervescent in books, journals and \nnewspapers. Lenin kept up with current publications, and himself \ncontributed to them. There is no trace in \nLenin's writings of the gossip about the empress Aleksandra, and he \nsaid little even about the self-styled 'holy man' Grigori Rasputin. He \ncontinued to study Russian economic development, and to ponder \nthe implications for the struggle between social classes.83 According to Lenin, \nRussia's internal market would therefore remain needlessly restricted.85 It must be added that \nLenin was doing little other than expressing the conventional \ncontemporary wisdom among revolutionaries about the govern-\nment's strategy in the countryside; and that he was very far from \nthinking that Marxists had to hasten their accession to power for fear \nthat the programme of Stolypin might succeed. Petr Maslov had \nceased to worry himself with what Lenin wrote; he had either gained \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhis own confidence over the years, or had decided that there was no \npoint in aiming criticisms at a Lenin who had resolved to ignore \nincommodious empirical data. Cherevanin entered the \ncontroversy, claiming that Lenin had never answered those critics \nof his Development of Capitalism in Russia who had stated that his \nstatistics did not conclusively demonstrate his contention that an \ninter-generational process of differentiation of the peasantry into \nrival classes of rural bourgeoisie and rural proletariat was in \nexistence.87 Lenin ignored Cherevanin. It was left to another \nBolshevik, A. The \nepisode is yet another sign that Lenin's ideas could be understood in \nways diametrically opposite to those which he really held (and that \nthis was not a phenomenon peculiar to the years after his death); it \nalso shows that the Bolsheviks were not devoid of theorists such as \nFinn-Enotaevski who already perceived that rural life was more \ncomplex than as portrayed by the Lenin of the 1890s. \nSuch realism among Bolsheviks came to the fore only after 1921, \nwhen an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt pushed Lenin into introducing \na New Economic Policy granting large economic and social \nconcessions to the peasantry. \nIn the years immediately before 1917, Lenin's main initiative in the \nfield of economic theory lay in his comparisons of the features of \nagricultural development in Russia and the USA. It irritated him \nthat, over a decade after the publication of his Development of \nCapitalism, many commentators persisted in imagining that Russia's \npre-capitalist social vestiges made her unique.90 Lenin again opted to \n All or Nothing \n15 \nremain discreetly silent, filling his notebooks before and after the \n1905-6 revolution with data on German and Danish farming. The parallel with the \nRussian empire was close.92 Georgi Plekhanov, Petr Maslov and Lev \nTrotski in their books on Russian economic development had \nemphasised the sui generis path taken in Russia; and Trotski in \nparticular had stressed the coexistence of backward peasant villages \nand highly-advanced large-scale factories. 93 Lenin delighted in \narguing that such phenomena coexisted elsewhere. \nThere were, he said, two bourgeoisies in Russia. Lenin saw it as a ruling class. The second by contrast was 'broad': its members were mostly \npeasants, and Lenin stressed that it had not reached maturity. Yet the substance of his commentary signalled a \nshift of emphasis in his interpretation of Russian economic condi-\ntions. 'In Russian capitalism,' he proclaimed before the First \nWorld War, 'the features of Asiatic primitiveness, bureaucratic \nbribery and deals by financiers sharing their monopolistic incomes \nwith leading civil servants are still boundlessly strong. \nLenin now scorned economists claiming too much for Russian \nindustrial progress. Ermanski, comparing Russian and German official statistics, \nconcluded in 1912 that the concentration of capital in Russian \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindustry was greater than in Germany.97 Lenin revelled in pulling \nanother economist's data to bits; he indicated that Ermanski failed to \ninclude the output of home-based workers and artisans in his \narithmetic for Russia; and that he consequently overrated the \nmodernity of her industry.98 The criticism was perceptive, but also \nmarked the limitations of Lenin's own economic enquiries.99 At least until 1914, Lenin portrayed \nindustrial production as falling under the control of a united class. In 1912, newspapers in \nRussia were exercised by one of their recurrent debates about foreign \ncapitalist penetration and domination; xenophobia was rampant. 100 \nAnd yet the very strangest gap in Lenin's pre-war writings lay \nelsewhere. Lenin wanted a revolution and wanted all \nworkers to take part in it; he may well have felt that the image of a \nworking class displaying a variety of skills, material conditions and \naspirations would have impeded his general objective. \nNor did Lenin do much to sharpen his recent ideas on the changing \nnature of the Russian imperial state.' 105 Lenin ridiculed \nthe notion of fellow Bolshevik M. \nThus Lenin's analysis was starting to entwine itself with a \nvenerable strand in Russian socialist, liberal and even some \nconservative intellectual thought from the previous century. 107 Lenin's reconsiderations should there-\nfore serve as a warning against the belief that his thought before the \nFirst World War was internally wholly consistent. 108 Moreover, his \nremark showed an awareness of the huge and independent power \nthat a ruthless state might wield in the teeth of much public hostility; \nand his actions after the October Revolution of 1917 exemplified his \nown willingness to deploy such power if the opportunity came his \nway.1o9 \nTHE PRAGUE CONFERENCE \nAt any rate, Lenin said little and published less on the topic of the \nRussian imperial state; and, apart from Olminski's book, it was \nmany years before Marxists in general began to tackle the thorny \nquestions of the forms and intricacies of state power. Savelev in 1911 requesting data on the \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelectoral procedures used for the Third State Duma in 1907. The Russian \nempire bestrode a superficially modified autocracy. 114 \nLenin's 'conspiracy theory' of the Fourth Duma elections divulged \nmuch about his own instincts about elections and majorities.115 The convoking organs were the new Foreign and Russian \nOrganisational Commissions. Lenin made a cobra-like attack upon \nthe Bolshevik Conciliators. \nLenin arranged with Sergo Ordzhonikidze, as leader of the Russian \nOrganisational Commission of the Central Committee, for an \nultimatum to be delivered to the Foreign Organisational Commis-\nsion to place itself under the Russian Organisational Commission's \nsovereignty. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nwas left to its own devices. Lenin gratefully accepted the opportunity \nto call together his emigration-based supporters in Paris in December \n1911, and the consequence was the establishment of a Committee of \nthe Foreign Organisation which was to supplant the Foreign \nOrganisational Commission in co-ordinating all party organisations \nabroad. 117 \n All or Nothing \n19 \nSuch manipulations were blatantly factional; no non-Bolshevik \nwas given a place on the new body. But Lenin calculated that he \nneeded an appearance of procedural legitimacy even if it really was a \ncharade. His objective was the confection of a 'Party Conference' \nwhich would be not merely a predominantly Bolshevik assembly but \nan assembly consisting mainly of Bolsheviks who supported Lenin's \nstrategy. Ordzhoni-\nkidze, a hard-working and ruthless Bolshevik, operated efficiently. \nAssisted by Bolsheviks such as L. Ordzhonikidze blatantly \naspired to the arrangement of a Bolshevik-dominated Conference; he \ninvited a few Party Mensheviks (who were close to Plekhanov and \nopposed Martov's gentleness with the so-called Liquidators), but \nonly with the purpose of giving the impression that the Conference \nwas more open to the party as a whole than it really would be. 120 \nYet the competition for delegates was scarcely intense, not least \nbecause Lenin's Bolsheviks did not want their rivals to come to \nPrague. Nearly all were Bolsheviks. No other faction except the \nBolsheviks and the Party Mensheviks was present. 121 For most \npurposes, the Prague Conference, which the Bolsheviks dubbed the \nSixth Party Conference, was a Bolshevik Factional Conference. 122 \nThis did not mean that it was a Conference made in Lenin's image. \nOrdzhonikidze had had little contact with the emigration while \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngathering delegates in the Russian empire; and, while admiring most \nof Lenin's general policies, he detested his schismatic excesses. Worse \nstill, from Lenin's viewpoint, was the fact that six delegates had come \nunder the assumption that other factions were being invited. 124 Lenin could have \nspared himself his rage. He learnt to accept the presence of \nthe two Party Mensheviks who had arrived under the aegis of \nOrdzhonikidze and the Russian Organisational Commission, since \nthey could not outvote the Bolsheviks. Two Bolsheviks at the Conference, R. 128 \nLuckily for Lenin, neither Malinovski nor Romanov had instruc-\ntions to impede his progress in Prague. Ordzhonikidze based \n All or Nothing \n21 \nhis tactics upon a Conference consisting mainly of Russia-based \nactivists, and Lenin had to listen to P. 132 Ordzhonikidze demonstratively praised the \nanti-Lenin Vpered activists in St Petersburg who had attacked \nMenshevik Liquidators (and he later talked of the possibility of \nrapprochement between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks). 133 Other dele-\ngates, apparently, referred in detail to Lenin's unpleasant polemics \nagainst other Russian Marxists, including even the Bolshevik \nConciliators. 134 Lenin was unbowed. 137 Ordzhonikidze \nagain rubbed salt in his leader's wounds by stating that co-operation \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would be easier if only there did \nnot exist \"'the damned emigration\" and the leaders who, sitting \naround in Paris or San Remo and understanding nothing, write \ndirectives and produce splits. Spandaryan went further, saying that those who \nwanted to do party work should do the work in Russia proper. 140 \nMost of the following debates were focused on the Russian labour \nmovement. Lenin tried to treat it casually: 'Why is this all so \nlaughable. \n'And Lenin,' he declared, 'has not answered a single question of \nours. There was even a \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nproposal, possibly from M. The Central Committee was to be \nbased mostly in Russia: the final resolution defined it pointedly as \n'the Russian centre of social-democratic work'. 145 Everyone, includ-\ning Lenin, agreed that an emphasis on work in the legal channels of \nthe labour movement was required. 147 Zevin, a non-\nBolshevik, was more blunt. He asked how Lenin's recommendation \nfor a party founded mainly upon work in 'legal societies' was \nreconcilable with his demand for intensified struggle with the \nLiquidators; and he charged Lenin with underestimating the real \ndifficulties of even legal activity in the Russian labour movement. And he resented what he \ntook to be Lenin's criticisms of the Bolshevik party activists in \nRussia. 149 Only Onufriev supported Lenin. 150 \nAnd Lenin, perhaps recognising that his advocacy of legal work \nmight continue to be misunderstood, suggested that a clause on the \nneed to strengthen the illegal party apparatus be included in the \nConference resolution on party organisation. 154 Lenin could safely leave such functions to him. \nThe political line followed Lenin's: that 'the party' should put up its \nown candidates in the workers' curiae without pacts with other \nparties. 155 In addition, Lenin \nand Zinoviev persuaded the Conference to oppose the Menshevik-\nsupported campaign to collect signatures for a 'petitition' for the \nright of freedom of association to be granted in Russia. Such a \ncampaign, he declared, was Liquidationist claptrap; and a further \nresolution was passed asserting that the Liquidators had 'definitively \nplaced themselves outside the party' - a device already used by Lenin \nin 1908 to 'expel' Aleksandr Bogdanov from the Bolshevik faction \nwithout using the word expulsion. 159 \nA collective snook was therefore cocked at other factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin's victories on policy \nwere large; and the non-Bolshevik Marxist press quickly reported on \nthe proceedings in such terms. Indeed, many commentators at the \ntime, and many more since 1912, dated the essential formation of a \nBolshevik party from the Prague affair. The formation of a self-\nstyled Central Committee, staffed mainly by pro-Lenin Bolsheviks, \nwas truly a watershed in the history of the Russian Marxist \nmovement. 160 \nYet the Conference delegates did not see themselves as mere \nauxiliaries in Lenin's war. It is usually overlooked that the \nCommittee of the Foreign Organisation, which had been the initial \nchannel for the planning of the Conference and which had been \nespecially important to Lenin in 1911, had been confirmed not as the \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsupreme emigre party body but simply as 'one of the party \norganisations abroad'. But the general \ntendency to fire shafts of warning at Lenin about his future \nbehaviour is transparent in the debates, the resolutions and the \nelections even though Lenin, with characteristic imperturbability, \nended the Conference with a rousing speech. 166 He did not quite stop \nharrying the non-Bolshevik emigres; but he was no longer preoccu-\npied by them after Prague. 167 Seven months had passed since the Bolshevik \nventure in Prague. It is scarcely astounding that Lenin, faced with \nsuch evidence of inefficiency and parlousness, withheld his fire. Apart from hostility to Lenin, nothing \nunited them strongly. They also lacked the Bolshevik understanding \nof the tactical importance of nomenclature. But everyone must have known that the missiles \naimed at Lenin would not wound him. but it was \nconcentrated upon his factionalism: and it certainly did not include \nany criticism of his attitude to the non-Russian constituent parts of \nthe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 171 Lenin was mightily \npleased that he no longer had to worry about the official central \nleadership of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania, which had belonged to the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party (not to mention the Jewish Bund and the Social-\nDemocracy of the Latvian Region) since 1906. 172 Disagreements \nbetween Lenin and Leo Jogiches, the Polish social-democratic leader, \nwere of long standing. At the Second Party Congress, in 1903, Lenin \nand the Iskra group had argued that the subject nations of the \nRomanovs should be offered the right of self-determination. Lenin's refusal to budge \ndiscouraged the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and \nLithuania from joining the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party \nat the Second Congress. 173 Lenin at first did not regret this situation; \nfor the Polish social-democrats objected to Bolshevik attitudes to \nparty organisation, and Luxemburg had entered the Bolshevik-\nMenshevik controversy about the party rules on the Menshevik \nside. There were also good working contacts between Lenin and \nother Polish leaders such as A. 176 As the \ndivisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks deepened over \nstrategy in 1905, Lenin warmed again to talk of the incorporation of \nthe Polish social-democrats of the Romanov empire in the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party. 177 At the Fifth \nCongress in 1907, the Polish social-democrats constituted roughly a \nsixth of the party's entire membership; 178 their radicalism was vital to \nthe success of Bolshevik policies at the Congress. 179 \nNevertheless Polish social-democrats were soon irking Lenin again. And it \nannoyed Lenin, but not to the point of rupture; indeed he came, in \n1917, to see the uses of deploying a programmatic slogan very similar \nto that of Jogiches. 181 Much more serious, for Lenin before the First \n All or Nothing \n27 \nWorld War, was Jogiches's devotion to the retention of Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the same party. Bolshevik organisational \nschismatism was hated by the Poles, and Jogiches would never lend \nsupport to Lenin's calls to exclude the Mensheviks from the central \nparty leadership even though Jogiches opposed Menshevik political \nstrategy. 183 Lenin was \nfrustrated by this. A former section of the Polish Socialist \nParty, the PPS-Lewica, appeared to Lenin to be moving towards a \nMarxist programme; and, unlike Jogiches and the Polish social-\ndemocrats, these socialists were sensitive to the need to embrace the \nnational aspirations of the Polish population. 184 Relations between \nLenin and Jogiches worsened. 185 \nLenin sought pretexts for a definitive conflict with Jogiches. In his own organisation, Jogiches was as author-\nitarian and intolerant as Lenin and he entirely lacked the Bolshevik \nleader's more attractive personal qualities. The split between \nLenin and Jogiches widened in November 1911, when Jogiches \nordered that no Polish social-democrat should any longer serve on \nthe board of Social-Democrat. The decision reflected Jogiches's \nimpatience with the aggressive policies being pursued by the \nBolsheviks in calling a schismatic party conference for January \n1912. By the end of 1911, Jogiches's highhandedness had \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndriven A. Jogiches, \nunlike Lenin, wanted nothing to do with the legal trade unions \nestablished after 1905; and, like Lenin, a growing number of Polish \nsocial-democrats wanted a rapprochement with the left wing segment \nof the Polish Socialist Party. Unszlicht and Karl Radek; and \nthese, too, hoped for closer relations with the Bolsheviks while \nretaining doubts about Lenin's divisive scheming. 192 Jogiches in \n1911 had not totally despaired of dealing with the Lenin problem \nby seeking an accommodation with Bolshevik Conciliators. 195 \nThe fissures in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland \nand Lithuania brought cheer to Lenin, relieving any lingering \ndifficulty in explaining the need for a supposedly unifying Party \nConference in Prague; they also removed a good deal of respons-\nibility for the party split from his shoulders. Until 1912, \nJogiches had interfered more in Russian business than Lenin in the \naffairs of Polish organisations. \nSince neither the Jewish Bund nor the Social-Democracy of the \nLatvian Region had agreed to join Lenin's venture in Prague (and \nLenin had not given them an invitation in any event. \nNor did the Armenian organisations, which had been affiliated to the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party since 1907, attend. 199 \nGeographically, therefore, Lenin's claim to authority was more \nrestricted to Russia proper than before. Many Bolsheviks them-\nselves, of course, were not Russians. Lenin wanted \nfreedom to make his own policies, direct his own organisations, run \nhis own party, and looked on the concessions made to the various \nnational organisations in 1906 as productive of 'federalism of the \nworst sort'. As it happened, Lenin kept most \nof them at arm's length before mid-1914. 201 But it was Hanecki who helped to secure an \nexit visa from Austria-Hungary for Lenin in 1914; it was Radek's \nassistance that meant much to Lenin in the struggle against the \nEuropean 'official' socialist parties in 1915-16,202 and, in 1917, \nHanecki and Radek were a source of information and possibly of \nfunds channelled through to the Bolsheviks from the German \ngovernment.203 \nLEISURE AND ITS DISCONTENTS \nNo longer needing to appease Jogiches, Lenin could write more \nopenly on the 'national question'; and, since Radek and Jogiches \nagreed in their hostility to the slogan of Poland's independence, the \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin-Radek relationship was always tense.204 Lenin, even at his \nmost Machiavellian, was also a man of belief. Marx, for Lenin, was \nbeyond criticism. Lenin evidently needed a rock of certainty in his \nlife. It was consequently utopian for \nMarxists to think th<ti patterns of government could be drastically \ntransformed by political revolution.209 Lenin held back from \nthe fray.211 Lenin, \nfollowing Kautsky and several other Marxist.214 Electricity, too, fascinated Lenin. \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMankind, he felt, stood at the dawn of an era. \nLenin's reaction to Taylor's 'scientific management' was negative \n(and it was only after the Bolsheviks had seized power in the October \nRevolution that he started to perceive Taylorism's advantages). Ignore fashion and have faith, have socialist faith: these were \nLenin's guidelines. \nHe and Nadezhda Krupskaya, like most better-off revolutionaries \nfrom Russia, lived a life that was middle-class in style. While pursuing \nrevolutionary politics, Lenin did not aspire to what might be called a \n'counter-culture'; and in any case it made sense, if he wanted to avoid \ndeportation as a politically undesirable foreigner, to appear as \nconventional and respectable as he could. Lenin wrote out his articles in longhand, and he must have \nwritten very fast if the quantity of published output, notes, drafts and \nexcerpts copied from library books is any guide. The young Bolshevik, V. Lenin, according to Karpins-\nki's only half-joking memoir, operated like a middle peasant. 218 Not being a \n'poor peasant' who had to toil away over a ramshackle Cyrillic \ntypewriter, Lenin nevertheless was not a wealthy kulak-litterateur \nlike Georgi Plekhanov. \nYet Lenin also expected value for money.219 Lenin lived in an age when typesetting and copy-editing \nwas done to a much higher standard than is characteristic today; and \nsince he was dealing with small publishing firms run by fellow \nrevolutionaries he could exert some control over the process of \npublication. Nobody who did not already \nknow would have guessed that his list contained only Bolsheviks.", "Metal_And_Confronted_1917": " This situation \nchanged later in August 1917.", "Bolshevik_Delegates_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.3 Lenin concluded: 'All hopes of a peaceful development of the \nRussian revolution have disappeared definitively.' Now that the \nMenshevik-led soviets had supported the persecution of Bolsheviks \nit was vital to withdraw the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets. The \nneed, according to Lenin, was for nothing less than 'armed \ninsurrection'. 4 \nHis new theses massively overstated the repressive capacity and \nintentions of the Kerenski cabinet: most Bolshevik party organisa-\ntions encountered little harassment. Representatives of the \nparty's localleaderships of Moscow and Petrograd as well as Central \nBureau of the Military Organisation also attended. In demanding the \nabandonment of 'All Power to the Soviets.6 Even the April Party Confer-\nence had given no absolute commitment to rule by soviets;7 and in \nThe State and Revolution, written in the months after the July Days, \nLenin had barely mentioned the soviets. Only Sverdlov fully accepted Lenin's view-\npoint immediately after the July Days.9 The idea that the soviets \nshould be the institutions to deploy revolutionary power had taken a \nhold on the Bolshevik imagination. In addition, the party had \ninvested its energies in persuading workers that 'soviet power' was \nthe noblest objective; and the practical difficulties of justifying \nLenin's proposed change of slogans, when Bolshevik activists spoke \nat open mass meetings, would be considerable. The Central \nCommittee meeting rejected Lenin's invocation by ten votes out of \nfifteen. 10 \nLenin wrote a short article, 'On Slogans', in reply and condemned \nthe Central Committee for what he saw as a lack of tactical \nflexibility.\" 'On Slogans' was published by the Kronstadt \nBolsheviks, and reached a number of activists in the provinces. Lenin's Bolshevik critics may also \nhave been reassured to note that he acknowledged that an immediate \ninsurrection was impracticable.19 A further factor assisting his case \nwas the continued harassment of the Bolsheviks in the capital and the \ncomplicity of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary leaderships. \nSuch a situation must have convinced at least many wavering \nBolsheviks that Lenin's demand for 'All Power to the Soviets. On 26 July 1917, the 157 voting and 107 non-voting \ndelegates convened.20 Lenin and Zinoviev could not risk the journey; \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Trotski, Lunacharski and Kamenev were in prison.21 \nThe decree was not unwelcome to Lenin inasmuch as it dissuaded \nBolshevik critics from continuing to demand that he should deliver \nhimself up to the authorities.23 There is a strong \npossibility that the Central Committee's motion on the political \nsituation, as presented to the Congress by Stalin, was based on a \ndraft handed over by Lenin. And \nthe anti-Bolshevik campaign of the Provisional Government after the \nJuly Days compelled the promotion of less famous members of the \nCentral Committee to greater prominence. His \nmain aim was to show that the Bolshevik leadership had not \nprovoked the clashes on the streets of the capital in early July. But the Moscow-based \nCentral Committee member V. Yet Bukharin acknowledged that, if such a revolution \ndid not break out immediately after the Bolsheviks had taken power \nin Russia, the Russian armed forces might well be incapable of \ntriggering it off by an offensive revolutionary war. In such a \ncontingency, according to Bukharin, the Bolsheviks would have to \nfight a defensive revolutionary war against the Germans.34 Lenin, while sharing Osinski's concern intellectually, \nwould surely have approved of Bukharin's tactful reticence. Why had the strategy of the Bolsheviks changed after the \nFebruary Revolution. A socialist administration, \nhe declared, had been made necessary by the wartime devastation \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand by the refusal of the Russian bourgeoisie, unlike the bourgeoisie \nelsewhere, to accept the desirability of state economic regulation; and \nthe high degree of organisation and morale among Russian workers \nmade such an administration feasible at last. 36 In retrospect, this \nappears a much less light-headed justification for Bolshevism in 1917 \nthan the Europe-centred Marxologisms of Lenin. 37 On the other hand, Stalin as a Bolshevik did not \nagree with Martov that there was any point in expending much \nenergy in persuading the centrist and right-wing Mensheviks that an \nall-socialist government coalition should be formed.

Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. Trotski, who had only recently become a \nBolshevik, now joined the central party leadership. The Bolshevik right, which had been strongly represented in \nthe central party body after the Seventh Conference in April, had lost \nground. \nKERENSKI AND KORNILOV \nDespite the dispute over slogans, no Bolshevik at the Congress gave \nthe impression of expecting to take power in the immediate future. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917. The sole major omission from the list of \nparticipants was the Bolshevik party.69 \nThe immediate effect was to compel Kerenski to muster support \nnot only from Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also \nfrom Bolsheviks. \nThe Bolshevik Central Committee was cock-a-hoop. A counter-\nrevolutionary mutiny had restored them to free activity in the \ncapital; the sole major Bolshevik who could not afford to appear \nin the open was Lenin.70 \nLenin, analysing the events as reported in the press, swung between \ninterpretations. The rising influence of the Mensheviks and \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries induced even Lenin to raise, on 1 \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSeptember, the question of whether a peaceful development of the \nrevolution was possible. In an article, 'On Compromises', he \nsuggested that the Bolsheviks might drop their ideas about a violent \nseizure of power if the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nwould agree to take power for themselves in the name of the soviets. \nThe Bolsheviks would then promise to avoid violence and try to \nobtain power from their rivals by the strength of their persuasion. 74 \nIt was an intriguing phase in Lenin's career. 76 \nLenin, in short, was wavering. By 12 September \nhe was writing 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power' and demanded an \nimmediate uprising; and, on 14 September, he repeated this call in \n'Marxism and Insurrection';77 both documents were letters addressed \nto the Central Committee. His \nfirst justification was that both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets \nhad acquired Bolshevik working majorities earlier in the month.80 Meanwhile, on 13 \nSeptember, the central party newspaper (which had been renamed \nWorker's Path) continued to call for an agreement between the \nBolsheviks and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.82 Kamenev and Trotski, who had both been released \nfrom prison, were nominated as Bolshevik spokesmen and required \nto demand the removal of Kerenski and the installation of a \ngovernment composed entirely of socialists.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Trotski, too, was \nmoving towards such a standpoint and earned a plaudit from Lenin \nfor the taunts he flung at the non-Bolshevik socialists at the \nDemocratic Conference: 'Bravo, comrade Trotski.'84 But even \nTrotski believed that insurrection could not immediately be under-\ntaken, and the Central Committee as a whole resisted Lenin's \nproposal.85 Lenin's discomfiture \nwas emphasised on 16 September by the publication of an article in \nWorker's Path, 'The Russian Revolution and Civil War', which had \n~een written in the brief phase of his support for inter-party \ncompromise. 86 Thus the Central Committee deftly used the prestige \nand authority of 'Lenin' to oppose Lenin. Its members rejected as \nsheer madness his notion that Bolshevik delegates to the Democratic \nConference should walk out, travel to the gates of factories and \nbarracks in the capital and organise an uprising without delay.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. A September Revolution, taking place \nbefore the party held many soviets in Russia, would have been a \ndisaster for Bolshevism. \nTime was really on the Bolshevik party's side. Through the first weeks of October there was a series of \nvictories for the Bolsheviks in elections to the various mass \norganisations. Soviets, trade unions and factory-workshop commit-\ntees were falling into their control.92 \nTo be sure, these pro-Bolshevik voters were not wholly conscious \nof the nature of Bolshevism; and, outside Russia and the Russian-\ndominated cities in the peripheral regions of the old empire, direct \nsupport for the party was minuscule. Lenin's affirmation that 'the \nmajority of the people' favoured the Bolsheviks lacked cogency. The Bolsheviks were continuing to work with the grain \nof popular grievances, and Lenin correctly discerned that the \nopposition to the installation of a socialist government would not \nbe robust. 94 The Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionaries in the \nprovinces still held most soviets. \nLenin's insistence that time was not on the side of the Bolshevik \nparty is therefore hard to explain. \nWe can only guess about Lenin's motives. Lenin wanted a revolution and, surely, he wanted it on \nhis own terms. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. These \nincluded the abolition of a standing army and its replacement by the \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeople under arms; the disbandment of the police; the introduction \nof the elective principle to the civil service and the right of electors to \ninsist on the immediate recall of officials and representatives. 106 By \nany standard this was hyper-confidence; the return to Russia in 1917 \nhad reinforced his sanguine earlier hopes as articulated in 'Marxism \non the State'. But Lenin was writing for \nMarxists, who needed no persuasion on such issues.115 On the other hand, Lenin recognised that \nAnton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Radek had convinc-\n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \ningly exposed Kautsky's 'passive radicalism' before the war.'2\u00b0 Non-Bolsheviks felt no such \ninhibition. 131 \nThey might also have mentioned the Russian agrarian socialist \n~etr Tkachev. 133 \nHis non-Bolshevik critics, however, did not limit themselves to \nMarxology. Moreover, Lenin's \ntwo antagonists did not share the unargued premise of his book that \neach class would gravitate permanently towards support for a single \nparty. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. Yet what \nwas the relationship between such theory and subsequent Russian \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhistory. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Lenin's offering was a strange \nconcoction. All therefore knew of Lenin's \nintentions with the utmost clarity. 149 \nSecondly, Lenin's other writings in 1917 usually avoided suggesting \nthat 'the proletariat' should hold exclusive power. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. The threat of a right-wing military \ndictatorship may well have made him feel that the concept of a \nsocialist dictatorship, which would impose 'order' and 'control' over \nthe middle classes, might have become more respectable amidst \nBolshevik activists; and possibly Kornilovism , ')nvinced even him \nrp. \nIn addition, all those references occurred in the carefully-composed \nprose of Bolshevik newspaper articles and pamphlets. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. Yet the result was that the great mass of workers and \npeasants outside the Bolshevik party can scarcely have known about \nhis full range of plans. This can hardly have been fortuitous; Lenin \ncannot have wanted to upset popular sensibilities unnecessarily, and \nthe virtues of dictatorship would not automatically have commended \nthemselves to the Russian working class. Not only Lenin but also the \nother Bolshevik leaders in the central (and presumably also local) \nnewspapers seldom described their prospective administration as a \n'dictatorship'. The Central Committee's advice to Bolsheviks cam-\npaigning for election to the soviets, published in Pravda on 7 May \n1917, was simply to call for 'all power to the soviets'. And so, whereas the general population - probably \nincluding most rank-and-file Bolsheviks- was unaware of his fiercer \nintentions, careful and regular readers should have picked up the \nmessage. 166 \nLenin, indeed, did not stop short of anticipating the use of 'terror' \nin Russia. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. Lenin wanted the \nlaw changed so that 'the exploiters (i. For most of the year, however, he preferred to avoid the \ntopic altogether or to concentrate on what he described as the terror \nbeing perpetrated against the Bolsheviks by the Provisional Govern-\nment. Before returning to Russia in \n1917, he had scorned those Marxists who called for its convocation \nas a major party goal; but after the February Revolution he \npersistently demanded the Assembly's convocation. 172 In \nLenin's prognosis, the peasants electing deputies to the Constituent \nAssembly (and who would be the majority of the electorate) would be \nto the left of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The 'course and outcome of class struggle', \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nalong with his party's victorious role in that struggle, counted for \nmore. 176 Bolshevik-led mass organisations would therefore constitute \nthe new government whatever the result of the Constituent Assembly \npoll. \nNor was Lenin's willingness to ignore the formally-registered will \nof the majority confined to his ideas about the Assembly: he was no \nmore solicitous as regards the mass organisations. He omitted to \nsay what he would do if this vanguard were to turn against the \nBolsheviks and favour other parties; he had developed no ideas of \nmulti-party competition. The Provisional Government \nand its Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary supporters were \nfearful lest the Bolsheviks should take advantage of its difficulties \n The Fire Next Time \n229 \nwith some of the non-Russian nationalities. Such conflict \nwas grist in Lenin's mill, and after the Seventh Bolshevik Party \nConference he continued to demand that all nations in the old \nRussian empire should be accorded the right of secession. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. Possibly he \nrecognised that the future boundaries of the old imperial state were \nbeyond prediction and that emphatic talk by Bolsheviks about the \nright of secession might induce more secessions than would otherwise \noccur: he explicitly avoided offering a set of 'demands' on behalf of \nspecific nationalities. Leading Bolsheviks privately asked him to \nclarify his policy; but he argued that it was more advisable to limit \nthe party's pronouncements to a simple 'declaration of principles' \n(and even then he published this prevaricatory remark not in a mass-\ncirculation newspaper or at an open mass meeting but in the low-\ncirculation 'thick journal' Enlightenment, which was read mainly by \nBolshevik intellectuals).201 In summary, neither Lenin \nJ:.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. Lenin \ndid precisely that. Lenin did not share this \napocalyptic viewpoint. His \n The Fire Next Time \n233 \nwritings contrasted with those of Bolshevik economists such as V.212 Lenin and the \nCentral Committee observed the campaign among workers in \nPetrograd for what he called 'workers' supervision (control)'.213 \nWorkplace democracy had hitherto not been the party's demand \nand had seemed more like anarchism or, at best, syndicalism to \nseveral leading theorists of Bolshevism; but the popularity of the \nbasic idea was discerned and incorporated into the Bolshevik party's \nlist of slogans.214 Lenin's intention was for \nwage-earners to supervise owners and managers. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. A multi-organisational control, \nenthusiastically but vaguely articulated, was Lenin's keynote. 217 \nMany leftist Bolsheviks wanted to go further than Lenin.219 \nLenin was more cautious. 223 No doubt he sensed that it would hardly rouse his fellow \nBolsheviks to a socialist seizure of power. Lenin seldom forgot his \nduties as chief of a political party. 224 \n The Fire Next Time \n235 \nOther proposals put forward by Lenin included progressive \ntaxation on incomes and property; compulsory publication of \nshareholdings of over 5000 roubles; universal labour duty, which \nwould mean that those who did not work would not eat either. Lenin may have been cautious by Bukharin's \nstandards, if not by Milyutin's, and even stood towards the right of \nBolshevik economic thought in 1917; but he still occupied a spot on \nthe extreme left of the spectrum of Russian economic proposals \noutside his party.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation. Two hundred and forty-two 'peasant instructions' had \nbeen collated, and Lenin urged that the party accept them as the \nbasis of the Bolshevik party's policy.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers.242 Lenin in any case \nconcentrated on encouraging his party to get his new views through \nto the peasants.244 But this was still not an advocacy of peasant \ndirect action, and left the Bolsheviks an open arena for agitation.245 \nLenin enjoyed the discomfiture of his opponents, and was not at all \ndisconcerted by the accusation that he had stolen another party's \npolicy. As \nthese policies acquired growing popular support in summer 1917, \nLenin, from his Finnish refuge, dreamed of applying them as \ngovernmental leader.", "National_Question_1917": " Lenin in January 1910.

Before and during the war, he had offended \nmany colleagues by tapping out the theme that national self-\ndetermination should be the party's slogan and that the right of \nsecession should be advocated; and he had carried the Seventh \nConference with him in April 1917. The Mensheviks \nhad debated the national question at their All-Russian Conference in \nMay 1917. Subsequently, however, the national question faded \nfrom prominence among the anti-Bolshevik socialists;186 and the \nMenshevik Congress in August did not have it on their agenda. \nSemkovski, the Menshevik Organisational Committee member who \nhad disputed the national question with Lenin before 1914, was the \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \nonly Petrograd-based Menshevik to write extensively on it in 1917. But \naccount should also be taken that, in terms of ideas, Lenin's \nproposed solution of the national question within a unitary state \nhad much in common with Semkovski's. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. \nPerhaps he was too busy with other questions; but this can hardly \nhave been the main reason inasmuch as, until April 1917, he had \nmade so much fuss about national self-determination.Or anyone else in the Bolshevik Central Committee- contrary to the \nconventional wisdom in Soviet and Western accounts - played 'the \nnational card' for all it might be worth in 1917. To have devoted the party's main efforts to the national \nquestion would have been a pointless diversion. He got down to elaborating his ideas from \nearly summer 1917. 21\u00b0 For the moment he continued to highlight \nthe expansion undergone by national economies in wartime. In May 1917 he mentioned that, with \nthe anticipated rapid ending of the war, there would be a demilitar-\nisation of industrial production.230 His casualness in 1917 makes a sharp contrast.232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy.235 This reticence about \nnationalisation cannot have been any more coincidental than his \ncoyness about revolutionary war. \nBe that as it may, most party members would have been unaware \nthat nationalisation was party policy unless they happened to have \njoined before May 1917; and when, on 29 August, Lenin finally \naddressed the topic it was in order to confirm that the Bolsheviks no \nlonger advocated land nationalisation.239 \n The Fire Next Time \n237 \nLenin for a while ceased recommending the establishment of \nseparate soviets for agricultural labourers. 9 The View from \nPetrograd: November to \nDecember 1917 \nNEGOTIATIONS ON POWER \nThe 'October Revolution' was not a single act which titanically \nprescribed the entire political process for the rest of the country. The great question of coalition with \ncompeting socialist parties was unanswered. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918. This has become so widespread a phenomenon since \nthe Second World War that it is important to recognise how \nextraordinary it was in 1917. At last, on 18 December 1917, a bemused official \ndelegation from Helsinki to Petrograd obtained on request a \ndocument confirming the secession of Finland from ties of state \nwith Russia. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance. But inaction had \nnever been a Bolshevik virtue; and Lenin skilfully advocated a \npractical plan which at least had the merit, in the eyes of Bolshevik \nleftists, of seeking the retention of a multinational state.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. The suspicion must be strong that he had always known that he \nwould deploy greater violence than he was willing to recognise before \nOctober 1917. \nOn 20 December 1917 the German peace terms were clarified. His domestic \npolitical strategy in 1917, before the seizure of power, had been a \ncombination of the revolution from above with the revolution from \nbelow. Why did Lenin not attempt this in \nthe winter of 1917-18. The number of employed factory workers \nin 1921 had fallen to a third of the number in October 1917; and the \narmy in 1921 was being demobilised, whereas in 1917 the outbreak of \neither a protracted civil war or a war against foreign aggressors was a \nstrong possibility. The \ncontroversy over a separate peace with Germany and Austria-\nHungary in the first three months of 1918 was about to show how \neasy it was for regional, provincial and city party committees to \nignore the central leadership's demands. On 4 \nNovember 1917 he announced to the Petrograd Soviet: 'Our \ndeficiency consists in the fact that our soviet organisation has not \nyet learnt to administer, that we hold too many meetings.", "National_Question_1913": " Only three issues appeared in \n1913. 30 As for the \nCentral Committee, meetings took place more often than in the past: \nseven took place between November 1912 and the end of 1913. His energies in \nthe realm of theory, between the Prague Conference and mid-1914, \nwere spent on the so-called national question. The pioneering work, \nThe National Question and Social-Democracy, had been written by \nOtto Bauer and published in Vienna in 1907. The \ndevelopment of a capitalist economy and culture was bound to \nstrengthen national feelings. The National Question \nand Social-Democracy, while allowing for national independence as a \ngoal for several peoples, emphasised the practical impediments in \nareas such as the Habsburg empire where the national groups were \nterritorially intermingled in bewildering complexity. The counter-scheme \nsketched in Lenin's theses of 1913 rejected extra-territorial proposals \nfor the national question and insisted that nationally-discrete \nterritories at local level were the best assurance that multinational \nstates would not break up into fragments.81 He made a similar \nargument about the Ukraine in the November-December 1913 issue \nof Enlightenment. He drafted a plan for an article in March \n1913. 153 He also continued to write pieces \nintermittently on international developments in 1913-14; and his \njournalism included remarks on militarism, on banking capital, \nimmigration to Europe, and on the corrupting effects of national-\nism. 174 In December 1913, Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. Since July 1913 he and the Central Committee had been \ntalking about holding a Party Congress.", "National_Question_1919": " On 25 March 1919 Zinoviev had complained to the Central \nCommittee that Trotski was ignoring the compromises on 'the military \nquestion' agreed by the Eighth Party Congress; and Lenin was asked to \nwrite to Trotski for redress. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Nikolai \nKrestinski on II January 1919 had been asked by the Central \nCommittee to clarify relations between the central party apparatus \non the one hand and the newly-formed republican governments, \nrepublican party bodies and even the People's Commissariat of \nNationality Affairs on the other. The Politburo resolved on 13 December 1919 that \nonly with their sanction would the republic be established.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. This had been crudely proved on 19 January 1919. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. Lloyd George \nquestioned the practicability of the Allied economic blockade from \nSeptember 1919.89 For the rest of the time he dwelt on \ngeneralities: nationalisation, forcible procurement, centralisation and \ndiscipline. The official \nindustrial value in 1919 was merely forty four per cent of what it had \nbeen in the previous year.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.", "National_Question_1922": " On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. On both occasions the national question was \naddressed.212 But there was no other option in 1922.", "National_Question_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. 1 This led him to \nthrow a blanket over the disagreements between them in the winter of \n1922-1923. There is no \ndenying that the multifaceted dispute of 1922-1923 was highly \nsignificant; but it did not affect the fundaments of the regime's \nprinciples.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. \nNor was there much new in his article 'On Co-operation', which was \ndictated and written up between 4 and 6 January 1923. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. In December 1923 he \npublished The New Course articulating these opinions.", "National_Question_1918": " The period had ended by the second half of 1918. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst.21 But the usefulness of inner subcommittees was not \ndenied, and a further experiment was undertaken in early October 1918 \nwhen a 'Bureau of the Central Committee' began to meet. On 5 February 1919 the Central Committee debated the report \nby Stalin and Dzierzynski on the Perm military collapse.'27 Subsequently, in September 1918, he was confirmed as \nchairman of the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Southern front. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'.42 In 1918 Trotski was by far the greater potential rival.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear. A show of solidarity was needed in wartime.85 But his activity as People's Commissar \nfor Military Affairs since spring 1918 had given the greatest offence. He even claimed that, until spring 1918, the regime's measures \nin many ways carried through a bourgeois revolution. 158 A fudge also occurred on the \nmilitary question. 192 Lenin managed to effect a blend \nof clear intention and reassuring rhetoric which he had failed to obtain \non the national question. Policy on the national \nquestion was portentously grand and extremely vague.", "Political_Situation_1917": " 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Central Committee.

'52 \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut he agreed that a greater specificity about Bolshevik economic \nprojects was essential. Only four of the \ntwenty names were made public; concern about security remained \nand the party reverted to pre-1917 conspiratorial precautions. This situation \nchanged later in August 1917.64 Kerenski's policies, even \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthough Lenin exaggerated, undoubtedly moved rightwards.83 \nLenin, however, now demanded a Bolshevik-led insurrection and \nno longer contemplated an interim period of government by the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries.87 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's tactical acumen waxed and waned in 1917; it was eclipsed \nfor a time in late September. The \nnovelty was to have been constituted by chapter seven, dealing with \nthe Russian revolutionary process in 1917. 105 \nThe result of the establishment of the dictatorship of the \nproletariat would be the beginning of the movement towards the \nend of the need for a state at all. But his other writings in \n1917, especially as regards the future governance of Russia, revealed \nan abiding fascination with terror as a technique of rule. 143 \nPOLITICAL PROJECTS \nThe State and Revolution was an attempt at grand theory. In their \nopinion, the repression and civil war after 1917 constituted a clean \nbreak by Lenin with the tenets of his book; and it is often stressed \nthat Lenin the libertarian in any case was a temporary aberration \nfrom a pattern of thinking that was characteristically authoritarian. Already, in mid-March 1917, \nLenin had been urging that 'power in the state should belong not to \nthe gentry and the capitalists but to the workers and the poorest \npeasants' . 156 Consequently, the proposition that \nLenin throughout 1917 starkly and regularly advocated 'a dictator-\nship of the proletariat' to his party and its supporters is incorrect. 16\u00b0 Fair \nenough: what other options of communication were open to a Lenin \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \nin hiding. 168 This was Lenin the authoritarian in \nwhimsical mood. The troubles between the \ncabinet and the Finnish Sejm, which had broken out soon after the \nFebruary Revolution, continued to give cause for concern through \nthe summer, and the Ukrainian problem grew more acute even after \nthe resignation of the Kadet ministers in early July and the \nassumption of the premiership by Aleksandr Kerenski. 193 \nIn addition, Lenin in 1917 could no longer claim to show much \ngreater concern than the Mensheviks lest the non-Russians should be \nheld in a multinational state against their will and be refused the \nright of secession. For Lenin it mattered more. \nPerhaps he was too busy with other questions; but this can hardly \nhave been the main reason inasmuch as, until April 1917, he had \nmade so much fuss about national self-determination. Nationalist hostility was at its strongest in Finland and \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Ukraine. And, even where the Provisional Government \nfaced troubles in non-Russian areas, the underlying problems were \ncharacteristically economic and social in nature. He got down to elaborating his ideas from \nearly summer 1917. The basic role would be performed by the factory-\n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nworkshop committees elected by the workforce. In May 1917 he wrote about the \ndesirability of governmental control 'over the trusts, over the \nbanks, over trade, over the \"parasites\" .232 \nYet political considerations were already driving him away from \nenunciating land nationalisation as Bolshevik policy.", "Oil_And_Metal_1917": " Supplies \nof raw material to factories shrank fast: coal output fell by 27 per \ncent between January and August 1917; and factories received less \nthan two-fifths of their needs in pig-iron as early as April.", "London_And_Paris_1917": " \nKerenski, according to Lenin, was a puppet of London and Paris and \n To All the Peoples \n247 \nwas merely acceding to direct external pressure in instigating the June \noffensive on the Eastern front.", "Democratic_Peace_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance.

And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation.

'An \nimmediate democratic peace to all peoples' would be proposed. The most important \naspect was the aim of 'a democratic or just peace'. Throughout the previous months he had spoken unremitt-\ningly about the achievement of a democratic peace in Europe \nthrough European socialist revolution.

The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. \nLiberals and conservatives were barely different shades of the same \nphenomenon; and such socialists as entered governmental coalitions \nwith them or even just failed to oppose them were crypto-imperial-\nists, or 'social-chauvinists' in Lenin's phrase. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. Not only far-left socialists but \neven many conservative and liberal politicians, in the rest of Europe \nas well as in Russia, considered the disturbances to be signalling the \npossible outbreak of 'Red revolution': Bavaria and Hungary did, in \nfact, acquire revolutionary socialist administrations in 1919. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment. He was right to declare that the controls over \ncapitalism introduced by Menshevik ministers in summer 1917 were \nineffectual, and that the concessions on the land question extracted \nfrom the Cabinet by the Socialist Revolutionaries did not radically \nalter the rural economic order.66 Every revolutionary party needed money.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917.90 They did not claim that a socialist government \nshould not soon be formed; the Menshevik left wingers, after all, \nalready advocated such a move. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. This scheme for a socialist coalition \nCabinet could be implemented with minimal force; and the Bol-\nsheviks would either belong to such a coalition or, by virtue of being \na large minority fraction in the Assembly, be able to influence the \nnew Cabinet's policies. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. Kerenski's last political prop had been kicked away; \nan all-socialist coalition Cabinet was demanded. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. Martov stood up again to plead \nfor a general coalition of socialists in government. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. 9 The View from \nPetrograd: November to \nDecember 1917 \nNEGOTIATIONS ON POWER \nThe 'October Revolution' was not a single act which titanically \nprescribed the entire political process for the rest of the country. The great question of coalition with \ncompeting socialist parties was unanswered. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. The title of Lenin's letter to the Central \nCommittee, 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power', gave an enormous \nhint about his aims; and his endless criticism and ridiculing of the \nMensheviks as being a 'petit-bourgeois party' in pursuit of 'social-\nchauvinism' was scarcely an attitude conducive to co-operation with \nthem. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. \nLenin found it hard enough to keep his own Bolsheviks united in the \nwinter of 1917-18, and the dispute over the signature of a separate \npeace in March 1918 was to come near to breaking up his party. In a \ngovernmental coalition with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionar-\nies the roles would have been different: he would have been the \ndisunifier and the source of disruption. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. 5 \nThe exodus of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from \nthe Congress had eased Lenin's position by permitting the claim that \nthey had implicitly repudiated the objective of a general socialist \ncoalition. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. Negotiations among all socialist parties were \ninevitable. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. This encouraged the Menshevik \nInternationalists and leftists in the Jewish Bund to canvass more \nstrongly in their parties for the inception of talks designed to produce \na compromise with the Bolsheviks and an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment.6 The Bolshevik Central Committee convened on 29 \nOctober. But it is also possible that neither Lenin nor \nTrotski yet wanted to be seen as obvious road blocks in the way of \ninter-socialist harmony; or that they had already determined on \ncoalition talks as a delaying tactic until such time as the Bolsheviks \nwere in a stronger position. 13 Trotski resumed the \npolitical offensive in the Bolshevik Central Committee on I \nNovember, opposing the exclusion of Lenin from any coalition. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. Lenin drew up an ultimatum: either they obtained the \nparty's approval to form a coalition government, and Lenin would \nfeel free to campaign against such a government; or else Lenin would \nobtain the party's sanction and the opposition itself would campaign \nagainst Sovnarkom. And there were others \nlike Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, People's Commissar for Labour, who \nagreed not to leave their posts but made public their disgust with the \nrole of Lenin and Trotski in the collapse of coalition talks. The Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries themselves were beginning to recognise that \nthe Soviet government might not prove to be so ephemeral as once \nseemed likely. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies continued to attend the sessions of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, badgering the \nCouncil of People's Commissars with criticisms of its officials' \nconduct. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. \nFor some days after the termination of coalition talks involving the \nMensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, Spiridonova conti-\nnued to hold back. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries retained an all-\nsocialist coalition as their ideal objective. They formed their own separate party in \nNovember 1917 and openly opposed Chernov at the Second All-\nRussian Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. With this mandate from peasant Russia in their \npockets, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries felt able to re-enter \nnegotiations with the Bolsheviks. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. They were consumed by \nthe problems of setting up Sovnarkom; of brow-beating his party's \nCentral Committee; of cajoling the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ninto office; of overseeing the disposition of military and political \nforces in Petrograd to ensure the final removal of Kerenski and his \ndiminishing band of supporters; of writing and elaborating the \nlegislation which poured forth from the government's chaotic offices \nin the Smolny Institute. '35 Local Bolsheviks \nwere simply implored to make their own political arrangements and \nkeep an eye on the central party newspaper for general guidance. Some \nsoviets had for months been in the hands of socialists seeking the \nProvisional Government's overthrow. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. It \nis true that the Socialist Revolutionaries retained much sympathy \namong soldiers on the southern sector.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. 56 \nLenin and Stalin remained allies on the national question; and, \nsince principal opponents such as Bukharin and Pyatakov were \noutside Petrograd (in Moscow and Kiev), and others such as \nDzierzynski were busy in the Military-Revolutionary Committee, \nthey pushed forward with the official policy as formulated by the \nApril Party Conference. 58 \nThe policy was fraught with an unanticipated difficulty: the \nFinnish social-democrats, whose left wing under Karl Wiik had \nbeen expected by Lenin to install a socialist government, failed to \ncome to power. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks.80 Viktor Nogin, on \nresigning his post as People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, \npredicted that the Soviet government would steadily move towards \ntt::rrorist techniques if the Bolsheviks refused to form a broad socialist \ncoalition.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety. \nIts members included not only liberals but also several Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries; all of them sought the forcible \noverthrow of Bolshevism. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to a man and \nwoman, were implacably opposed to a separate peace. Lenin continued to call for working-class initiative, to \nwelcome factory workers in person to the Smolny Institute and to \nproclaim the ultimate objectives of communism. The central party leadership was a collective of \nMarxist believers. The Bolsheviks, as far-left socialists, were \nhighly unlikely to regard a relaxation of controls on capitalism as \nan immediately desirable priority. The entire project of socialist \nrevolution would otherwise seem to them to have a weak \nrationale. Osinski and other \nBolshevik leftists were elaborating an agrarian policy involving the \nrapid collectivisation of peasant households. 123 Poor Lenin. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. 127 \nThe hypothesis that Lenin had sufficient authority to introduce the \nideas of 1921 in 1917 badly misconstrues the ideological nature of \nBolshevism after the October Revolution; it also neglects the party's \norganisational disjointedness and localism. The notion that \nan authentic social transformation from capitalism into socialism \ninvolved the promotion and participations of 'the masses' was widely \nheld. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice. Lenin before October had \nadvocated ideas resting on an alliance between workers and peasants.", "Bolshevik_Party_Organisations_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. If these \ndifficulties are large in the late twentieth century, when the \n239 \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \ninstruments of the mass media are profusely available to political \nleaders, they were still larger in earlier decades. \nLenin's opponents, at the time and afterwards, focused upon his \ndelight in manipulative politics. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. In the committees of the \nparty there was greater awareness, and Lenin needed to express \nhimself more sophisticatedly among activists and leaders in Petro-\ngrad. Ambiguity and \ninchoateness proliferated, but this partly derived from the reluctance \nof Lenin and other Bolsheviks to analyse developments in other \ncountries in much detail. Strictly speaking, Lenin had no 'foreign \n To All the Peoples \n241 \npolicy'. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own. In addition, the Bolshevik outlook was orientated upon \nclasses rather than upon political elites.5 Lenin had asserted that \nclass-based struggle across Europe was desirable. \nLiberals and conservatives were barely different shades of the same \nphenomenon; and such socialists as entered governmental coalitions \nwith them or even just failed to oppose them were crypto-imperial-\nists, or 'social-chauvinists' in Lenin's phrase.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution.8 \nLenin was preoccupied by the search for signs of discontent in \nfactories and barracks in Germany. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 10 The \nBolshevik central newspaper kept a steady eye on such events as they \nbecame public news. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. Not only far-left socialists but \neven many conservative and liberal politicians, in the rest of Europe \nas well as in Russia, considered the disturbances to be signalling the \npossible outbreak of 'Red revolution': Bavaria and Hungary did, in \nfact, acquire revolutionary socialist administrations in 1919. \n To All the Peoples \n243 \nWriters in the non-Bolshevik Russian press perceived these events \nas having a cardinal significance. 17 And yet not once did Lenin \nmention Michaelis by name. Calls \nby him and other Bolshevik Central Committee members for \n'fraternisation' between Russian and German soldiers corroborated \nthis dual conclusion among his enemies. His usual gambit was to brush the matter aside by contending \nthat the Bolsheviks, simply by proposing a 'democratic peace' and \npublishing the secret treaties, would stimulate popular insurrections \nin Europe. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 24 References by him and by Stalin to the importance of non-\nEuropean nationalism marked them off from several other leading \nBolshevik strategists. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Lenin's statements \nimplied that the Bolsheviks would fight only if circumstances forced \ntheir hand; and he eschewed any indication about the timing of such \na war. 33 In the second place, the circumstances of Lenin's remarks \ndeserve scrutiny. His Pravda articles and his speeches to the First \nSoviet Congress were framed as a response to the allegations that the \nBolsheviks would sign a separate treaty with Germany. \nConsequently, most Bolsheviks did not know that 'revolutionary \nwar' had ever been among Lenin's proposals. Possibly Lenin recognised that his party's popularity lay in \nits promise to end the war, and that even a conditional prospect of \ncontinuing with the fighting would be unattractive. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Before 1917, Bukharin and Trotski objected to Lenin's \ndismissiveness towards the European peace movement.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred.43 \nThus not only Lenin but also his Central Committee associates \nlargely avoided a topic that would have damaged the party's \npopularity. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. There can be no definitive answer; but it is not \ninconceivable that, when writing privately in favour of revolutionary \nwar, he was not revealing his genuine intentions but felt that the time \nhad not yet arrived to convince his colleagues, especially those on the \nleft wing of the Bolshevik party, of the impracticability of prolonging \nmilitary engagement. \nIndeed, it may be wrong to assume that Lenin really had a firm \nand considered attitude to 'revolutionary war' in these months. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917.48 He may also have sensed that his \npolemics against the Provisional Government would be more biting if \nthe specifically Russian dimensions of governmental problems were \npin-pointed by the Bolsheviks. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment. He was right to declare that the controls over \ncapitalism introduced by Menshevik ministers in summer 1917 were \nineffectual, and that the concessions on the land question extracted \nfrom the Cabinet by the Socialist Revolutionaries did not radically \nalter the rural economic order.50 \nNone the less Lenin's thinking had its incoherences as well as its \nexaggerations. And he could perceive that it would do the Bolsheviks \nno harm if they put themselves forward as better protectors of the \nnational interest than were the Kadets, the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. 53 At any \nrate Lenin disowned the aim of seeking the dissolution of the Russian \narmed forces. Lenin, the \nunbending internationalist and harrier of all professed patriots, was \nsimultaneously standing forward as the only sure defender of Mother \nRussia. The German military danger, Kerenski's alleged \ntreason and the need to keep the Russian army in operational order \nwere themes helping to repudiate the accusation that Lenin and other \nBolshevik leaders were German agents. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. The main accusers in the press, \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nVladimir Burtsev and Grigori Aleksinski, stated that Lenin had met \nup with Parvus on his trip back from Switzerland. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Aleksinski published a recorded list of \ntelegrams which had passed between Lenin (or other members of \nthe Ulyanov family in Petrograd) and Bolshevik representatives such \nas Hanecki, Radek and M. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry. 57 \nCertainly, German diplomacy had an interest in looking favour-\nably upon the party of Lenin. Bolshevik propaganda about peace \nassisted in increasing Russian weariness with the war; and politicians \nin Berlin knew that if the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, at the \nvery least a truce could be arranged on the Eastern front. Their contention, expressed in a series of \nformal statements from April to July, was that personal defamation \nwas being used as a means of achieving the annihilation of the \nBolshevik party. And yet it does not amount to a refutation of the charge \nthat the Bolshevik Central Committee frequently and knowingly \nreceived donations from the German government.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them. \nNo moral considerations inhibited the Bolshevik Central Commit-\ntee from receiving a subsidy from anyone at all. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy.f both the Russian and German governments; and that the German \nauthorities' recklessness in assisting the Bolsheviks financially would \nnot alter his commitment to the strategy. Kerenski would treat the receipt of such monies \nby the Bolsheviks as high treason, and most Russian citizens would \nhave sympathised with Kerenski's assessment. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection. \nSuch Bolsheviks were almost certainly unaware that much dirt might \nhave come out in the wash of a public trial. 70 \nYet account needs to be taken that German financial subventions \nwere not unique to the Bolsheviks.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). Attempts \nwere apparently made to do the same with non-Russian nationalists \nin the Russian empire. \nAnd yet Aleksinski and his friends, as well as their successors since \nthe Second World War, did not merely state that the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee received 'German gold'; they asserted that the \nfunds from Berlin were indispensable for the Bolshevik political \nadvance in 1917.74 \n To All the Peoples \n251 \nAleksinski, however, could not supply all the monetary details; and \nwe still do not know how much money arrived in the Bolshevik \nexchequer. Finances were in any case not the greatest difficulty for \nRussian parties in the months from March 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee obtained its \npremises in the Kshesinskaya Palace, but paid nothing for it and \nejected the owner, the ex-ballerina and court favourite M. Also, the 200-300,000 people who \njoined the Bolshevik party were expected to contribute to party \nfunds, 78 and Pravda, after its first issue, was not given away but sold. \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions. 79 In the following discussions with \nCentral Committee emissaries, Lenin insisted on returning to put his \ncase.80 Lenin \narrived bewigged and beardless. 82 Then Lenin spoke for an hour.83 The gist of Lenin's words, however, has survived. Again, he \ncontrasted mid-October with early July, arguing that 'the majority' \nwas behind the Bolsheviks.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. Uritski, while being on the left of the Bolshevik \n To All the Peoples \n253 \nspectrum, asserted that the military force available for an insurrec-\ntion was insubstantial; but he took this as a reason for conducting \nstrenuous propaganda among the Petro grad garrison soldiers. After the Central Committee meeting they were to \ncompose a letter to various leading Bolshevik bodies; and its contents \npresumably give an indication of the arguments used by them at the \nmeeting itself. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two.93 None the less, Lenin had \nnot got quite everything his way: the suggestion that the transfer of \npower should take place at the northern regional soviet gathering was \nr~jected. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide. His \ncolleagues also felt that, even if an uprising in Minsk were to succeed \n(which was unlikely), a damaging impression would be given that \npower was passing not to the soviets in general but to a splinter \ngroup of soviets dominated by Bolsheviks.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. It also \nremained to be discovered how the rest of the Bolshevik party would \ntake to the Central Committee's line. Kamenev and Zinoviev \ndispatched their critical letter to the Petersburg and Moscow City \nCommittees as well as to other influential party bodies and fractions \ninside the soviets;96 they knew that other right-wing members of the \nCentral Committee - notably Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov - had not \nattended on 10 October: the hope was nurtured that a further debate \nmight pull Lenin back from the brink. The \nparty's local leaderships in cities as distant as Saratov were \ninformed. Nor do all the major city \ncommittees of the Bolshevik party seem to have been initiated into \nthe decision of 10 October. This possibly suited Lenin, since he knew \nhe had a strong chance of support from the Petrograd and Moscow \nleaderships. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established.98 \nLenin's two critics in the Central Committee, however, were \nreadying themselves for a last attempt to change the decision on \nthe seizure of power. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. Lenin, the key speaker, arrived late. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. Every other \nspeaker, including the Bolshevik rightist V. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. It also displayed a \nfeeling throughout Russian politics that Kerenski's government had \nlost its way; that Kerenski would not go quietly and would try to \ndisarm the soviets; that the Bolsheviks should not flinch in the \ncoming trial of strength. And so discussion shifted towards the \nquestion whether the Bolsheviks should initiate the clash. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Lenin \ncastigated both of them for ignoring 'objective conditions'. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. 112 \nIt was beginning to look as if the meeting regarded defence as the \nbest form of attack; and Zinoviev and Kamenev, sensing that their \nposition was not in fact irretrievable, restated their objection to \nLenin. His solution was to suggest that the \nforthcoming All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies be kept in permanent session until the Consti-\ntuent Assembly so as to pressurise the Assembly to carry out the \nappropriate decisions. Lenin had for \nmonths declared that only the Bolsheviks would dare to convoke the \nAssembly. Lenin's motion reaffirmed the 10 October decision and \n To All the Peoples \n257 \nexpressed 'complete confidence that the Central Committee and the \nSoviet would at the right time indicate the propitious moment and the \nappropriate methods of the offensive'. The Central Committee \nappointed a Military-Revolutionary Centre consisting of Sverdlov, \nStalin, Bubnov, M. Uritski and Dzierzynski; all were instructed to \n'enter the membership of the revolutionary Soviet committee' . \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. The Soviet sanctioned its \nformation on 16 October, empowering it to co-ordinate the garrisons \nfor the capital's defence; 121 and the importance of the matter may \nexplain why Trotski, who had been chosen as Soviet chairman, was \nabsent from the Central Committee. In fact, the Military-Revolu-\ntionary Centre did not participate in the Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee. When this Committee was selected on 20 \nOctober, its five-man Bureau included three Bolsheviks: Antonov-\nOvseenko, Podvoiski and Sadovski. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. \nLenin approved the Central Committee's choi \u00b7e of the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee as the organ of insurredion and wished to \nkeep its activities under review. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. Sverdlov main-\ntained contact with Podvoiski, whom he sent to Lenin - probably on \nsome date between 20 and 23 October. 122 Lenin conducted a \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngruelling interview since Podvoiski wanted the Bolshevik Military \nOrganisation to head the uprising. Lenin supported the Central \nCommittee in insisting that a non-party organ, the Petrograd \nSoviet's Military-Revolutionary Committee, should have charge. For the purposes of political presenta-\ntion it was vital that 'the Soviet' and not 'the party' was seen to be \nseizing power. 124 \nLenin was merely accentuating their point (and at last displaying the \ntactical subtlety which was to win him such renown); but his \nintervention put a useful check on Podvoiski. 125 He wanted no \nrepetition of the trouble caused by the Bureau of the Bolshevik \nMilitary Organisation in the July Days. Podvoiski got his own back \nby enquiring about Lenin's progress with 'the decrees on the land, on \npeace, on workers' control over production and on the organisation \nof the Soviet republic'. Kamenev and Zinoviev had dispatched an anti-Lenin letter to \nBolshevik party organisations; and, on 18 October, Kamenev \npublished a declaration against a seizure of power in the far-left \nsocialist but non-Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn (or 'New \nLife'). J3J Trotski had taken to suggesting that, if the \nBolsheviks took tg the streets, it would happen only in reaction to an \nattack by the Provisional Government; 132 and Zinoviev was attracted \nto such a proposition even though he knew that Trotski was using it \nmerely as a subterfuge. Stalin, Workers' Path editor, probably calculated also that \nZinoviev and Kamenev would help in restraining Lenin from too \nreckless a strategy in the days ahead. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Lenin's incaution had \nacquired deserved notoriety in August and September; his harangues \nin favour of action at any price could have cost the party dearly in \nOctober. The Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee continued preparations for an uprising \nwhenever the moment seemed ripe. The Bolshevik press in \nPetrograd warned constantly of the dangers posed by a resuscitation \nof Kornilovite conspiracies. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. There remained several Bolsheviks, not only in the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee but also in the\u00b7 party's City Committee, \nwho demanded an immediate seizure of power: Lenin was not the \nonly Leninist. The Central Committee leaned in favour of Trotski's \nsolution; and Stalin wrote in Workers' Path on 24 October about the \nneed for the Congress of Soviets to appoint a new government. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 134 \nLenin lived on in M. 136 Fofanova, who \nworked in the Bolshevik Central Committee Secretariat, implored \nhim not to venture out of doors. On 24 October, Kerenski tried to \nsuppress Bolshevik newspapers in the capital; police raids were \nfrequent. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. To the Central \nCommittee's delight, Kerenski's repressive demarche was widely \ntaken to authenticate the Bolshevik claim that they were simply \ndefending themselves when making their military dispositions. \nAnd yet the proffered help of one central figure, Lenin, was \nshrugged aside. Lenin sent out Fofanova several times to the Central \nCommittee in the Smolny Institute on 24 October with his pleas to be \nallowed out of hiding. \nHe covered part of his face with a bandage, positioned his trusty wig \non his head, grabbed his cap and went with Eino Rahja towards \nBolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. As the Bolsheviks and \ntheir supporters in the armed forces and the Red Guard spread their \npower through the capital, a surprised and dejected Kerenski made \nhis plans for escape from the cordon around the Winter Palace. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. Lenin \nsought to change this. It was Lenin's will to ensure that, when the delegatt:s \nassembled, power would already have been grasped from the \nProvisional Government; and, as soon as he reached the Institute, \nhe imparted this idea to his colleagues with characteristic insistence. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. Not only Trotski but also Lenin's opponents Kamenev \nand Zinoviev were present. 150 \nLenin, usually a punctiliously efficient person, still had not \nprepared the various 'theses' asked for by the Central Committee \non 21 October. Its contents are \nunknown; 152 but Lenin took over the final elaboration. Trotski, \nto general acclaim, suggested 'people's commissars'; and Lenin added \nthat the government could be called the 'Council of People's \nCommissars'. At 10 am Lenin decided that the \nmoment was appropriate to announce the regime's removal. State power had \npassed into the hands of tht\" organ of the Petrograd Soviet of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies: the Military-Revolutionary So-\nviet, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \ngarrison'. Lenin \npresumably wanted to have it recorded that the insurrection had been \nundertaken before the Congress met. This interim, on the other hand, \nprevented any possible vacillation by the non-Bolshevik \u00b7delegates to \nthe Congress about Kerenski's overthrow; they would meet with a \nfait accompli. The Bolsheviks, while knowing that they would \nconstitute by far the largest party at the Congress with around 300 \nout of 670 delegates, knew they would lack a clear majority. A Petrograd \nSoviet session opened at 2. \nHis statement that Lenin was to address the Petrograd Soviet drew \n\\mremitting applause'. Trotski gave him a suitable introduction: \n'Long live comrade Lenin, who has now returned to us. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. An \nunnamed member of the audience interjected that the Bolshevik \nparty had improperly arrogated the rights of the Congress of Soviets. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. \nMartov, himself no great tactician, could scarcely believe that Dan \nand Chernov, who twenty four hours previously had endorsed \npolicies designed to bring about an immediate peace and an \nimmediate confiscation of gentry-owned land, would walk out of a \nCongress which was about to announce exactly such policies, and \nthat they would toss aside the opportunity to bargain with the \nBolsheviks about the composition of an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Lunacharski, a member of the Novaya Zhizn group, who \nhad rejoined the Bolsheviks with the Interdistricters, declared that he \nhad 'absolutely no objection' to Martov's suggestion. The main-\nstream leaderships of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies, however, held to their plan; they castigated the Bolshevik-led \nviolence, demanded further negotiations with Kerenski and walked \nout. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. Such claims misread Lenin's intentions; for the \nstateless communities of anarchism were no part of the Bolshevik \nleader's intentions for the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the \npoorest peasants'. The \nBolshevik fraction of the Congress of Soviets met to co-ordinate \ntactics. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. Lenin was busy in all of them: he \nhad returned to the centre of action. 172 The Second \nCongress of Soviets reconvened at 9 pm on 26 October. 173 \nFIRST WEEK, FIRST DECREES \nThe various pronouncements made by the Bolshevik leadership in the \nweek after the October seizure in Petrograd were of momentous \nsignificance in modern Russian history; and they also deserve \n To All the Peoples \n267 \nscrutiny inasmuch as their wording reveals much about the worries \nwhich the Bolshevik party leadership had about the political \nsituation. Lenin had previously been arguing that the party's \nsupporters would appreciate action better than words. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. These were early days, and the Bolsheviks and their \nsupporters watched warily how the countryside would react to them. The forcible \n 268 \nLenin: A Political L(fe \nincorporation of 'small nationalities' was explicitly rejected. Yet \nLenin was not quite as incautious and lacking in guile as might \nappear. The \nreasons were not explained by Lenin. Furthermore, Lenin \n~sserted that the land of 'rank-and-file peasants' was not subject to \nconfiscation. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. Its name would be the Council of \nPeople's Commissars and 'Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)' was announced \nas its 'chairman' . The principal \nmeasure signalling the other side of Bolshevik intentions was the \nDecree on the Press which was published on 27 October. The Decree \non the Press made plain that the Soviet authorities under the \nBolsheviks would brook no fundamental opposition (and the \ncontemporaneous searches of houses and printing enterprises by \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee enforced the decree immedia-\ntely). Bolshevik spokesmen argued, as had Lenin in The State and \nRevolution that the propertied classes had always had an unfair \nadvantage in setting up newspapers, and that the use of the press \nshould not be confined mainly to the rich. Yet the basic intention to \nclose down anti-Bolshevik newspapers was only lightly veiled. Laws to nationalise banks and \nindustrial syndicates, which Lenin had talked of before the October \nseizure of power, had yet to be formulated. Eventually, on 5 \nNovember, twelve days after the Petrograd uprising, Lenin released a \nstatement calling on workers to 'introduce the strictest control over \nproduction and accounts' and to arrest anyone found committing \nsabotage. Instead, the new authorities laid their stress on the rupture \nwith the politics of Russia and Europe constituted by the October \nseizure of power. Workers, along \nwith soldiers and peasants, were being encouraged to 'take all power \nin the localities into the hands of their soviets'.", "Bolshevik_Party_Life_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. If these \ndifficulties are large in the late twentieth century, when the \n239 \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \ninstruments of the mass media are profusely available to political \nleaders, they were still larger in earlier decades. \nLenin's opponents, at the time and afterwards, focused upon his \ndelight in manipulative politics. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. In the committees of the \nparty there was greater awareness, and Lenin needed to express \nhimself more sophisticatedly among activists and leaders in Petro-\ngrad. Whether in a treatise like \nThe State and Revolution, or in a mass-circulation newspaper article, \nor at an open-air workers' gathering, or in a Central Committee \nclosed session, or even merely in a jotted note which remained \nunpublished until after his death (and such notes elucidate vital \naspects of his career): all his pronouncements must be analysed in the \nlight of the prevailing circumstances and of the specific objectives \npursued by Lenin at the time. Ambiguity and \ninchoateness proliferated, but this partly derived from the reluctance \nof Lenin and other Bolsheviks to analyse developments in other \ncountries in much detail. Strictly speaking, Lenin had no 'foreign \n To All the Peoples \n241 \npolicy'. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own. In addition, the Bolshevik outlook was orientated upon \nclasses rather than upon political elites.5 Lenin had asserted that \nclass-based struggle across Europe was desirable.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution.8 \nLenin was preoccupied by the search for signs of discontent in \nfactories and barracks in Germany. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 10 The \nBolshevik central newspaper kept a steady eye on such events as they \nbecame public news. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. \nNeither he nor his Bolshevik colleagues provided serious commen-\ntary upon the German submarine attacks on American shipping, or \nthe ensuing entry of the USA into the war on the side of the Allies. \nLenin barely bothered to follow the changing fortunes of the armies \nlocked in battle on the Eastern and Western fronts. \n To All the Peoples \n243 \nWriters in the non-Bolshevik Russian press perceived these events \nas having a cardinal significance. 17 And yet not once did Lenin \nmention Michaelis by name. 19 \nMenshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary and Kadet commentators inter-\npreted Lenin's attitude in two ways: either Lenin lacked all trace of \nmilitary and political realism, or else his zeal to pull Russia out of the \nWar was so overpowering that he would sign a separate treaty with \nthe Germans. Calls \nby him and other Bolshevik Central Committee members for \n'fraternisation' between Russian and German soldiers corroborated \nthis dual conclusion among his enemies. 21 \nAnd so Lenin was obliged to enunciate what he would do if, \nshould he come to power, a European socialist revolution failed to \nensue. His usual gambit was to brush the matter aside by contending \nthat the Bolsheviks, simply by proposing a 'democratic peace' and \npublishing the secret treaties, would stimulate popular insurrections \nin Europe. Lenin proclaimed that the chances of success were '99 to \nI 00'. 22 His confidence was enhanced by the precedent of the Russian \nnear-revolution of 1905-6, when rebels in Asia and Europe had been \ninspired to demand democratic reforms. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 24 References by him and by Stalin to the importance of non-\nEuropean nationalism marked them off from several other leading \nBolshevik strategists. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war. were \nto place us in the situation of a revolutionary war', the Bolsheviks \nwould not refuse the challenge;29 and in his second speech five days \nlater he announced that 'in certain circumstances we cannot get by \nwithout revolutionary war'. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Lenin's statements \nimplied that the Bolsheviks would fight only if circumstances forced \ntheir hand; and he eschewed any indication about the timing of such \na war. 33 In the second place, the circumstances of Lenin's remarks \ndeserve scrutiny. His Pravda articles and his speeches to the First \nSoviet Congress were framed as a response to the allegations that the \nBolsheviks would sign a separate treaty with Germany. \nConsequently, most Bolsheviks did not know that 'revolutionary \nwar' had ever been among Lenin's proposals.36 Lenin's journalism and \n To All the Peoples \n245 \nopen speech-making gave an ever-diminishing impression of a man \nwho contemplated the renewal of the war even as a contingency plan. Possibly Lenin recognised that his party's popularity lay in \nits promise to end the war, and that even a conditional prospect of \ncontinuing with the fighting would be unattractive. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Before 1917, Bukharin and Trotski objected to Lenin's \ndismissiveness towards the European peace movement. 39 The inclina-\ntion to talk about peace and play down the theme of a possible \nrevolutionary war grew stronger after the February Revolution, and \nLenin followed rather than led his colleagues in this.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred.43 \nThus not only Lenin but also his Central Committee associates \nlargely avoided a topic that would have damaged the party's \npopularity. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. There can be no definitive answer; but it is not \ninconceivable that, when writing privately in favour of revolutionary \nwar, he was not revealing his genuine intentions but felt that the time \nhad not yet arrived to convince his colleagues, especially those on the \nleft wing of the Bolshevik party, of the impracticability of prolonging \nmilitary engagement. Lenin did not inflate the balloon \nunnecessarily. \nIndeed, it may be wrong to assume that Lenin really had a firm \nand considered attitude to 'revolutionary war' in these months. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917.46 \nLenin's reasons for changing his emphasis are unclear.48 He may also have sensed that his \npolemics against the Provisional Government would be more biting if \nthe specifically Russian dimensions of governmental problems were \npin-pointed by the Bolsheviks. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment.50 \nNone the less Lenin's thinking had its incoherences as well as its \nexaggerations. 52 But Lenin would beat Kerenski with any stick that \nlay to hand. And he could perceive that it would do the Bolsheviks \nno harm if they put themselves forward as better protectors of the \nnational interest than were the Kadets, the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. 53 At any \nrate Lenin disowned the aim of seeking the dissolution of the Russian \narmed forces. Lenin, the \nunbending internationalist and harrier of all professed patriots, was \nsimultaneously standing forward as the only sure defender of Mother \nRussia. The German military danger, Kerenski's alleged \ntreason and the need to keep the Russian army in operational order \nwere themes helping to repudiate the accusation that Lenin and other \nBolshevik leaders were German agents. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. The main accusers in the press, \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nVladimir Burtsev and Grigori Aleksinski, stated that Lenin had met \nup with Parvus on his trip back from Switzerland. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Aleksinski published a recorded list of \ntelegrams which had passed between Lenin (or other members of \nthe Ulyanov family in Petrograd) and Bolshevik representatives such \nas Hanecki, Radek and M. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry. 57 \nCertainly, German diplomacy had an interest in looking favour-\nably upon the party of Lenin. Bolshevik propaganda about peace \nassisted in increasing Russian weariness with the war; and politicians \nin Berlin knew that if the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, at the \nvery least a truce could be arranged on the Eastern front.58 \nLenin and Zinoviev maintained that their various accusers were \nmotivated by political spite. Their contention, expressed in a series of \nformal statements from April to July, was that personal defamation \nwas being used as a means of achieving the annihilation of the \nBolshevik party. And yet it does not amount to a refutation of the charge \nthat the Bolshevik Central Committee frequently and knowingly \nreceived donations from the German government.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them. \nNo moral considerations inhibited the Bolshevik Central Commit-\ntee from receiving a subsidy from anyone at all.66 Every revolutionary party needed money. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy.f both the Russian and German governments; and that the German \nauthorities' recklessness in assisting the Bolsheviks financially would \nnot alter his commitment to the strategy. Kerenski would treat the receipt of such monies \nby the Bolsheviks as high treason, and most Russian citizens would \nhave sympathised with Kerenski's assessment. Trial and even \nexecution of Lenin might easily follow. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection. \nSuch Bolsheviks were almost certainly unaware that much dirt might \nhave come out in the wash of a public trial. 70 \nYet account needs to be taken that German financial subventions \nwere not unique to the Bolsheviks.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). Attempts \nwere apparently made to do the same with non-Russian nationalists \nin the Russian empire. \nAnd yet Aleksinski and his friends, as well as their successors since \nthe Second World War, did not merely state that the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee received 'German gold'; they asserted that the \nfunds from Berlin were indispensable for the Bolshevik political \nadvance in 1917.74 \n To All the Peoples \n251 \nAleksinski, however, could not supply all the monetary details; and \nwe still do not know how much money arrived in the Bolshevik \nexchequer. Finances were in any case not the greatest difficulty for \nRussian parties in the months from March 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee obtained its \npremises in the Kshesinskaya Palace, but paid nothing for it and \nejected the owner, the ex-ballerina and court favourite M. Also, the 200-300,000 people who \njoined the Bolshevik party were expected to contribute to party \nfunds, 78 and Pravda, after its first issue, was not given away but sold. \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions. She was married to the left-wing \n 252 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik Nikolai Sukhanov, whom she craftily persuaded not to \ncome home that night because the weather was so 'wretched'.80 Lenin \narrived bewigged and beardless. 82 Then Lenin spoke for an hour.83 The gist of Lenin's words, however, has survived. Again, he \ncontrasted mid-October with early July, arguing that 'the majority' \nwas behind the Bolsheviks.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'.86 Lenin \ndid not deny that 'the masses' had lately exhibited a certain \n'indifference' to high politics. 87 \nBefore such an audience, which was in closer touch than he with \ncurrent political developments, Lenin sought to argue that insurrec-\ntion was urgently required. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. Uritski, while being on the left of the Bolshevik \n To All the Peoples \n253 \nspectrum, asserted that the military force available for an insurrec-\ntion was insubstantial; but he took this as a reason for conducting \nstrenuous propaganda among the Petro grad garrison soldiers. After the Central Committee meeting they were to \ncompose a letter to various leading Bolshevik bodies; and its contents \npresumably give an indication of the arguments used by them at the \nmeeting itself. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two.93 None the less, Lenin had \nnot got quite everything his way: the suggestion that the transfer of \npower should take place at the northern regional soviet gathering was \nr~jected. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide. His \ncolleagues also felt that, even if an uprising in Minsk were to succeed \n(which was unlikely), a damaging impression would be given that \npower was passing not to the soviets in general but to a splinter \ngroup of soviets dominated by Bolsheviks.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. It also \nremained to be discovered how the rest of the Bolshevik party would \ntake to the Central Committee's line. Kamenev and Zinoviev \ndispatched their critical letter to the Petersburg and Moscow City \nCommittees as well as to other influential party bodies and fractions \ninside the soviets;96 they knew that other right-wing members of the \nCentral Committee - notably Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov - had not \nattended on 10 October: the hope was nurtured that a further debate \nmight pull Lenin back from the brink. Nor do all the major city \ncommittees of the Bolshevik party seem to have been initiated into \nthe decision of 10 October. This possibly suited Lenin, since he knew \nhe had a strong chance of support from the Petrograd and Moscow \nleaderships. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. Lenin, the key speaker, arrived late. 10\u00b0 Casually snatching off his wig and \nplacing it on the table in front of him, Lenin repeated the arguments \nin favour of speedy insurrection. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. Every other \nspeaker, including the Bolshevik rightist V. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. It also displayed a \nfeeling throughout Russian politics that Kerenski's government had \nlost its way; that Kerenski would not go quietly and would try to \ndisarm the soviets; that the Bolsheviks should not flinch in the \ncoming trial of strength. And so discussion shifted towards the \nquestion whether the Bolsheviks should initiate the clash. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Lenin \ncastigated both of them for ignoring 'objective conditions'. Lenin's sharp words did not \nhave an immediate effect. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. 112 \nIt was beginning to look as if the meeting regarded defence as the \nbest form of attack; and Zinoviev and Kamenev, sensing that their \nposition was not in fact irretrievable, restated their objection to \nLenin. His solution was to suggest that the \nforthcoming All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies be kept in permanent session until the Consti-\ntuent Assembly so as to pressurise the Assembly to carry out the \nappropriate decisions. Kamenev charged Lenin with forcing the \npolitical pace. Lenin had for \nmonths declared that only the Bolsheviks would dare to convoke the \nAssembly. Lenin's motion reaffirmed the 10 October decision and \n To All the Peoples \n257 \nexpressed 'complete confidence that the Central Committee and the \nSoviet would at the right time indicate the propitious moment and the \nappropriate methods of the offensive'. Uritski and Dzierzynski; all were instructed to \n'enter the membership of the revolutionary Soviet committee' . \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. When this Committee was selected on 20 \nOctober, its five-man Bureau included three Bolsheviks: Antonov-\nOvseenko, Podvoiski and Sadovski. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. \nLenin approved the Central Committee's choi \u00b7e of the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee as the organ of insurredion and wished to \nkeep its activities under review. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. Sverdlov main-\ntained contact with Podvoiski, whom he sent to Lenin - probably on \nsome date between 20 and 23 October. 122 Lenin conducted a \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngruelling interview since Podvoiski wanted the Bolshevik Military \nOrganisation to head the uprising. Lenin supported the Central \nCommittee in insisting that a non-party organ, the Petrograd \nSoviet's Military-Revolutionary Committee, should have charge. For the purposes of political presenta-\ntion it was vital that 'the Soviet' and not 'the party' was seen to be \nseizing power. 124 \nLenin was merely accentuating their point (and at last displaying the \ntactical subtlety which was to win him such renown); but his \nintervention put a useful check on Podvoiski. 125 He wanted no \nrepetition of the trouble caused by the Bureau of the Bolshevik \nMilitary Organisation in the July Days. Podvoiski got his own back \nby enquiring about Lenin's progress with 'the decrees on the land, on \npeace, on workers' control over production and on the organisation \nof the Soviet republic'. Kamenev and Zinoviev had dispatched an anti-Lenin letter to \nBolshevik party organisations; and, on 18 October, Kamenev \npublished a declaration against a seizure of power in the far-left \nsocialist but non-Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn (or 'New \nLife'). J3J Trotski had taken to suggesting that, if the \nBolsheviks took tg the streets, it would happen only in reaction to an \nattack by the Provisional Government; 132 and Zinoviev was attracted \nto such a proposition even though he knew that Trotski was using it \nmerely as a subterfuge. Stalin, Workers' Path editor, probably calculated also that \nZinoviev and Kamenev would help in restraining Lenin from too \nreckless a strategy in the days ahead. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Lenin's incaution had \nacquired deserved notoriety in August and September; his harangues \nin favour of action at any price could have cost the party dearly in \nOctober. The Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee continued preparations for an uprising \nwhenever the moment seemed ripe. The Bolshevik press in \nPetrograd warned constantly of the dangers posed by a resuscitation \nof Kornilovite conspiracies. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. There remained several Bolsheviks, not only in the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee but also in the\u00b7 party's City Committee, \nwho demanded an immediate seizure of power: Lenin was not the \nonly Leninist. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 134 \nLenin lived on in M. 136 Fofanova, who \nworked in the Bolshevik Central Committee Secretariat, implored \nhim not to venture out of doors. On 24 October, Kerenski tried to \nsuppress Bolshevik newspapers in the capital; police raids were \nfrequent. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. To the Central \nCommittee's delight, Kerenski's repressive demarche was widely \ntaken to authenticate the Bolshevik claim that they were simply \ndefending themselves when making their military dispositions. \nAnd yet the proffered help of one central figure, Lenin, was \nshrugged aside. Lenin sent out Fofanova several times to the Central \nCommittee in the Smolny Institute on 24 October with his pleas to be \nallowed out of hiding. As the Bolsheviks and \ntheir supporters in the armed forces and the Red Guard spread their \npower through the capital, a surprised and dejected Kerenski made \nhis plans for escape from the cordon around the Winter Palace. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. Lenin \nsought to change this. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. Not only Trotski but also Lenin's opponents Kamenev \nand Zinoviev were present. 150 \nLenin, usually a punctiliously efficient person, still had not \nprepared the various 'theses' asked for by the Central Committee \non 21 October. Its contents are \nunknown; 152 but Lenin took over the final elaboration. At 10 am Lenin decided that the \nmoment was appropriate to announce the regime's removal. State power had \npassed into the hands of tht\" organ of the Petrograd Soviet of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies: the Military-Revolutionary So-\nviet, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \ngarrison'. Lenin \npresumably wanted to have it recorded that the insurrection had been \nundertaken before the Congress met. He would have damaged his \nparty's interests if several days had intervened between insurrection \nand Congress; but the interim of a few hours was short enough for \nthe action still to appear as a true transfer of power to the soviets \nrather than to a single party. This interim, on the other hand, \nprevented any possible vacillation by the non-Bolshevik \u00b7delegates to \nthe Congress about Kerenski's overthrow; they would meet with a \nfait accompli. \nLenin's case for urgent measures was not entirely a figment of his \nfevered brain. The Bolsheviks, while knowing that they would \nconstitute by far the largest party at the Congress with around 300 \nout of 670 delegates, knew they would lack a clear majority. Lenin redoubled his demands for a storming of the \npalace, but the besieger. A Petrograd \nSoviet session opened at 2. \nHis statement that Lenin was to address the Petrograd Soviet drew \n\\mremitting applause'. Trotski gave him a suitable introduction: \n'Long live comrade Lenin, who has now returned to us.' 158 Lenin, \nhardly identifiable without his moustache, spoke briefly on the \nprogramme of the as yet unformed Soviet government. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. An \nunnamed member of the audience interjected that the Bolshevik \nparty had improperly arrogated the rights of the Congress of Soviets. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. \nMartov, himself no great tactician, could scarcely believe that Dan \nand Chernov, who twenty four hours previously had endorsed \npolicies designed to bring about an immediate peace and an \nimmediate confiscation of gentry-owned land, would walk out of a \nCongress which was about to announce exactly such policies, and \nthat they would toss aside the opportunity to bargain with the \nBolsheviks about the composition of an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform.165 Martov rose, on the Congress floor, to call for a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict on Petrograd's streets, and for negotiations \nto produce a government consisting of all the parties represented in \nthe soviets. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Lunacharski, a member of the Novaya Zhizn group, who \nhad rejoined the Bolsheviks with the Interdistricters, declared that he \nhad 'absolutely no objection' to Martov's suggestion. The main-\nstream leaderships of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies, however, held to their plan; they castigated the Bolshevik-led \nviolence, demanded further negotiations with Kerenski and walked \nout. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. 169 \nEarlier in the year, there had been vituperative claims that Lenin \nhad returned to Russia to claim the long-vacant throne of the \nanarchist Bakunin. Such claims misread Lenin's intentions; for the \nstateless communities of anarchism were no part of the Bolshevik \nleader's intentions for the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the \npoorest peasants'. Even those who had made the claims, however, \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmust have been surprised by the lack of ceremony attendant upon \nLenin's 'coronation'. Lenin \nremained in Smolny for a while, but had not yet visited the Congress. The \nBolshevik fraction of the Congress of Soviets met to co-ordinate \ntactics. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. Lenin was busy in all of them: he \nhad returned to the centre of action. 172 The Second \nCongress of Soviets reconvened at 9 pm on 26 October. 173 \nFIRST WEEK, FIRST DECREES \nThe various pronouncements made by the Bolshevik leadership in the \nweek after the October seizure in Petrograd were of momentous \nsignificance in modern Russian history; and they also deserve \n To All the Peoples \n267 \nscrutiny inasmuch as their wording reveals much about the worries \nwhich the Bolshevik party leadership had about the political \nsituation. Lenin had previously been arguing that the party's \nsupporters would appreciate action better than words. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. These were early days, and the Bolsheviks and their \nsupporters watched warily how the countryside would react to them. \nThe proclamation described the intentions of 'soviet power'. The forcible \n 268 \nLenin: A Political L(fe \nincorporation of 'small nationalities' was explicitly rejected. Yet \nLenin was not quite as incautious and lacking in guile as might \nappear. The \nreasons were not explained by Lenin. Lenin \nconsequently employed uncharacteristic vocabulary, describing the \ncontinuation of the War as 'the greatest crime against humanity'. 187 \nThis was as near as Lenin could go towards a call for international \nsocialist revolution without aggravating the already great risk that \nhis decree would not be published outside Russia. Furthermore, Lenin \n~sserted that the land of 'rank-and-file peasants' was not subject to \nconfiscation. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. The principal \nmeasure signalling the other side of Bolshevik intentions was the \nDecree on the Press which was published on 27 October. The Decree \non the Press made plain that the Soviet authorities under the \nBolsheviks would brook no fundamental opposition (and the \ncontemporaneous searches of houses and printing enterprises by \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee enforced the decree immedia-\ntely). Bolshevik spokesmen argued, as had Lenin in The State and \nRevolution that the propertied classes had always had an unfair \nadvantage in setting up newspapers, and that the use of the press \nshould not be confined mainly to the rich. Yet the basic intention to \nclose down anti-Bolshevik newspapers was only lightly veiled. Eventually, on 5 \nNovember, twelve days after the Petrograd uprising, Lenin released a \nstatement calling on workers to 'introduce the strictest control over \nproduction and accounts' and to arrest anyone found committing \nsabotage. Workers, along \nwith soldiers and peasants, were being encouraged to 'take all power \nin the localities into the hands of their soviets'.200 No such summons \nhad been issued by a government before; and Lenin and his \nassociates were convinced that the dawn of a new era would soon \nshine upon them.", "Bolshevik_Party_Leadership_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. If these \ndifficulties are large in the late twentieth century, when the \n239 \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \ninstruments of the mass media are profusely available to political \nleaders, they were still larger in earlier decades. \nLenin's opponents, at the time and afterwards, focused upon his \ndelight in manipulative politics. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. In the committees of the \nparty there was greater awareness, and Lenin needed to express \nhimself more sophisticatedly among activists and leaders in Petro-\ngrad. Lenin sometimes had to modify his ideas or push some \nof them into the background in order to maintain his support; he did \nnot rule the Central Committee. Whether in a treatise like \nThe State and Revolution, or in a mass-circulation newspaper article, \nor at an open-air workers' gathering, or in a Central Committee \nclosed session, or even merely in a jotted note which remained \nunpublished until after his death (and such notes elucidate vital \naspects of his career): all his pronouncements must be analysed in the \nlight of the prevailing circumstances and of the specific objectives \npursued by Lenin at the time. Ambiguity and \ninchoateness proliferated, but this partly derived from the reluctance \nof Lenin and other Bolsheviks to analyse developments in other \ncountries in much detail. Strictly speaking, Lenin had no 'foreign \n To All the Peoples \n241 \npolicy'. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own. In addition, the Bolshevik outlook was orientated upon \nclasses rather than upon political elites.5 Lenin had asserted that \nclass-based struggle across Europe was desirable.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution.8 \nLenin was preoccupied by the search for signs of discontent in \nfactories and barracks in Germany. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 10 The \nBolshevik central newspaper kept a steady eye on such events as they \nbecame public news. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. Not only far-left socialists but \neven many conservative and liberal politicians, in the rest of Europe \nas well as in Russia, considered the disturbances to be signalling the \npossible outbreak of 'Red revolution': Bavaria and Hungary did, in \nfact, acquire revolutionary socialist administrations in 1919. Lenin can \nscarcely be faulted for acting on the premise that the public record \nunderstated the continental tumult. \nNeither he nor his Bolshevik colleagues provided serious commen-\ntary upon the German submarine attacks on American shipping, or \nthe ensuing entry of the USA into the war on the side of the Allies. \nLenin barely bothered to follow the changing fortunes of the armies \nlocked in battle on the Eastern and Western fronts. \n To All the Peoples \n243 \nWriters in the non-Bolshevik Russian press perceived these events \nas having a cardinal significance. 17 And yet not once did Lenin \nmention Michaelis by name. 19 \nMenshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary and Kadet commentators inter-\npreted Lenin's attitude in two ways: either Lenin lacked all trace of \nmilitary and political realism, or else his zeal to pull Russia out of the \nWar was so overpowering that he would sign a separate treaty with \nthe Germans. Calls \nby him and other Bolshevik Central Committee members for \n'fraternisation' between Russian and German soldiers corroborated \nthis dual conclusion among his enemies. 21 \nAnd so Lenin was obliged to enunciate what he would do if, \nshould he come to power, a European socialist revolution failed to \nensue. His usual gambit was to brush the matter aside by contending \nthat the Bolsheviks, simply by proposing a 'democratic peace' and \npublishing the secret treaties, would stimulate popular insurrections \nin Europe. 22 His confidence was enhanced by the precedent of the Russian \nnear-revolution of 1905-6, when rebels in Asia and Europe had been \ninspired to demand democratic reforms. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 24 References by him and by Stalin to the importance of non-\nEuropean nationalism marked them off from several other leading \nBolshevik strategists. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war.'28 At the first all-Russian Congress of Soviets of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies, he replied in like manner. were \nto place us in the situation of a revolutionary war', the Bolsheviks \nwould not refuse the challenge;29 and in his second speech five days \nlater he announced that 'in certain circumstances we cannot get by \nwithout revolutionary war'. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Lenin's statements \nimplied that the Bolsheviks would fight only if circumstances forced \ntheir hand; and he eschewed any indication about the timing of such \na war. 33 In the second place, the circumstances of Lenin's remarks \ndeserve scrutiny. His Pravda articles and his speeches to the First \nSoviet Congress were framed as a response to the allegations that the \nBolsheviks would sign a separate treaty with Germany. \nConsequently, most Bolsheviks did not know that 'revolutionary \nwar' had ever been among Lenin's proposals.36 Lenin's journalism and \n To All the Peoples \n245 \nopen speech-making gave an ever-diminishing impression of a man \nwho contemplated the renewal of the war even as a contingency plan. Possibly Lenin recognised that his party's popularity lay in \nits promise to end the war, and that even a conditional prospect of \ncontinuing with the fighting would be unattractive. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Before 1917, Bukharin and Trotski objected to Lenin's \ndismissiveness towards the European peace movement. 39 The inclina-\ntion to talk about peace and play down the theme of a possible \nrevolutionary war grew stronger after the February Revolution, and \nLenin followed rather than led his colleagues in this.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred.43 \nThus not only Lenin but also his Central Committee associates \nlargely avoided a topic that would have damaged the party's \npopularity. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. There can be no definitive answer; but it is not \ninconceivable that, when writing privately in favour of revolutionary \nwar, he was not revealing his genuine intentions but felt that the time \nhad not yet arrived to convince his colleagues, especially those on the \nleft wing of the Bolshevik party, of the impracticability of prolonging \nmilitary engagement. Lenin did not inflate the balloon \nunnecessarily. \nIndeed, it may be wrong to assume that Lenin really had a firm \nand considered attitude to 'revolutionary war' in these months. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917.46 \nLenin's reasons for changing his emphasis are unclear.48 He may also have sensed that his \npolemics against the Provisional Government would be more biting if \nthe specifically Russian dimensions of governmental problems were \npin-pointed by the Bolsheviks. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment.50 \nNone the less Lenin's thinking had its incoherences as well as its \nexaggerations. \nKerenski, according to Lenin, was a puppet of London and Paris and \n To All the Peoples \n247 \nwas merely acceding to direct external pressure in instigating the June \noffensive on the Eastern front. 52 But Lenin would beat Kerenski with any stick that \nlay to hand. And he could perceive that it would do the Bolsheviks \nno harm if they put themselves forward as better protectors of the \nnational interest than were the Kadets, the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. 53 At any \nrate Lenin disowned the aim of seeking the dissolution of the Russian \narmed forces. Lenin, the \nunbending internationalist and harrier of all professed patriots, was \nsimultaneously standing forward as the only sure defender of Mother \nRussia. The German military danger, Kerenski's alleged \ntreason and the need to keep the Russian army in operational order \nwere themes helping to repudiate the accusation that Lenin and other \nBolshevik leaders were German agents. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. It would have been illogical to portray \nLenin as a devoted underling of Kaiser Wilhelm II while suggesting \nthat Lenin was aiming at the dissolution of the German Reich. The main accusers in the press, \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nVladimir Burtsev and Grigori Aleksinski, stated that Lenin had met \nup with Parvus on his trip back from Switzerland. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Aleksinski published a recorded list of \ntelegrams which had passed between Lenin (or other members of \nthe Ulyanov family in Petrograd) and Bolshevik representatives such \nas Hanecki, Radek and M. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry. 57 \nCertainly, German diplomacy had an interest in looking favour-\nably upon the party of Lenin. Bolshevik propaganda about peace \nassisted in increasing Russian weariness with the war; and politicians \nin Berlin knew that if the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, at the \nvery least a truce could be arranged on the Eastern front.58 \nLenin and Zinoviev maintained that their various accusers were \nmotivated by political spite. Their contention, expressed in a series of \nformal statements from April to July, was that personal defamation \nwas being used as a means of achieving the annihilation of the \nBolshevik party. And yet it does not amount to a refutation of the charge \nthat the Bolshevik Central Committee frequently and knowingly \nreceived donations from the German government.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them. \nNo moral considerations inhibited the Bolshevik Central Commit-\ntee from receiving a subsidy from anyone at all. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy.f both the Russian and German governments; and that the German \nauthorities' recklessness in assisting the Bolsheviks financially would \nnot alter his commitment to the strategy. Kerenski would treat the receipt of such monies \nby the Bolsheviks as high treason, and most Russian citizens would \nhave sympathised with Kerenski's assessment. Trial and even \nexecution of Lenin might easily follow. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection. \nSuch Bolsheviks were almost certainly unaware that much dirt might \nhave come out in the wash of a public trial. 70 \nYet account needs to be taken that German financial subventions \nwere not unique to the Bolsheviks.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). Attempts \nwere apparently made to do the same with non-Russian nationalists \nin the Russian empire. \nAnd yet Aleksinski and his friends, as well as their successors since \nthe Second World War, did not merely state that the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee received 'German gold'; they asserted that the \nfunds from Berlin were indispensable for the Bolshevik political \nadvance in 1917.74 \n To All the Peoples \n251 \nAleksinski, however, could not supply all the monetary details; and \nwe still do not know how much money arrived in the Bolshevik \nexchequer. Finances were in any case not the greatest difficulty for \nRussian parties in the months from March 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee obtained its \npremises in the Kshesinskaya Palace, but paid nothing for it and \nejected the owner, the ex-ballerina and court favourite M. Also, the 200-300,000 people who \njoined the Bolshevik party were expected to contribute to party \nfunds, 78 and Pravda, after its first issue, was not given away but sold. \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions. 79 In the following discussions with \nCentral Committee emissaries, Lenin insisted on returning to put his \ncase. She was married to the left-wing \n 252 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik Nikolai Sukhanov, whom she craftily persuaded not to \ncome home that night because the weather was so 'wretched'.80 Lenin \narrived bewigged and beardless. 82 Then Lenin spoke for an hour.83 The gist of Lenin's words, however, has survived. Again, he \ncontrasted mid-October with early July, arguing that 'the majority' \nwas behind the Bolsheviks.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'.86 Lenin \ndid not deny that 'the masses' had lately exhibited a certain \n'indifference' to high politics. 87 \nBefore such an audience, which was in closer touch than he with \ncurrent political developments, Lenin sought to argue that insurrec-\ntion was urgently required. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. Uritski, while being on the left of the Bolshevik \n To All the Peoples \n253 \nspectrum, asserted that the military force available for an insurrec-\ntion was insubstantial; but he took this as a reason for conducting \nstrenuous propaganda among the Petro grad garrison soldiers. After the Central Committee meeting they were to \ncompose a letter to various leading Bolshevik bodies; and its contents \npresumably give an indication of the arguments used by them at the \nmeeting itself. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two.93 None the less, Lenin had \nnot got quite everything his way: the suggestion that the transfer of \npower should take place at the northern regional soviet gathering was \nr~jected. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide. His \ncolleagues also felt that, even if an uprising in Minsk were to succeed \n(which was unlikely), a damaging impression would be given that \npower was passing not to the soviets in general but to a splinter \ngroup of soviets dominated by Bolsheviks.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. It also \nremained to be discovered how the rest of the Bolshevik party would \ntake to the Central Committee's line. Kamenev and Zinoviev \ndispatched their critical letter to the Petersburg and Moscow City \nCommittees as well as to other influential party bodies and fractions \ninside the soviets;96 they knew that other right-wing members of the \nCentral Committee - notably Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov - had not \nattended on 10 October: the hope was nurtured that a further debate \nmight pull Lenin back from the brink. The \nparty's local leaderships in cities as distant as Saratov were \ninformed. Nor do all the major city \ncommittees of the Bolshevik party seem to have been initiated into \nthe decision of 10 October. This possibly suited Lenin, since he knew \nhe had a strong chance of support from the Petrograd and Moscow \nleaderships. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established.98 \nLenin's two critics in the Central Committee, however, were \nreadying themselves for a last attempt to change the decision on \nthe seizure of power. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. Lenin, the key speaker, arrived late. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. Every other \nspeaker, including the Bolshevik rightist V. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. It also displayed a \nfeeling throughout Russian politics that Kerenski's government had \nlost its way; that Kerenski would not go quietly and would try to \ndisarm the soviets; that the Bolsheviks should not flinch in the \ncoming trial of strength. And so discussion shifted towards the \nquestion whether the Bolsheviks should initiate the clash. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Lenin \ncastigated both of them for ignoring 'objective conditions'. Lenin's sharp words did not \nhave an immediate effect. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. 112 \nIt was beginning to look as if the meeting regarded defence as the \nbest form of attack; and Zinoviev and Kamenev, sensing that their \nposition was not in fact irretrievable, restated their objection to \nLenin. His solution was to suggest that the \nforthcoming All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies be kept in permanent session until the Consti-\ntuent Assembly so as to pressurise the Assembly to carry out the \nappropriate decisions. Kamenev charged Lenin with forcing the \npolitical pace.' 114 \nBut several advocates of insurrection then took the floor: \nFenigstein, Stalin, Kalinin, Skrypnik, Dzierzynki, Ravich, Sokolni-\nkov, Skalov, Joffe, Shmidt, Latsis, S. Lenin had for \nmonths declared that only the Bolsheviks would dare to convoke the \nAssembly. Even so, only Ravich and \nSkrypnik took Lenin's ultra-impatient approach. Lenin's motion reaffirmed the 10 October decision and \n To All the Peoples \n257 \nexpressed 'complete confidence that the Central Committee and the \nSoviet would at the right time indicate the propitious moment and the \nappropriate methods of the offensive'. Uritski and Dzierzynski; all were instructed to \n'enter the membership of the revolutionary Soviet committee' . \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. The Soviet sanctioned its \nformation on 16 October, empowering it to co-ordinate the garrisons \nfor the capital's defence; 121 and the importance of the matter may \nexplain why Trotski, who had been chosen as Soviet chairman, was \nabsent from the Central Committee. When this Committee was selected on 20 \nOctober, its five-man Bureau included three Bolsheviks: Antonov-\nOvseenko, Podvoiski and Sadovski. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. \nLenin approved the Central Committee's choi \u00b7e of the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee as the organ of insurredion and wished to \nkeep its activities under review. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. Sverdlov main-\ntained contact with Podvoiski, whom he sent to Lenin - probably on \nsome date between 20 and 23 October. 122 Lenin conducted a \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngruelling interview since Podvoiski wanted the Bolshevik Military \nOrganisation to head the uprising. Lenin supported the Central \nCommittee in insisting that a non-party organ, the Petrograd \nSoviet's Military-Revolutionary Committee, should have charge. For the purposes of political presenta-\ntion it was vital that 'the Soviet' and not 'the party' was seen to be \nseizing power. 124 \nLenin was merely accentuating their point (and at last displaying the \ntactical subtlety which was to win him such renown); but his \nintervention put a useful check on Podvoiski. 125 He wanted no \nrepetition of the trouble caused by the Bureau of the Bolshevik \nMilitary Organisation in the July Days. Podvoiski got his own back \nby enquiring about Lenin's progress with 'the decrees on the land, on \npeace, on workers' control over production and on the organisation \nof the Soviet republic'. Kamenev and Zinoviev had dispatched an anti-Lenin letter to \nBolshevik party organisations; and, on 18 October, Kamenev \npublished a declaration against a seizure of power in the far-left \nsocialist but non-Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn (or 'New \nLife'). J3J Trotski had taken to suggesting that, if the \nBolsheviks took tg the streets, it would happen only in reaction to an \nattack by the Provisional Government; 132 and Zinoviev was attracted \nto such a proposition even though he knew that Trotski was using it \nmerely as a subterfuge. Stalin, Workers' Path editor, probably calculated also that \nZinoviev and Kamenev would help in restraining Lenin from too \nreckless a strategy in the days ahead. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Lenin's incaution had \nacquired deserved notoriety in August and September; his harangues \nin favour of action at any price could have cost the party dearly in \nOctober. The Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee continued preparations for an uprising \nwhenever the moment seemed ripe. The Bolshevik press in \nPetrograd warned constantly of the dangers posed by a resuscitation \nof Kornilovite conspiracies. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. There remained several Bolsheviks, not only in the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee but also in the\u00b7 party's City Committee, \nwho demanded an immediate seizure of power: Lenin was not the \nonly Leninist. The Central Committee leaned in favour of Trotski's \nsolution; and Stalin wrote in Workers' Path on 24 October about the \nneed for the Congress of Soviets to appoint a new government. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 134 \nLenin lived on in M. 136 Fofanova, who \nworked in the Bolshevik Central Committee Secretariat, implored \nhim not to venture out of doors. On 24 October, Kerenski tried to \nsuppress Bolshevik newspapers in the capital; police raids were \nfrequent. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. To the Central \nCommittee's delight, Kerenski's repressive demarche was widely \ntaken to authenticate the Bolshevik claim that they were simply \ndefending themselves when making their military dispositions. \nAnd yet the proffered help of one central figure, Lenin, was \nshrugged aside. Lenin sent out Fofanova several times to the Central \nCommittee in the Smolny Institute on 24 October with his pleas to be \nallowed out of hiding. \nHe covered part of his face with a bandage, positioned his trusty wig \non his head, grabbed his cap and went with Eino Rahja towards \nBolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. As the Bolsheviks and \ntheir supporters in the armed forces and the Red Guard spread their \npower through the capital, a surprised and dejected Kerenski made \nhis plans for escape from the cordon around the Winter Palace. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. 147 Lenin's tactical recommendations were therefore little \ndistinguishable from the Central Committee's current practice. Lenin \nsought to change this. It was Lenin's will to ensure that, when the delegatt:s \nassembled, power would already have been grasped from the \nProvisional Government; and, as soon as he reached the Institute, \nhe imparted this idea to his colleagues with characteristic insistence. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. Not only Trotski but also Lenin's opponents Kamenev \nand Zinoviev were present. 150 \nLenin, usually a punctiliously efficient person, still had not \nprepared the various 'theses' asked for by the Central Committee \non 21 October. Its contents are \nunknown; 152 but Lenin took over the final elaboration. Trotski, \nto general acclaim, suggested 'people's commissars'; and Lenin added \nthat the government could be called the 'Council of People's \nCommissars'. At 10 am Lenin decided that the \nmoment was appropriate to announce the regime's removal. State power had \npassed into the hands of tht\" organ of the Petrograd Soviet of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies: the Military-Revolutionary So-\nviet, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \ngarrison'. Lenin \npresumably wanted to have it recorded that the insurrection had been \nundertaken before the Congress met. He would have damaged his \nparty's interests if several days had intervened between insurrection \nand Congress; but the interim of a few hours was short enough for \nthe action still to appear as a true transfer of power to the soviets \nrather than to a single party. This interim, on the other hand, \nprevented any possible vacillation by the non-Bolshevik \u00b7delegates to \nthe Congress about Kerenski's overthrow; they would meet with a \nfait accompli. \nLenin's case for urgent measures was not entirely a figment of his \nfevered brain. The Bolsheviks, while knowing that they would \nconstitute by far the largest party at the Congress with around 300 \nout of 670 delegates, knew they would lack a clear majority. Lenin redoubled his demands for a storming of the \npalace, but the besieger. \nHis statement that Lenin was to address the Petrograd Soviet drew \n\\mremitting applause'. Trotski gave him a suitable introduction: \n'Long live comrade Lenin, who has now returned to us.' 158 Lenin, \nhardly identifiable without his moustache, spoke briefly on the \nprogramme of the as yet unformed Soviet government. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. An \nunnamed member of the audience interjected that the Bolshevik \nparty had improperly arrogated the rights of the Congress of Soviets. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. \nMartov, himself no great tactician, could scarcely believe that Dan \nand Chernov, who twenty four hours previously had endorsed \npolicies designed to bring about an immediate peace and an \nimmediate confiscation of gentry-owned land, would walk out of a \nCongress which was about to announce exactly such policies, and \nthat they would toss aside the opportunity to bargain with the \nBolsheviks about the composition of an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform.165 Martov rose, on the Congress floor, to call for a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict on Petrograd's streets, and for negotiations \nto produce a government consisting of all the parties represented in \nthe soviets. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Lunacharski, a member of the Novaya Zhizn group, who \nhad rejoined the Bolsheviks with the Interdistricters, declared that he \nhad 'absolutely no objection' to Martov's suggestion. The main-\nstream leaderships of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies, however, held to their plan; they castigated the Bolshevik-led \nviolence, demanded further negotiations with Kerenski and walked \nout. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. 169 \nEarlier in the year, there had been vituperative claims that Lenin \nhad returned to Russia to claim the long-vacant throne of the \nanarchist Bakunin. Such claims misread Lenin's intentions; for the \nstateless communities of anarchism were no part of the Bolshevik \nleader's intentions for the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the \npoorest peasants'. Even those who had made the claims, however, \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmust have been surprised by the lack of ceremony attendant upon \nLenin's 'coronation'. Lenin \nremained in Smolny for a while, but had not yet visited the Congress. The \nBolshevik fraction of the Congress of Soviets met to co-ordinate \ntactics. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. Lenin was busy in all of them: he \nhad returned to the centre of action. 172 The Second \nCongress of Soviets reconvened at 9 pm on 26 October. 173 \nFIRST WEEK, FIRST DECREES \nThe various pronouncements made by the Bolshevik leadership in the \nweek after the October seizure in Petrograd were of momentous \nsignificance in modern Russian history; and they also deserve \n To All the Peoples \n267 \nscrutiny inasmuch as their wording reveals much about the worries \nwhich the Bolshevik party leadership had about the political \nsituation. Lenin had previously been arguing that the party's \nsupporters would appreciate action better than words. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. Lenin stressed that several peasant delegates had been \npresent at the Congress. These were early days, and the Bolsheviks and their \nsupporters watched warily how the countryside would react to them. \nThe proclamation described the intentions of 'soviet power'. The forcible \n 268 \nLenin: A Political L(fe \nincorporation of 'small nationalities' was explicitly rejected. Yet \nLenin was not quite as incautious and lacking in guile as might \nappear. The \nreasons were not explained by Lenin. Lenin \nconsequently employed uncharacteristic vocabulary, describing the \ncontinuation of the War as 'the greatest crime against humanity'. 187 \nThis was as near as Lenin could go towards a call for international \nsocialist revolution without aggravating the already great risk that \nhis decree would not be published outside Russia. Furthermore, Lenin \n~sserted that the land of 'rank-and-file peasants' was not subject to \nconfiscation. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. Its name would be the Council of \nPeople's Commissars and 'Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)' was announced \nas its 'chairman' . The principal \nmeasure signalling the other side of Bolshevik intentions was the \nDecree on the Press which was published on 27 October. The Decree \non the Press made plain that the Soviet authorities under the \nBolsheviks would brook no fundamental opposition (and the \ncontemporaneous searches of houses and printing enterprises by \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee enforced the decree immedia-\ntely). Bolshevik spokesmen argued, as had Lenin in The State and \nRevolution that the propertied classes had always had an unfair \nadvantage in setting up newspapers, and that the use of the press \nshould not be confined mainly to the rich. Yet the basic intention to \nclose down anti-Bolshevik newspapers was only lightly veiled. Eventually, on 5 \nNovember, twelve days after the Petrograd uprising, Lenin released a \nstatement calling on workers to 'introduce the strictest control over \nproduction and accounts' and to arrest anyone found committing \nsabotage. Workers, along \nwith soldiers and peasants, were being encouraged to 'take all power \nin the localities into the hands of their soviets'.", "Missing_Is_Incontrovertible_1917": "", "Naval_Garrison_1917": " He was excited by the strikes in German cities in April 1917 \nand by the mutiny in the Kiel naval garrison in August. \nAssistance from the Kronstadt naval garrison was requested.", "International_Relations_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The difficulties are exemplified by his speeches, \narticles and letters about international relations. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own.4 His perspective was global, \nand he saw himself as having an international rather than a foreign \npolicy. 15 On the other hand, it remains \nremarkable that he offered only a few brief sentences on events which \nhad a great impact upon the military and political conflicts of 1917. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917. 55 \nTHE GERMAN CONNECTION \nLenin disclosed no reasons for this modified stance on international \nrelations. The fact that the \ngovernment offering the funds in 1917 was at war with the \ngovernment of one's own country was a matter of indifference for \nhim. Berlin engaged in political warfare \nin the First World War: arms and money were passed to Irish \nnationalists, who attempted to overthrow the British authorities in \nDublin in 1916 - and no one portrays such nationalists as mere \nagents of Germany. 73 Nor is it a uniquely \ntwentieth-century idea that a state should aid the enemy of the state's \nenemy. 179 For the first time in the First \nWorld War a major belligerent country's government called for a \nspeedy and omnilateral end to the fighting. 180 The \nSoviet authorities declared a wish to abandon secret diplomacy \nforever. \nIn addition, the fact that he expressed an appeal to 'peoples and \ntheir governments' indicated a break with the diplomatic practice \nwhich recognised only relations between governments or states; and a \nsection of the decree was devoted to a denunciation of secret \ndiplomacy and secret treaties.", "Bolshevik_Party_1917": " 8 \nTo All the Peoples: \nSeptember to October \n1917 \nINTERNATIONAL PROJECTS \nThe evaluation of Lenin as a party leader and national politician also \nentails consideration of factors of general significance. The specific \ncharacteristics of Bolshevik party life in 1917 must not be ignored, \nbut certain phenomena are common to nearly all modern political \nparties operating in multi-party systems. If these \ndifficulties are large in the late twentieth century, when the \n239 \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \ninstruments of the mass media are profusely available to political \nleaders, they were still larger in earlier decades. \nLenin's opponents, at the time and afterwards, focused upon his \ndelight in manipulative politics. Not only most workers, \nsoldiers and peasants but also even most rank-and-file Bolsheviks in \n1917 had barely heard of Karl Marx and knew little of the \ncomplexities of Russian and global politics. Furthermore, most \nBolsheviks had only recently become Bolsheviks. In the committees of the \nparty there was greater awareness, and Lenin needed to express \nhimself more sophisticatedly among activists and leaders in Petro-\ngrad. Ambiguity and \ninchoateness proliferated, but this partly derived from the reluctance \nof Lenin and other Bolsheviks to analyse developments in other \ncountries in much detail. Strictly speaking, Lenin had no 'foreign \n To All the Peoples \n241 \npolicy'. The Bolshevik party's concern with countries to the West \nrested with the project of European revolution. As an international-\nist, Lenin in spring and summer 1917 recognised no overt obligation \nto any single country, not even his own. In addition, the Bolshevik outlook was orientated upon \nclasses rather than upon political elites.6 \nHence the astounding neglectfulness of Lenin and most other \nBolsheviks for the vicissitudes of high politics in Germany, Britain, \nFrance and the USA. 7 Lenin regarded them as topics of distract-\ningly trivial importance beside the objective of international socialist \nrevolution.8 \nLenin was preoccupied by the search for signs of discontent in \nfactories and barracks in Germany. Lenin as a party \nboss aimed to convince his colleagues and rank-and-file Bolsheviks, if \nthey harboured doubts, that a seizure of power in Petrograd would \nquickly be followed by a fraternal revolution in Berlin. In any case he himself surely believed in his own \ncontention that the epoch of European socialist revolution was at \nhand, and that the Bolsheviks would be prominent in ushering in the \nnew age. 10 The \nBolshevik central newspaper kept a steady eye on such events as they \nbecame public news. 11 Its editors, as well as Lenin from his Finnish \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhiding place, frequently claimed that there was evidence of a 'growing \nrevolution' in Germany. Lenin was mistaking war-\nweariness and political discontent for a pan-European revolutionary \nsituation. Not only far-left socialists but \neven many conservative and liberal politicians, in the rest of Europe \nas well as in Russia, considered the disturbances to be signalling the \npossible outbreak of 'Red revolution': Bavaria and Hungary did, in \nfact, acquire revolutionary socialist administrations in 1919. \nNeither he nor his Bolshevik colleagues provided serious commen-\ntary upon the German submarine attacks on American shipping, or \nthe ensuing entry of the USA into the war on the side of the Allies. \n To All the Peoples \n243 \nWriters in the non-Bolshevik Russian press perceived these events \nas having a cardinal significance. 17 And yet not once did Lenin \nmention Michaelis by name. Calls \nby him and other Bolshevik Central Committee members for \n'fraternisation' between Russian and German soldiers corroborated \nthis dual conclusion among his enemies. 21 \nAnd so Lenin was obliged to enunciate what he would do if, \nshould he come to power, a European socialist revolution failed to \nensue. His usual gambit was to brush the matter aside by contending \nthat the Bolsheviks, simply by proposing a 'democratic peace' and \npublishing the secret treaties, would stimulate popular insurrections \nin Europe. Lenin frequently called \nTurkey and Persia to mind, 23 and in 1917 predicted that the \nEuropean imperial powers would face colonial revolts around the \nworld once a socialist government had announced its existence in \nRussia. 24 References by him and by Stalin to the importance of non-\nEuropean nationalism marked them off from several other leading \nBolshevik strategists. Even Bukharin and other \nBolsheviks who, unlike Lenin, had always recognised the deeply-felt \npatriotism of the German working class in 1914, concurred. It was an \narticle of Bolshevik faith. 27 \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOpponents nagged away that the Bolsheviks needed a policy for \nthe contingency that the European socialist revolution might not \noccur. In mid-May 1917, Lenin gave them his old answer in Pravda: \n'Then we should have to complete preparations for and wage a \nrevolutionary war. were \nto place us in the situation of a revolutionary war', the Bolsheviks \nwould not refuse the challenge;29 and in his second speech five days \nlater he announced that 'in certain circumstances we cannot get by \nwithout revolutionary war'. 30 \nHis words clash with what was to become Bolshevik policy in \nMarch 1918; there is an obvious contradiction between the Lenin of \n1917 who fulminated against any notion of a separate peace with \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and the Lenin of 1918 who insisted \non the signature of exactly such a peace. Lenin's statements \nimplied that the Bolsheviks would fight only if circumstances forced \ntheir hand; and he eschewed any indication about the timing of such \na war. 33 In the second place, the circumstances of Lenin's remarks \ndeserve scrutiny. His Pravda articles and his speeches to the First \nSoviet Congress were framed as a response to the allegations that the \nBolsheviks would sign a separate treaty with Germany. \nConsequently, most Bolsheviks did not know that 'revolutionary \nwar' had ever been among Lenin's proposals. \nSuch rank-and-filers were a tiny proportion of the fast-growing mass \nparty of midsummer and autumn 1917. Possibly Lenin recognised that his party's popularity lay in \nits promise to end the war, and that even a conditional prospect of \ncontinuing with the fighting would be unattractive. Other far-left \nsocialists had been reticent about war talk for much longer than \nLenin. Before 1917, Bukharin and Trotski objected to Lenin's \ndismissiveness towards the European peace movement. 39 The inclina-\ntion to talk about peace and play down the theme of a possible \nrevolutionary war grew stronger after the February Revolution, and \nLenin followed rather than led his colleagues in this.41 In June, July and \nAugust there was barely a mention of 'revolutionary war', and the \nfew examples by individual leading Bolsheviks were typically tied to \ndenials of the intention to sign a separate peace.42 Even so, most \nleading Bolsheviks privately remained committed to revolutionary \nwar if no European revolution occurred.43 \nThus not only Lenin but also his Central Committee associates \nlargely avoided a topic that would have damaged the party's \npopularity. But did \nLenin, even in 1917, really have the same approach as the majority of \nhis associates. There can be no definitive answer; but it is not \ninconceivable that, when writing privately in favour of revolutionary \nwar, he was not revealing his genuine intentions but felt that the time \nhad not yet arrived to convince his colleagues, especially those on the \nleft wing of the Bolshevik party, of the impracticability of prolonging \nmilitary engagement. Lenin did not inflate the balloon \nunnecessarily. \nIndeed, it may be wrong to assume that Lenin really had a firm \nand considered attitude to 'revolutionary war' in these months. \nPerhaps, since he genuinely believed in the imminence of European \nsocialist revolution, he felt no need to work out a detailed \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontingency policy. Not that \nLenin's thinking on international relations became stagnant before \nOctober 1917.48 He may also have sensed that his \npolemics against the Provisional Government would be more biting if \nthe specifically Russian dimensions of governmental problems were \npin-pointed by the Bolsheviks. \nThe Provisional Government, for Lenin, remained a capitalist \ngovernment.50 \nNone the less Lenin's thinking had its incoherences as well as its \nexaggerations. \nKerenski, according to Lenin, was a puppet of London and Paris and \n To All the Peoples \n247 \nwas merely acceding to direct external pressure in instigating the June \noffensive on the Eastern front. 52 But Lenin would beat Kerenski with any stick that \nlay to hand. And he could perceive that it would do the Bolsheviks \nno harm if they put themselves forward as better protectors of the \nnational interest than were the Kadets, the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. 53 At any \nrate Lenin disowned the aim of seeking the dissolution of the Russian \narmed forces. Lenin, the \nunbending internationalist and harrier of all professed patriots, was \nsimultaneously standing forward as the only sure defender of Mother \nRussia. The German military danger, Kerenski's alleged \ntreason and the need to keep the Russian army in operational order \nwere themes helping to repudiate the accusation that Lenin and other \nBolshevik leaders were German agents. \nMost non-Bolshevik socialist commentators did not credit the \nBolshevik central leadership with a genuine wish to inaugurate a pan-\nEuropean socialist revolution. The main accusers in the press, \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nVladimir Burtsev and Grigori Aleksinski, stated that Lenin had met \nup with Parvus on his trip back from Switzerland. Without a German \nsubsidy, they claimed, the Bolsheviks would not have been in a \nposition to acquire their various printing presses and other facilities \nin the early days of the February Revolution: Pravda had appeared \nfrom early March 1917. Aleksinski published a recorded list of \ntelegrams which had passed between Lenin (or other members of \nthe Ulyanov family in Petrograd) and Bolshevik representatives such \nas Hanecki, Radek and M. Here we \narrive at the source of the legend that the Bolsheviks would never \nhave come to power in Petrograd without having been funded by the \nGerman foreign ministry. 57 \nCertainly, German diplomacy had an interest in looking favour-\nably upon the party of Lenin. Bolshevik propaganda about peace \nassisted in increasing Russian weariness with the war; and politicians \nin Berlin knew that if the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, at the \nvery least a truce could be arranged on the Eastern front.58 \nLenin and Zinoviev maintained that their various accusers were \nmotivated by political spite. Their contention, expressed in a series of \nformal statements from April to July, was that personal defamation \nwas being used as a means of achieving the annihilation of the \nBolshevik party. And yet it does not amount to a refutation of the charge \nthat the Bolshevik Central Committee frequently and knowingly \nreceived donations from the German government.63 What is \nmissing is incontrovertible proof that the money was aimed \nspecifically at the Bolsheviks in the months between the February \nand October Revolutions, and that it reached them. \nNo moral considerations inhibited the Bolshevik Central Commit-\ntee from receiving a subsidy from anyone at all.66 Every revolutionary party needed money. \nIn 1900 the Russian Marxists had received funds from Russian \nliberal figures even though Lenin and his friends thought liberals to \nbe likely, in a future political crisis, to make a deal with the absolute \nmonarchy.f both the Russian and German governments; and that the German \nauthorities' recklessness in assisting the Bolsheviks financially would \nnot alter his commitment to the strategy. Kerenski would treat the receipt of such monies \nby the Bolsheviks as high treason, and most Russian citizens would \nhave sympathised with Kerenski's assessment. Trial and even \nexecution of Lenin might easily follow. Not even all Bolsheviks \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwould necessarily approve of the German connection. \nSuch Bolsheviks were almost certainly unaware that much dirt might \nhave come out in the wash of a public trial. 70 \nYet account needs to be taken that German financial subventions \nwere not unique to the Bolsheviks.71 In addition, the German archives show that \nfunds had also been available for transfer to Russia's Socialist \nRevolutionaries before the February Revolution (even though their \nCentral Committee does not seem to have been involved). Attempts \nwere apparently made to do the same with non-Russian nationalists \nin the Russian empire. \nAnd yet Aleksinski and his friends, as well as their successors since \nthe Second World War, did not merely state that the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee received 'German gold'; they asserted that the \nfunds from Berlin were indispensable for the Bolshevik political \nadvance in 1917.74 \n To All the Peoples \n251 \nAleksinski, however, could not supply all the monetary details; and \nwe still do not know how much money arrived in the Bolshevik \nexchequer. Finances were in any case not the greatest difficulty for \nRussian parties in the months from March 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee obtained its \npremises in the Kshesinskaya Palace, but paid nothing for it and \nejected the owner, the ex-ballerina and court favourite M. Also, the 200-300,000 people who \njoined the Bolshevik party were expected to contribute to party \nfunds, 78 and Pravda, after its first issue, was not given away but sold. \nBolshevik officials, as the party gathered political backing, were able \nto get paid jobs in the soviets, the trade unions and the factory-\nworkshop committees. And the material conditions and political \nworries affecting workers, soldiers and sailors and disposing them to \nlook for a radical socialist party to solve their problems existed \nindependently of Bolshevik instigation. A German governmental \nsubsidy may have helped the Bolsheviks, but it cannot have been \n'the key' to the party's political success in 1917. \nTHE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE \nLenin would have been the last person to think that money was more \nimportant than party organisation in making revolutions. 79 In the following discussions with \nCentral Committee emissaries, Lenin insisted on returning to put his \ncase. She was married to the left-wing \n 252 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMenshevik Nikolai Sukhanov, whom she craftily persuaded not to \ncome home that night because the weather was so 'wretched'.80 Lenin \narrived bewigged and beardless. 82 Then Lenin spoke for an hour.83 The gist of Lenin's words, however, has survived. Again, he \ncontrasted mid-October with early July, arguing that 'the majority' \nwas behind the Bolsheviks.84 He even acknowledged that the party \nwould not win the Constituent Assembly ballot since the peasants \nwere by far the largest section of the population and could not be \nexpected to vote Bolshevik;85 but he repeated that this did not matter \nsince 'the agrarian movement' could no longer be suppressed by the \nProvisional Government, and that both the Bolshevik party and the \npeasantry agreed on the necessity of 'a transfer of power'. 87 \nBefore such an audience, which was in closer touch than he with \ncurrent political developments, Lenin sought to argue that insurrec-\ntion was urgently required. \nHence, according to Lenin, the need for a pre-emptive uprising. Uritski, while being on the left of the Bolshevik \n To All the Peoples \n253 \nspectrum, asserted that the military force available for an insurrec-\ntion was insubstantial; but he took this as a reason for conducting \nstrenuous propaganda among the Petro grad garrison soldiers. After the Central Committee meeting they were to \ncompose a letter to various leading Bolshevik bodies; and its contents \npresumably give an indication of the arguments used by them at the \nmeeting itself. And Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed \nwith Lenin that the Bolsheviks would not win the Constituent \nAssembly elections; but they concluded that popular opinion would \ncompel the so-called 'petit-bourgeois parties' (as the Bolsheviks \ndescribed the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries) to \n'seek out a union with the proletarian party against the gentry \nlandlords and the capitalists'. Kamenev and Zinoviev also reminded the \nCentral Committee that the soldiers presently voting for the \nBolsheviks would withdraw support if the party, in the absence of \na European socialist revolution, engaged in a revolutionary war; and \nthat the evidence that such a revolution was imminent was lacking.91 \nYet the Central Committee solidly took Lenin's side, by a margin \nof ten to two.93 None the less, Lenin had \nnot got quite everything his way: the suggestion that the transfer of \npower should take place at the northern regional soviet gathering was \nr~jected. Lenin, who preached that insurrection was 'an art', was \nthought to be inviting the party to commit political suicide. His \ncolleagues also felt that, even if an uprising in Minsk were to succeed \n(which was unlikely), a damaging impression would be given that \npower was passing not to the soviets in general but to a splinter \ngroup of soviets dominated by Bolsheviks.95 \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSo Lenin had carried off a crushing strategical victory. It also \nremained to be discovered how the rest of the Bolshevik party would \ntake to the Central Committee's line. Kamenev and Zinoviev \ndispatched their critical letter to the Petersburg and Moscow City \nCommittees as well as to other influential party bodies and fractions \ninside the soviets;96 they knew that other right-wing members of the \nCentral Committee - notably Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov - had not \nattended on 10 October: the hope was nurtured that a further debate \nmight pull Lenin back from the brink. The \nparty's local leaderships in cities as distant as Saratov were \ninformed. Nor do all the major city \ncommittees of the Bolshevik party seem to have been initiated into \nthe decision of 10 October. This possibly suited Lenin, since he knew \nhe had a strong chance of support from the Petrograd and Moscow \nleaderships. Through-\nout the Bolshevik party there was a growing sense that the time for \nthe installation of a socialist administration had arrived; and even \nKamenev and Zinoviev concurred that a socialist regime should \nquickly be established. Representatives from Bolshevik party \ncommittees and soviet and trade union organs in Petrograd were to \nbe present; Kamenev and Zinoviev (who felt buoyed up this time by \nthe presence of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov) hoped to win them over \nto a more cautious strategy for the advance to socialism. Lenin, the key speaker, arrived late. 103 Lenin's commitment \nto mass political participation and to respect for the popular will had \nnot been absolute even before the July Days. Every other \nspeaker, including the Bolshevik rightist V. 109 The \nfailure of Milyutin, Nogin and Rykov to take a stand unequivocally \n~gainst the Central Committee decision of 10 October was emble-\nmatic of a shift in opinion among Bolsheviks. It also displayed a \nfeeling throughout Russian politics that Kerenski's government had \nlost its way; that Kerenski would not go quietly and would try to \ndisarm the soviets; that the Bolsheviks should not flinch in the \ncoming trial of strength. And so discussion shifted towards the \nquestion whether the Bolsheviks should initiate the clash. Milyutin \n 256 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthought not, and argued against insurrection. Krylenko, a leftist Bolshevik, argued \nthat the party should support any insurrection but not organise one \nin the first instance: a curious standpoint for a Military Bureau \nmember. His solution was to suggest that the \nforthcoming All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies be kept in permanent session until the Consti-\ntuent Assembly so as to pressurise the Assembly to carry out the \nappropriate decisions. Kamenev charged Lenin with forcing the \npolitical pace. Lenin had for \nmonths declared that only the Bolsheviks would dare to convoke the \nAssembly. Lenin's motion reaffirmed the 10 October decision and \n To All the Peoples \n257 \nexpressed 'complete confidence that the Central Committee and the \nSoviet would at the right time indicate the propitious moment and the \nappropriate methods of the offensive'. Uritski and Dzierzynski; all were instructed to \n'enter the membership of the revolutionary Soviet committee' . \nThe idea of a Military-Revolutionary Committee had been debated \nby the Petrograd Soviet on 9 October. When this Committee was selected on 20 \nOctober, its five-man Bureau included three Bolsheviks: Antonov-\nOvseenko, Podvoiski and Sadovski. The remaining two members, \nLaasimer and Sukharkov, were left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries. \nLenin approved the Central Committee's choi \u00b7e of the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee as the organ of insurredion and wished to \nkeep its activities under review. Fofanova, who worked for the \nBolshevik Central Committee, in the Vyborg district. Sverdlov main-\ntained contact with Podvoiski, whom he sent to Lenin - probably on \nsome date between 20 and 23 October. 122 Lenin conducted a \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngruelling interview since Podvoiski wanted the Bolshevik Military \nOrganisation to head the uprising. Lenin supported the Central \nCommittee in insisting that a non-party organ, the Petrograd \nSoviet's Military-Revolutionary Committee, should have charge. For the purposes of political presenta-\ntion it was vital that 'the Soviet' and not 'the party' was seen to be \nseizing power. 124 \nLenin was merely accentuating their point (and at last displaying the \ntactical subtlety which was to win him such renown); but his \nintervention put a useful check on Podvoiski. 125 He wanted no \nrepetition of the trouble caused by the Bureau of the Bolshevik \nMilitary Organisation in the July Days. Podvoiski got his own back \nby enquiring about Lenin's progress with 'the decrees on the land, on \npeace, on workers' control over production and on the organisation \nof the Soviet republic'. Kamenev and Zinoviev had dispatched an anti-Lenin letter to \nBolshevik party organisations; and, on 18 October, Kamenev \npublished a declaration against a seizure of power in the far-left \nsocialist but non-Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn (or 'New \nLife'). J3J Trotski had taken to suggesting that, if the \nBolsheviks took tg the streets, it would happen only in reaction to an \nattack by the Provisional Government; 132 and Zinoviev was attracted \nto such a proposition even though he knew that Trotski was using it \nmerely as a subterfuge. The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee needed to stay in touch with movements of opinion in \nthe garrison and the industrial suburbs and to monitor the \nProvisional Government's security measures. Lenin's incaution had \nacquired deserved notoriety in August and September; his harangues \nin favour of action at any price could have cost the party dearly in \nOctober. The Petrograd Soviet's Military-\nRevolutionary Committee continued preparations for an uprising \nwhenever the moment seemed ripe. The Bolshevik press in \nPetrograd warned constantly of the dangers posed by a resuscitation \nof Kornilovite conspiracies. A Bolshevik-led coup was the daily \nspeculative fare of the other newspapers; the main substance of their \nguess-work was not whether the Bolsheviks would revolt but whether \ntheir power would last for very long after their rebellion. Delegates to \nthe Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and \nSoldiers' Deputies were arriving in Petrograd; the Bolsheviks were \nalready sure that a majority would be held by those socialists who \nopposed coalition with the Kadets and wanted a solidly socialist \nadministration. There remained several Bolsheviks, not only in the Military-\nRevolutionary Committee but also in the\u00b7 party's City Committee, \nwho demanded an immediate seizure of power: Lenin was not the \nonly Leninist. The Central Committee leaned in favour of Trotski's \nsolution; and Stalin wrote in Workers' Path on 24 October about the \nneed for the Congress of Soviets to appoint a new government. Thus \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nit would be hard for the anti-Bolshevik groups to claim that the \nmilitary action was merely a Bolshevik coup. 134 \nLenin lived on in M. 136 Fofanova, who \nworked in the Bolshevik Central Committee Secretariat, implored \nhim not to venture out of doors. On 24 October, Kerenski tried to \nsuppress Bolshevik newspapers in the capital; police raids were \nfrequent. 139 \nTrotski, encouraged by the left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries in \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee, wished to avoid seizing \npower until the opening of the Congress of Soviets. To the Central \nCommittee's delight, Kerenski's repressive demarche was widely \ntaken to authenticate the Bolshevik claim that they were simply \ndefending themselves when making their military dispositions. \nAnd yet the proffered help of one central figure, Lenin, was \nshrugged aside. Lenin sent out Fofanova several times to the Central \nCommittee in the Smolny Institute on 24 October with his pleas to be \nallowed out of hiding. As the Bolsheviks and \ntheir supporters in the armed forces and the Red Guard spread their \npower through the capital, a surprised and dejected Kerenski made \nhis plans for escape from the cordon around the Winter Palace. 146 \nThe October Revolution in Petrograd on 25 October 1917 was \nviolent, but, by the standards of revolutions, fairly bloodless. Lenin's \ni~pact was considerable, but not as great on the day of the uprising \nor on the preparatory tactics as it had been on the Central \nCommittee's original decisions of 10 and 16 October. The crucial \nfigures were Trotski in the Petrograd Soviet, Sverdlov in the Central \nCommittee and Dzierzynski and Antonov-Ovseenko and their \ncolleagues in the Military-Revolutionary Committee -\nnot to \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmention those hundreds of local Bolsheviks and their sympathisers in \nPetrograd who used their initiative and took decisions in their own \ndistricts. The Bolsheviks at the \nSmolny Institute, moreover, were aware that power was more or less \nalready theirs. Lenin \nsought to change this. 148 Lenin demanded, inspired, \nenergised. Not only Trotski but also Lenin's opponents Kamenev \nand Zinoviev were present. 150 \nLenin, usually a punctiliously efficient person, still had not \nprepared the various 'theses' asked for by the Central Committee \non 21 October. Its contents are \nunknown; 152 but Lenin took over the final elaboration. Trotski, \nto general acclaim, suggested 'people's commissars'; and Lenin added \nthat the government could be called the 'Council of People's \nCommissars'. At 10 am Lenin decided that the \nmoment was appropriate to announce the regime's removal. State power had \npassed into the hands of tht\" organ of the Petrograd Soviet of \nWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies: the Military-Revolutionary So-\nviet, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \ngarrison'. Lenin \npresumably wanted to have it recorded that the insurrection had been \nundertaken before the Congress met. This interim, on the other hand, \nprevented any possible vacillation by the non-Bolshevik \u00b7delegates to \nthe Congress about Kerenski's overthrow; they would meet with a \nfait accompli. The Bolsheviks, while knowing that they would \nconstitute by far the largest party at the Congress with around 300 \nout of 670 delegates, knew they would lack a clear majority. A Petrograd \nSoviet session opened at 2. \nHis statement that Lenin was to address the Petrograd Soviet drew \n\\mremitting applause'. Trotski gave him a suitable introduction: \n'Long live comrade Lenin, who has now returned to us.' 158 Lenin, \nhardly identifiable without his moustache, spoke briefly on the \nprogramme of the as yet unformed Soviet government. For the while, the appearance of Bolshevik political \nunity was maintained. An \nunnamed member of the audience interjected that the Bolshevik \nparty had improperly arrogated the rights of the Congress of Soviets. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Menshevik Inter-\nnationalists decided to convene separately from their respective \nparties; both these leftist groups of anti-Bolsheviks felt it would be \ncounter-productive to abandon the Congress of Soviets to the \nBolsheviks. \nMartov, himself no great tactician, could scarcely believe that Dan \nand Chernov, who twenty four hours previously had endorsed \npolicies designed to bring about an immediate peace and an \nimmediate confiscation of gentry-owned land, would walk out of a \nCongress which was about to announce exactly such policies, and \nthat they would toss aside the opportunity to bargain with the \nBolsheviks about the composition of an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment. Fourteen \nBolsheviks, led by Trotski, and seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ntook the platform.165 Martov rose, on the Congress floor, to call for a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict on Petrograd's streets, and for negotiations \nto produce a government consisting of all the parties represented in \nthe soviets. Most delegates to the Congress, including many \nBolsheviks, had come to the capital' with the intention of creating \njust such a coalition government. 167 The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary, S. Lunacharski, a member of the Novaya Zhizn group, who \nhad rejoined the Bolsheviks with the Interdistricters, declared that he \nhad 'absolutely no objection' to Martov's suggestion. The main-\nstream leaderships of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionar-\nies, however, held to their plan; they castigated the Bolshevik-led \nviolence, demanded further negotiations with Kerenski and walked \nout. Their departure at last left the Bolsheviks with an absolute \nmajority at the Congress and with a freer hand to influence the make-\nup of the next government. 169 \nEarlier in the year, there had been vituperative claims that Lenin \nhad returned to Russia to claim the long-vacant throne of the \nanarchist Bakunin. Such claims misread Lenin's intentions; for the \nstateless communities of anarchism were no part of the Bolshevik \nleader's intentions for the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the \npoorest peasants'. Even those who had made the claims, however, \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmust have been surprised by the lack of ceremony attendant upon \nLenin's 'coronation'. Lenin \nremained in Smolny for a while, but had not yet visited the Congress. The \nBolshevik fraction of the Congress of Soviets met to co-ordinate \ntactics. The Military-Revolutionary Committee met and then the \nBolshevik fraction met with the Left Socialist-Revolutionary fraction \nin a vain effort to bring about a two-party soviet government. The \nBolshevik Central Committee met. Lenin was busy in all of them: he \nhad returned to the centre of action. 172 The Second \nCongress of Soviets reconvened at 9 pm on 26 October. 173 \nFIRST WEEK, FIRST DECREES \nThe various pronouncements made by the Bolshevik leadership in the \nweek after the October seizure in Petrograd were of momentous \nsignificance in modern Russian history; and they also deserve \n To All the Peoples \n267 \nscrutiny inasmuch as their wording reveals much about the worries \nwhich the Bolshevik party leadership had about the political \nsituation. Lenin had previously been arguing that the party's \nsupporters would appreciate action better than words. An outline \nof the hopes and intentions of the revolutionary socialist administra-\ntion was urgently required for both Russia and the world, and \nLenin's literary fluency was put to intensive use. Lenin stressed that several peasant delegates had been \npresent at the Congress. These were early days, and the Bolsheviks and their \nsupporters watched warily how the countryside would react to them. \nThe proclamation described the intentions of 'soviet power'. The forcible \n 268 \nLenin: A Political L(fe \nincorporation of 'small nationalities' was explicitly rejected. Yet \nLenin was not quite as incautious and lacking in guile as might \nappear. The \nreasons were not explained by Lenin. 187 \nThis was as near as Lenin could go towards a call for international \nsocialist revolution without aggravating the already great risk that \nhis decree would not be published outside Russia. Furthermore, Lenin \n~sserted that the land of 'rank-and-file peasants' was not subject to \nconfiscation. The new govern-\n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nment wanted the peasants to get on with their own revolution with \nthe minimum of interference from the towns. A party resting its main \nhopes upon the support of the urban working class was directing its \nfirst major social reform, not to the workers but to the peasants: it is \nyet another indication of the worries of the Bolsheviks in the first \nweeks of their power. Its name would be the Council of \nPeople's Commissars and 'Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)' was announced \nas its 'chairman' . The principal \nmeasure signalling the other side of Bolshevik intentions was the \nDecree on the Press which was published on 27 October. The Decree \non the Press made plain that the Soviet authorities under the \nBolsheviks would brook no fundamental opposition (and the \ncontemporaneous searches of houses and printing enterprises by \nthe Military-Revolutionary Committee enforced the decree immedia-\ntely). Bolshevik spokesmen argued, as had Lenin in The State and \nRevolution that the propertied classes had always had an unfair \nadvantage in setting up newspapers, and that the use of the press \nshould not be confined mainly to the rich. Yet the basic intention to \nclose down anti-Bolshevik newspapers was only lightly veiled. Eventually, on 5 \nNovember, twelve days after the Petrograd uprising, Lenin released a \nstatement calling on workers to 'introduce the strictest control over \nproduction and accounts' and to arrest anyone found committing \nsabotage. Workers, along \nwith soldiers and peasants, were being encouraged to 'take all power \nin the localities into the hands of their soviets'.", "Bolshevik_Party_1920": " \nLENIN AND TROTSKJ \nBolsheviks wanted the Soviet state to guide all public and private \ninstitutions in their expanding republic. \nThe Bolshevik party had expounded such an ambition soon after the \nOctober Revolution, and elaborated it in its party programme at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919. Even among Bolsheviks there \nwere inhibitions about the desirable scope of the state's pretensions. \nThe October Revolution was meant, in Lenin's words, to introduce a \ndictatorship of the proletariat. The fact that the party had used \nviolence against the working class had not eradicated a feeling among \nBolsheviks that the interests of the workers should be protected. Leading Bolshevik \ntrade unionists, such as Central Committee member Mikhail Tomski, \nwere comfortable with the notion of a one-party and one-ideology \nstate. Lenin despaired of his Politburo and Red Army colleague. There \nhad been assaults on Lenin's management of both the Polish campaign \nand the party's internal affairs, and a resolution had been passed on the \nneed to reform party organisation. Lenin coped with the Conference by \nputting it out of his mind as soon as the delegates went home. In Lenin's estimation, these were the issues requiring urgent \nattention.3 \nLenin, however, had luck inasmuch as his policy neither necessitated \nan unsettling change in the measures of the day nor confronted \nparticularly fearsome adversaries; for the Democratic Centralists and \nWorkers' Opposition did not much trouble him. Lenin, as he had shown in controversy after controversy before the \nGreat War and would show again in the foreign-trade discussion of \n1922, was even more likely to act in such a fashion. His abrasiveness \ntowards the Democratic Centralists and Workers' Opposition did not \ncease, and he remained unapologetic about the political departments \nwhich had been castigated at the Ninth Party Conference by many \nlocal committee men who otherwise supported the Lenin-Trotski \nleadership. Lenin would tolerate him no \nmore. Tomski returned from the Conference of Trade Unions, where \nhe had officially represented the Bolshevik Central Committee, and \n Less Politics. 11 But Zinoviev was \nnot a reconciler and Tomski had had a blazing polemic with Trotski at \nthe Congress of Trade Unions; 12 Rykov had been the butt ofTrotski's \nsarcasm at the Ninth Party Congress; 13 Artem had previously hugged \nclose to Lenin. These were \non the 'left' of the Bolshevik political spectrum: Bukharin, Dzierzynski, \nKrestinski, Radek and Serebryakov. Lenin was forced to back off. 16 \nThe commission's composition was balanced equally between Lenin \nand Trotski. Lenin was represented by Rudzutak, Trotski by himself. His espousal of moderate reform at the \nNinth Party Conference in September 1920 was unaccompanied by \nimplementation in his own political base in Petrograd. 19 Like all the \nBolshevik leaders, he had a genuine ideological commitment. \n 156 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski refused to participate in the charade. \nThis time he was more aggressive than Lenin. Lenin had gained a new ally in the person of Zinoviev.22 But the stand-off between Lenin and \nTrotski meant that his reduced group held the balance of power in the \nCentral Committee; and, although not all of the group's members liked \nhis specific slogan, it was sufficiently vague to allow them to force it \nthrough as Central Committee policy. Lenin was as \nannoyed with Bukharin in 1920 as with Trotski two years previously. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. \nLenin remained extraordinarily complacent. It was \nKalinin, not Lenin, who insisted on 14 September that the Politburo \nshould establish a commission of enquiry into the conditions of the \npeasantry.28 \nVisiting peasants, however, did not let Lenin forget them. By pitching the workers against the peasants, Lenin was setting \nup a situation like the fight between the goat and the ram, in which the \nlynx, whom Belyaev likened to world capitalism, could be the \nbeneficiary.30 Lenin's defence of official policy was not quite as \ndogged as usual. 31 Lenin hoped to indicate that the Politburo was mindful of the \npeasantry's distress. \nLenin rejoiced. \nThis gave Lenin the chance to re-think War Communism.38 In the Civil War the Bolsheviks had exacted taxes, \ngrain and conscripts from village communes as a whole. Compensation on an individual basis was thought to \nsmack of indulgence to the kulak; and, even though the committees of \nthe village poor were disbanded in Russia in December 1918, class \nstruggle in the countryside remained the state's conscious objective. Let \nus be clear about Lenin's new thinking.40 \nOn the same day Lenin gave a report to the Bolshevik fraction on \nforeign concessionnaires.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. Not only the Workers' \nOpposition but many other Bolshevik speakers saw concessions as a \nbetrayal of the Revolution, the proletariat, Marx and communism.44 \nLenin had greatly misjudged the adaptiveness of his party. Having been \nlate in perceiving the dire condition of the economy, he had failed to \nprepare the minds of his fellow party activists before the Congress of \nSoviets. Lenin trimmed his report on behalf of \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSovnarkom of those aspects which had been most contentious. Disagreements in the \nCentral Committee about the trade unions were being aired at the \nCongress of Soviets; and Bolshevik delegates had to be carefully \ncourted if the Congress was not to turn into a fiasco. The wartime \npressures for party unity were waning. Strife returned to the Bolsheviks \nwith a vengeance. In vain did Lenin propose that 'the best politics \nhenceforward will be less politics'.45 \nWhat saved him from humiliation was the unreadiness of Bolsheviks \nto undo him in front of the small number of Mensheviks, Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Left SRs at the Congress. The Bolshevik party's \nmonopoly was not yet total, not quite. Solidarity of some basic kind \nwith the party leader was essential. Furthermore, it did Lenin no harm \nthat these other socialist parties were asking for a reform of economic \npolicy more basic than Lenin's proposal.46 \nLenin dissociated himself from such an abandonment of War \nCommunism. He railed against peasants who became involved in what \nthe Bolsheviks called speculation.47 \nBut Lenin was still not out of the woods. Polemics on the agrarian \nquestion were almost inevitable even when Bolshevik delegates to the \nCongress were on their best behaviour. On 24 December, Lenin \nrepeated to a Bolshevik fraction meeting that a turn towards 'the \npeasant individual economy' was required.49 Even \nLenin, however, was taken aback at the vituperative discussion which \nensued. Despite his best efforts, the Bolshevik fraction at the Congress \nrejected the Lenin-Preobrazhenski proposals on the grounds that they \nfavoured only the kulak. Lenin was angry. \nThe Central Committee met in the emergency on 27 December, and \nLenin described in graphic detail how truculent the Bolshevik delegates \n Less Politics. \nLenin was empowered to go back to the fraction to re-assert the policy \nof the Central Committee.51 Lenin was \njaunty.55 In the Politburo, unbeknownst to \nthe rest of the party, there persisted the dispute about concessions. 57 \nAll was turmoil for Lenin, including his more intimate life. Lenin was present and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfollowed the coffin through the cold, snow-laden streets.' 58 Lenin and Inessa probably had a sexual liaison \nof some kind before the Great War, and the emotional tie persisted.62 Whether Lenin reciprocated her attitude to him is not \nknown for certain. \n163 \ndiscussion', commenced on 30 December under the gaze of the \nBolshevik party fraction at the Congress of Soviets. Lenin and \nZinoviev stood together against Trotski. Lenin \nconcentrated his fire on Trotski.' Lenin declared that the working class still needed unions to \nprotect its interests. 67 \nLenin emphasised, in an off-the-cuff remark, that the Soviet state \nwas 'not a workers' but a workers' -and-peasants'' state. Bukharin obviously thought that he \ndetected a theoretical gaff, and made an interjection to Lenin's speech: \na rare occurrence by 1920. Before the October Revolution, Lenin had called for the \ninception of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest \npeasantry'. But Lenin disdained to enter \ndebate on the topic. \u00b7n \nLenin had come upon a formula that would see off his adversaries: it \nconveyed pride in the results of the October Revolution while \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that the workers had a continuing need of protection by \ntrade unions.76 The underlying explanation is that \nLenin stood for party unity and was able to portray Trotski as a \nsplitter. Trotski reacted \nby claiming that Lenin's indulgence to the unions was a rhetorical ploy. \nTo a large extent Trotski was right (even though it is equally true that \nLenin was hostile to the extreme anti-unionism of Trotski). And yet \nBolsheviks in the localities faced conditions which could no longer be \nhandled exclusively by command and violence. Yuri Milonov, the \nSamara provincial party leader was unwitting to call for the \nabrogation of the party's dominance over the soviets and trade \nunions; and E. lgnatov, a Bolshevik official in Moscow, wished to \nsupply the soviets with the right to veto appointments in the trade \nunions. Both baulked at the request of Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra \nKollontai for an equitable division of powers among party, soviets and \ntrade unions. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd. 78 Lenin castigated \nShlyapnikov as an anti-party syndicalist and his ideas as a 'syndicalist \ndeviation' from Bolshevism.79 Lenin ignored the evidence. Shlyapnikov \ndid not want to abolish the Bolshevik party; his platform was not \ndesigned to entrust the working class with untrammeled power. He was \nnot a syndicalist, and Lenin knew it. Yet Lenin, having been patient \nwith his party critics until the Eighth Congress of Soviets in December, \nhad his blood up.80 \nLenin introduced a philosophical dimension to the discussion: \nalways a sign of his irritation. Comical \nas this is as a response to Bukharin's perfectly ordinary and innocent \nturn of speech, it was written in earnest: 'In parenthesis it is \nappropriate to note for the benefit of young party members,' asserted \nLenin, 'that it is impossible to become a conscious, real communist \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwithout studying -\nand truly studying -\neverything written by \nPlekhanov on philosophy since this is the best of the entire \ninternational literature of Marxism.'81 \nTOWARDS THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY \nThe 'trade union discussion' prolonged the diversion of the leadership's \nattention from problems which had begun to be addressed, however \nimperfectly, at the Ninth Party Conference of September 1920. A \nPolitburo decision was taken on 28 January 1921 enjoining Trotski and \nZinoviev, who were on an investigatory mission for the Council of \nLabour and Defence in the Urals, to relegate questions about the trade \nunions to the background. Resentment of Bolshevik political and \neconomic policies within a garrison that had supplied the shock troops \nfor the party in 1917 was reaching boiling point. The peasantry hated the \ncontinuation of the forcible requisitioning of food, the imposition of \nlabour duties and the military conscription of their young men; and \ntheir discontent was clearly focussed on the Bolshevik party and its \ncommissars.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A. Antonov, a local \n Less Politics. \n167 \nleader, put himself at their head and incurred Lenin's wrath as having \nmanipulated the minds of Tambov's peasants. They were determined to \nsecure justice for their cause, and offered a still greater threat to Lenin \nand his associates in 1921 than they had to Kerenski in 1917.89 \nThe Politburo met again on 2 February 1921.92 \nAt first sight it was a bit rich of Lenin to harass Tsyurupa. It is also clear that the striking workers and \nmutineering sailors did not yet unduly bother Lenin and his associates. \nEqually interesting is the lack of Lenin's prominence in the debate.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.97 Since the October Revolution the tendency of \nBolshevik policy had been in the direction of reinforced state \nregulation of the economy. \nBut Lenin had been shaken into re-thinking his own attitudes more \nand more deeply. He had taken detailed notes on grievances expressed \nat a special meeting of non-Bolshevik peasant delegates at the Eighth \nCongress of Soviets on 22 December 1920.98 In addition, he visited \ncertain villages in Moscow province: Yaropolets on 14 November 1920 \nand Modenovo on 15 December 1920. \nPeasants also streamed into the capital seeking an audience with the \nSoviet leader throughout the winter of 1920-1921. Their memoirs were to be written within a political \nenvironment that brooked no criticism of the Bolshevik party and \nSoviet government; and, in any case, the nature of his office was bound \nto deter people from speaking frankly even to a man of Lenin's \nrenowned approachability. 102 The first Bolshevik \nofficial to do so in Lenin's presence was V. 103 \nDid Sokolov finally change Lenin's mind. \nAt a conference of metal-workers on 4 February 1921 Lenin merely \nhinted at the direction of his thought. Four full members were present: Lenin, \nKamenev, Stalin and Krestinski. 107 It was at \nthis meeting that Lenin, having listened to a report by Deputy People's \nCommissar for Agriculture N. \nLenin's draft was scribbled out on a single sheet of paper and handed \nto a working party consisting of Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Osinski. 110 No \nPolitburo resolution was recorded on the proposed change of policy; \nand Lenin, in contrast with his behaviour in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, held back from joining this crucial working party. The intra-party discussions in early 1918 had nearly \nbroken up the party. Already the Bolsheviks were at sixes and sevens \nabout the trade unions; and, at a moment of peasant revolts, Lenin had \nto handle his collapsible party with extreme care. \nPolitburo meetings throughout February decided the personnel and \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \npractical measures needed to crush the resistance to Bolshevik party \npower. A cautious approach was \nmaintained: the participants would be lesser Bolsheviks and not the \nparty's leaders. Several amend-\nments had been made to Lenin's sketch. 119 Neither \nLenin nor anyone else in the Politburo looked on the reform with \nenthusiasm, and no one wanted to incur unpopularity for pushing it \nthrough without the consent of most party leaders. 122 It was a blow for the consensus achieved in the Politburo; \nbut even Lenin, while disagreeing with Tsyurupa, had opposed the re-\nemergence of middlemen who would take grain for sale in other towns. 123 \nNevertheless Lenin might not have reconciled the Party Congress to \nthe tax in kind if popular rebellions had not intensified. It was by no \nmeans universally accepted in the party that a lowered level of state-\nprocured grain would alleviate urban food-supply difficulties; and the \nvehemence of the Bolshevik fraction's reaction to the much milder \nproposal for agrarian reform made by Lenin and Preobrazhenski at the \nEighth Congress of Soviets lingered in the Politburo's memory. Strikes and food \nshortages shook the minds of all Bolsheviks in Moscow. Strikes broke out \nin Petrograd, and an anti-Bolshevik leaflet campaign had been \norganised. 126 \nThis scale of opposition to the party had not existed since spring and \nsummer 1918. The original advocates \nof the tax were denounced by some Bolshevik activists as being \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSocialist Revolutionaries (as indeed Sokolov had once been);128 and \nthe tax was said to involve a re-installation of 'bourgeois relations' in \nthe economy (as in fact it did). 129 From Bolshevik leaders in the \nUkraine, including the entire Ukrainian Central Committee, there had \ncome a protest that a tax in kind would impede the People's \nCommissariat of Food Supplies from extricating any grain whatsoever \nfrom the peasants at a time of an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt across \nthe southern provinces.130 \nBut Lenin held firm.131 Nor did he fait to \nemphasise that the contents of the Ukrainian Bolshevik protest had \nacknowledged that the local working-class population already \ndemanded such a reform so that they could barter with the \npeasantry. This time Lenin took charge, becoming commission \nchairman. But it is equally true that, if Lenin had not headed the \ncampaign for reform, the proposal would probably not have reached \nthe agenda sheet of the Tenth Party Congress. \nLENIN'S COHORT \nThe party remained in a condition of shock at the divergence between \nLenin and Trotski over the trade unions. \n173 \nthe country who grew up thinking that the October Revolution had \nbeen led by an individual called 'Lenintrotski' .135 In 1918, during the \nBrest-Litovsk disrute, Lenin and Trotski had avoided trenchant \nmutual criticisms. The London magazine Punch \ncarried a detailed pen-and-ink sketch of Trotski brawling in an office \nand knocking askew a wall-picture of Lenin. \nLenin and Trotski knew that such a menace was not as acute as it \nappeared. Trotski had been asked by Lenin in the October Revolution \nto become People's Commissar for Internal Affairs. To be sure, he may have been exaggerating concern \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nabout his ethnic origin in order to avoid receiving certain posts.144 \nFurthermore, his readiness to turn the party upside down in pursuit of \nhis preferred policies was demonstrated by the 'trade union discussion'; \nand his behaviour after Lenin's death hardly betokens a person \nreluctant to inherit the position of dominant party leader. \nNevertheless in the winter of 1920-1921, while Lenin enjoyed the \nappearance of good health, Trotski fought him over policy only; there \nwas no attempt to reduce Lenin in importance. \nTrotski was undoubtedly putting a sincere case, and he was right to \nargue that the trade-union question touched on almost every aspect of \nthe party's strategy: state power, economic reconstruction, workers' \nrights, local self-government; but he should also have known that the \naverage party official, tried and tested in the heat of the military \nconflict of 1917-1920, felt that debate was a luxury which was ill-\naffordable by the Bolsheviks. Scarcely a month \npassed when Lenin omitted to make such a comment.145 Lenin wanted the same objective, \nbut omitted to say this directly: the term was repugnant to the Marxist \ntradition. Instead the \ntalk among Bolshevik party officials was that, with his power-base in \nthe Red Army, he might become the Napoleon of the Soviet regime. \nBolsheviks thought much about the precedents in the history of the \nFrench Revolution. Trotski's non-Bolshevik past and his abrasive \ntreatment of the party in 1918-1920 gave grounds for the fear that a \nBonapartist counterrevolution might be undertaken under his leader-\nship.J46 \nLenin meanwhile gained from his evident wish to deflect the party \nfrom a damaging discussion. \n175 \nas if the sole way open to them to prove that they were still Joyal \nBolsheviks was to refer affectionately to 'Vladimir Ilich' . Zinoviev hurried round the \nmajor party organisations on Lenin's behalf, talking stingingly about \nthe People's Commissar for Military Affairs. Those Bolsheviks who \nhad been at the front in the Civil War, he emphasised, had scant \nunderstanding of conditions and possibilities in the rear. Lenin would have certainly have done so if \nhe thought he could have got away with it. 151 This group, forced to \ncome off the fence dividing Lenin and Trotski, scared Lenin in 1921 by \ndeciding initially in favour of Trotski.' 153 Zinoviev's platform, more \nthan Lenin's, conceded that appointmentism was a problem in the \nparty. Lenin revelled in verbal \nambiguity. At a time of strikes and mutinies there could be little \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprospect of prolonging their existence, and Trotski complied. Party organisation after organisation, despite \nTrotski's visits to them in person, came over to Lenin's side. Weeks \nbefore the Tenth Party Congress Lenin had won the 'trade union \ncontroversy' . A cabal of fifteen leading 'Leninists' was addressed by \nhim as the Congress gathered in Moscow. Here Lenin put the case that \nTrotski should be included on their slate for election since he would be \nin a permanent minority in the Central Committee and disabled from \ncausing a split in the party. But Lenin also insisted that the main supporters ofTrotski \nshould be removed; Krestinski, Preobrazhenski, Serebryakov and \nI. Lenin must already have had it in mind to give full \nmembership in the Politburo to Zinoviev in return for his part in \nTrotski's defeat, and discussions were under way to fill the Secretariat \nwith officials who had taken Lenin's line in the winter of 1920-1921.'59 \nIn addition, Lenin planned to call a meeting of all those who agreed \nwith him on the trade unions. Lenin was amused: 'What's this I hear from a died-in-the-wool old \nfactionalist. \nTHE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Tenth Party Congress was opened by Lenin in the morning on 8 \nMarch I 92 I. \nAt the evening session Lenin delivered the long-awaited Central \nCommittee political report. 16s \nLenin's implicit argument was that the peasantry's capacity to \ndestabilise the authorities had been underestimated. Lenin declared that the \nfactional disagreements in the Bolshevik party were an intellectual \nluxury. Lenin described it as a 'petit-bourgeois counter-\nrevolution' more dangerous than the White invasions of Kolchak, \nDenikin and Yudenich. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry. 171 The \nreal drama lay with Lenin's strategical change since the previous \nCongress. Lenin's attitude to the Workers' \nOpposition would only cause further disunity. Osinski, for the Democratic Centralists, \nagreed with Lenin that syndicalism had grown as a force in the \nparty. Nor was Lenin immune from criticism. Sosnovski, a supporter of Trotski in the trade-union contro-\nversy, quipped that Lenin had barely mentioned the workers.176 Back came Yuri Milonov for the \nWorkers' Opposition, claiming that Lenin as Sovnarkom chairman \n Less Politics. It was his contention that the strict line on the trade unions \naccepted by Lenin at the previous Party Congress was responsible for \nstimulating working-class discontent. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin. In Moscow, as he pointed out, 'the arch-democrat Stalin' \nhad been organising Lenin's faction as if an internal party war were \nbeing fought. Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends. When the \ntime arrived for Lenin to respond to his critics, he was ill-disposed to \ncompromise. 180 That evening, \nat session four, Lenin's report was approved by 514 votes against 47 for \nthe Democratic Centralists and 45 for the Workers' Opposition. With the recent conquest of the Transcaucasus in \neveryone's mind, Stalin stressed the party's objective of equal rights for \nall nationalities; and he expatiated a bit on the tendency of several \nRussian Bolsheviks to indulge in 'Russian Great-Power chauvinism'. \nStalin noted that, as a result of discussions at the Eighth Party \n 180 \nLenin: A Political Life \nCongress, the slogan no longer figured in the party programme. 185 \nFurthermore, Lenin in 1921 would indubitably have been annoyed by \nStalin's dismissiveness about national self-determination. The slogan \nremained dear to Lenin. He also \nconfessed that he himself, a Bolshevik leader, failed to understand the \nprecise nature of the treaty between Soviet Russia and Soviet \nUkraine. Still Lenin kept himself out of the \nway. \nLenin played his part again. 195 \nNothing was left to chance, and Lenin on the same day as the last of \nthe emergency sessions penned drafts of his two motions on the \nsyndicalist deviation and on party unity. 196 In the first motion, the \nWorkers' Opposition was condemned for is allegedly anti-Marxist \nideas; in the second, factional activity in general was banned on pain of \nexpulsion from the Central Committee for any faction's leader (and \nfrom the party for the faction as a whole). He emphasised that in February 1920, so far \nfrom being unorthodox as a Bolshevik, he had put forward a version of \neconomic reform not totally dissimilar from the current proposal to \nabolish grain requisitioning; he revealed also that Lenin at the time had \naccused him of 'Free Trade-ism'.200 But Trotski did little to promote \nhis case on the unions beyond asserting that the Central Committee's \nmotion was so lacking in fluency that Lenin could not have scrutinised \nit closely. As \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe went down to the expected defeat, he lamely declared that the trade-\nunion resolution would not survive in effect through to the Eleventh \nParty Congress. All 479 votes were cast to confirm Lenin's membership. Out of \nthe other Politburo members, Stalin came sixth in the Central \nCommittee list, Trotski a humiliating tenth and Zinoviev - who had \nbeen the peripatetic champion of Lenin's line on the trade unions in the \nwinter - an even more distressing eighteenth. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'.206 At present the peasants were \ndiscontented, and Lenin added: 'Classes cannot be tricked.214 \nTwo speakers followed in Lenin's support, including Evgeni \nPreobrazhenski: the Bolshevik Left contained many who saw that \nsome reform was urgently necessary. 215 \nLenin's summary speech at the end was characteristically combative. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'.218 \nLenin had handled the Congress superbly. Lenin was \nvital to the re-orientation of policies.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'.220 And yet even he, the leading figure on the Bolshevik \nRight, took a stern view. Then, in the closing minutes, Lenin quickly \nintroduced the two debates on party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist \ndeviation.", "Bolshevik_Party_1921": " The Bolsheviks declared adherence to the strictest \ncentralism and discipline in successive versions of their rule-book; but \nfactions, organised or semi-organised, continued to exist despite the \nresolution banning them at the Tenth Party Congress. \nNaturally this was not how Bolsheviks critical of Lenin saw matters. Lenin \nsaw things differently, to the point of outright exasperation. ' 1 Thus Lenin refuted the claim that he had \nestablished a dictatorship over the party; but his own words, with their \ncondescending implication that Joffe was overwrought because of an \nexcessive workload, was evidence of a confident dominance bordering \n219 \n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \non arrogance. And the Politburo ruled the country in the interstices of the \nCentral Committee meetings. \nThe other central public institutions were subordinate to the party \napparatus. A Politburo member ran each of them. Lenin chaired \nSovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence; Kamenev the \nMoscow City Soviet and the Moscow City Party Organisation; Trotski \nthe People's Commissariat of Military Affairs; Stalin the People's \nCommissariat of Nationality Affairs and the Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate; and Zinoviev the Executive Committee of the Communist \nInternational and the Petrograd City Party Organisation. Candidate \nmembers of the Politburo also had crucial posts. But just as the People's Commissar of Military Affairs had \nthe right to poke his nose into economic strategy, so Lenin interfered in \ninnumerable corners, large and small, of public life. Like other \nBolshevik leaders, he had heard and ignored critics like the Democratic \nCentralists who said- among other things- that the party ought to re-\norganise its bodies in Moscow in pursuit of greater efficiency. \nLenin treated him brusquely.5 Lenin's letter was really \nan instance of the party's supreme leader driving a subordinate to \nhigher levels of industriousness. But there was also a stated goal of removing \nBolsheviks who had failed to carry out party instructions: this was \nclearly aimed at activists who, despite the ban on factions at the Tenth \nParty Congress, campaigned overtly for their views. Around a quarter of the entire membership of the Russian \nCommunist Party was expelled by the end of the year.9 Yet \nthe mud did not stick to Lenin (in contrast to the way it caked him in \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrelation to his economic retreat of 1921 ). Lenin acknowledged to Stalin that he was \nnot quite au fait with the scale of the Orgburo's activity in re-assigning \nparty officials to jobs across the country. 10 This did not demonstrate \nthat Orgburo member Stalin was bamboozling Lenin. Lenin and Stalin were allies. 11 It was not as if \nLenin himself was uninvolved in assignments of personnel at the very \nhighest level. 12 \nThere is no sign that Lenin was unhappy about the policy on \nassignments pursued by Stalin and Molotov. 13 \nHis distance from the implementation of intra-party discipline \npermitted him to take a paternal attitude to dissentient Bolsheviks. Myasnikov, who inspired several \nactivists who proceeded to form the small anti-Bolshevik socialist \nparties, such as Workers' Truth and Workers' Group, after the Tenth \nParty Congress. Another socialist who had influenced them was none \nother than Lenin's inveterate adversary Aleksandr Bogdanov. 15 Lenin responded \nseverely: 'Why insist on this mistake of yours, this clear mistake, on this \nnon-party, anti-party slogan: \"freedom of the press\". 17 But Lenin was also comradely: 'We'll get \ntogether and we'll work amicably in the same party.' 18 Most \nBolsheviks, however critical they were of Lenin, assumed that in some \nrecess of his mind he meant well. Lenin seemed to many as a one-man \ncourt of appeal when Bolsheviks felt that the party's principles were at \nstake. On \n20 February 1922, the Politburo expelled him from the party. On 14 October 1921 Lenin submitted \na draft instruction to be issued by the Politburo, reaffirming the \nvalidity of the Orgburo's decision about Shlyapnikov.20 \nBehind the scenes Lenin was therefore as firm as the rest of the \nPolitburo in tightening the disciplinary screws.29 \nIn the Politburo there was little enthusiasm for Lenin's suggestion. \nBelow the Politburo, Sovnarkom was the most influential institution in \nthe Soviet state. If Lenin was not going \nto hold the Sovnarkom chairmanship actively, then his immediate \ncolleagues - Kamenev, Stalin, Trotski and Zinoviev - needed time for \ndiscussion and compromise before agreeing as to who should become \nhis temporary deputies.30 It deserves emphasis that they were not (as is \noften supposed in East and West) unreasonable in their reluctance to \naccede to Lenin's proposal. \nA further factor was the wariness of each central Bolshevik leader \nabout his colleagues after the disputes among them in 1920-1921. Lenin the \nanti-factionalist, moreover, was a factionalist himself when his interests \nwere in danger. Lenin's motives could not always be assumed to be of the \npurest type. \nIt is possible that Lenin continued to grind his factional axe even in \nthe winter of 1921-1922. Lenin took \ntrips to Moscow which allowed him to participate in intra-party \ndiscussions. Lashevich and pass on the scheme in \nthe name of Stalin and Lenin. At Lenin's instigation, Trotski had been rebuffed when \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemanding greater emphasis on central state planning, and was \npredictably unwilling to grant automatic sanction to Lenin's proposal \nfor a formal system of deputies in Sovnarkom. \nTHE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERN A TJONAL \nLenin's troubles with non-Bolsheviks were considerably fewer than \nwith the party.36 Just as the Decree on Land in October 1917 had become known \nas 'Lenin's Decree', so the abolition of War Communism was counted \nunto him for virtue. Nor did anti-Bolshevik profes-\nsional cadres employed by the Soviet state withhold admiration even \nthough he was still capable of letting the Cheka loose upon individuals \namong them. While Lenin attentively watched over his Russian \nCommunist party in the changing conditions of 1921, he took his eye \noff his leading comrades in Germany, Italy, Britain and France.38 But a debate could not indefinitely be \npostponed: a questionnaire was issued to fraternal communist parties \nabout the prospects of revolution in the rest of Europe. 39 Quietly Lenin \nhad decided what kind of answer he would accept.40 This was in \nApril 1921. Whereas in \nautumn 1917 Lenin would have had no objection to such thinking, in \n1921 he thought it to be 'the cretinity of the \"leftists\"'.46 \nLenin, burdened by the Soviet domestic political agenda, took three \nmonths after the Tenth Party Congress before inserting himself into the \naffairs of European communism. But Lenin and Trotski did not conspire with each other. At Lenin's insistence, they included a phrase about the need to \nget the support of 'the majority of the working class' before power \nshould be seized.49 Even so, the leaders of the Communist \nParty of Germany felt betrayed by this compromise, and wrote to \nLenin defending their past actions. \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNext day they wrote to the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, still unapologetically describing the Action as a step \nforward for the communist movement. 50 Lenin stated that he was sorry \nfor showing his anger at his meeting with them.53 \nBy then Lenin, Trotski and Kamenev were working closely to thwart \nZinoviev, Bukharin and their supporters in the Communist Interna-\ntional. 54 Several days before the Congress opened in the Bolshoi \nTheatre on 22 June 1921 it was obvious that Kun and Thalheimer had \nlost the struggle, and that Zinoviev's remaining aim was to disguise his \nown incompetence and to pretend that he was near to the subsequently-\nestablished position of Lenin. The Russian Communist \nParty's mastery of the international communist movement was \nconsolidated. To the Congress's surprise, he \nproceeded to justify the open letter written by Paul Levi calling for a \npolitical alliance of all the parties of German socialism in January 1921 \n(even though Lenin still refrained from seeking Levi's re-instatement in \nthe Communist Party of Germany). Lenin \ntold the Congress that the German communists should adopt the \nRussian Bolshevik strategy of 1917. Supposedly the October Revolu-\ntion in Petrograd was attempted only after the party had secured 'the \nmajority of soviets of workers' and peasants' deputies' on its side. The Bolsheviks acquired a neat majority even in \nthe urban soviets only after the Petrograd seizure of power, and \nSocialist Revolutionaries of various types were favoured by most \npeasants.62 In sessions thirteen and fourteen, on 2 July, the overtly \ncomradely ambience among the leaders of the Russian Communist \nParty was destroyed.63 Lenin had missed the proceedings. He \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \npresumably calculated that, as long as his principal aims were not \nchallenged, he should let the other Bolshevik leaders deal with the \nproblems; his health, too, was bothering him.64 But Lenin declined their request.67 This came in session seventeen on 5 July with \nthe debate on 'The Tactics of the Russian Communist Party'. \nBolsheviks had heard it all before. Lenin spoke for \none hour and ten minutes.69 But his was an organisation which had split from the official \nCommunist Party of Germany. In August 1917 I too was an \nemigre and made too \"leftist\" a proposal to the Central Committee \nwhich fortunately was utterly rejected. Lenin repeated that lessons had to be learned \nfrom Bolshevik history. 73 \nLenin and his Bolshevik associates, having dominated the Congress, \nhad an incentive to give the impression that the Communist \nInternational provided its member parties with equal rights.75 Lenin could tolerate the \ncomplaint. \nTHE ARTS, SCIENCES AND SCHOLARSHIP UNDER LENIN \nThe changes in Bolshevik foreign policy, now ratified by the \nCommunist International, preceded the agrarian reform discussed \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom February 1921 and embodied in law in April. Measures to \nsupervise the country's arts had begun with the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in Petrograd.76 Not only active \npoliticians but also novelists and poets with strongly anti-Bolshevik \nopinions were put on guard that Sovnarkom would retaliate against \nstrong criticism by barring their access to printing facilities. \nLenin's pre-occupations were understandably with the Whites, the \nforeign interventionist forces, the party, food supplies to the cities, the \nComintern.79 The choice of subjects can hardly have been Lenin's.87 \nLunacharski, with Lenin's contented acquiescence, was empowered \nto instigate and co-ordinate artistic policy. Lenin dimly perceived this.'89 \n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis was a common party aspiration.90 Lenin followed their line. had been used by \nLenin as the title of his own 1902 pamphlet on party organisation.92 But it was words \non the printed page that evoked the supreme enthusiasms of the \nBolshevik leader.96 Otherwise \nLenin found him and the self-styled 'Futurists' uncongenial.97 Similarly permission for Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nwho continued to write on social and political theory, to publish and \nlecture was within the gift of the Politburo: Lenin kept his ex-Bolshevik \nadversary on a tight rein.98 \nCensorship held no horrors for Lenin. \n Against the Wall \n235 \nThis was not said openly by him or any other Bolshevik leader. They came in two articles: 'Lev Tolstoi as the Mirror of the \nRussian Revolution' and 'Party Organisation and Party Literature'. Thus the Russian peasantry was anarchistic, obscurantist \nand backward-looking while also reaching forward to new forms of \nsociety. Lenin was no better and no worse than nearly \nall his comrades in boiling down works of art to their contribution to \npolitics. \nIndeed, writing 'Party Organisation and Party Literature' in 1905, \nLenin had called for party-mindedness to be embodied in works of art: \n'What does this principle of party literature consist of.' 100 \nNaturally we have to remember that Lenin wrote these words about \na party which did not yet have power and, furthermore, a party which \nhad exiguous finances and limited access to printing facilities. Lenin's \npurpose at the time was to advise how to organise the party's \nnewspapers (and to commission and control literary contributions to \nthem) while being under threat from the Romanov monarchy. The boundary between what was pro-party and what \n 236 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwas anti-party was definable by reference to the party programme. Lenin added: 'Freedom of \nspeech and press must be complete. Coming from \nLenin, however, it was freighted with menace for freedom of the arts \nunder socialism. \nDespite acquiring a posthumous reputation as the founder of Soviet \nartistic policy, he was not at the centre of discussions when the \nBolshevik central leadership at last confronted the problem that the \nparty had not acquired a phalanx of party litterateurs. Zinoviev presented the leadership's conclu-\nsions to the Twelfth Party Conference in August 1922 (while Lenin was \nrecuperating from a stroke). \nThe resultant resolution conceded that Bolsheviks, since they did not \nhave many litterateurs, would have to find tolerable allies among \nliterary groups which at least did not oppose them. 110 It was a great pity, for the \nfate of Soviet literature in the 1930s, that he was too ill to re-affirm \nsuch a commitment in 1922. The foreign policy \nof Soviet Russia was held tightly in Lenin's grasp. Unlike other \nholders of important jobs in Soviet politics, consequently, he needed \npatronage in order to make his way. \nInternational relations were highly contentious among leading \nBolsheviks; but Lenin and Chicherin agreed on most matters and \npriorities. Like a traditional foreign \nminister bargaining on behalf of a weak state, Lenin wanted to \nmanoeuvre between various capitalist powers; he wanted to play them \nofT against each other. If capitalist countries, \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindividually or collectively, wanted to deal with the Bolsheviks on this \nbasis, well and good. If not, the Bolsheviks could and should bide their \ntime. Karl Radek, presumably \nwith Lenin's knowledge, published an article in Pravda on 4 December \n1921 urging German politicians and businessmen to recognise their \nopportunities in Soviet Russia. A conference would be held in Genoa and the \nBolsheviks would be invited to attend. Lenin became even \nmore pessimistic about the proposed international conference. 118 But Lenin \nthought himself indispensable to the Revolution, and on 12 January \nwrote to the Politburo declaring that not only he but also Trotski and \nZinoviev should be prohibited from travelling abroad at all. Everyone wanted to see what \nLenin looked like. Appetites \nhad been whetted by lurid reportage, and the prospect of the Soviet \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \nleader's appearing in the streets and on newsreels had been attractive. But Lenin was immovable. 120 \nThe technical preparations continued to worry Lenin. 124 Lenin's \ntoughly anti-British and pro-German orientation was now fixed in his \nmind. 126 Lenin \ncontinued to harass the People's Commissariat of External Affairs. 127 Lenin was having none of it. Lenin successfully \nrecommended that the Soviet delegation should make its proposals in a \n'bourgeois-pacifist' spirit. Now he \nresolutely opposed Lenin's attempt to play on what both of them \nregarded as pacifist illusions. 129 But Lenin insisted, reassuring \nChicherin that the party leadership's commitment to communism \nand non-pacifism was undiminished. 130 On 16 February, Lenin \nrepeated to Chicherin that the Soviet delegates should not panic. Lenin's recklessness \nalarmed him. Lenin persuaded the \nPolitburo that a telegram be sent instructing Chicherin to correct this \nderogation from official party policy. The 'Russians' and \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Germans renounced all claims against each other about war losses \nand damage as well as about nationalised property. 139 \nAt the same session Lenin accused the Soviet delegation of having \nbeen too soft in negotiations.140 But \nLenin would not let the matter drop. 141 Lenin was undeterred.' 43 But there the matter rested, and \nLenin calmed down and started to enjoy his achievements of the past \nmonths. This did not mean that a law-based order was the \nparty's objective; on the contrary, the Bolsheviks remained legal \nnihilists - and Lenin in this respect was their principal theorist. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. Lenin stipulated that the Bolsheviks should \nreserve the option of terrorist methods. 147 By 1 December \n1921, Lenin had been won over, and he helped draft a Politburo minute \nfor the narrowing of the Cheka's powers of arrest and for the \nreinforcement of the revolutionary tribunals as the source of judgement \nand sentencing. Incommoded \nby ill-health, Lenin left the business to his associates. Lenin made plain, in a \nletter to the veteran Cheka leader Unszlicht, that the reform's effects \nwere to be restricted. In other words, the Cheka's \nabolition would be a cosmetic operation; and Lenin required an \nincrease in the 'speed and force of the repressions' by the Cheka \nofficers. 152 \nUnszlicht, who became the deputy chairman of the Main Political \nAdministration, was encouraged by Lenin to use him as an \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermediary in the Politburo on behalf of repressive agencies. 153 Lenin \nstressed that the Bolsheviks refused to 'recognise courts that were \nabove classes'. Lenin, ex-lawyer from the Volga, \nwas unfussed by legal niceties; be called for the Civil Code to have a \npropagandistic passage linking such activities to 'the international \nbourgeoisie and its struggle against us' . Lenin's apparent humanitarianism was displayed \nonly fitfully.' 59 \nLenin worried especially about the anti-Bolshevik parties. On 27 March 1922 he answered criticism \nby the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with the threat: \n'Kindly let us stand you against the wall for this1'163 An international \nmeeting of socialists was taking place in Berlin with Bolshevik \nparticipation.164 Lenin \nwas angered. The repression of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, according to Lenin, was \nonly half of the business. He wanted the \nSoviet press to conduct a campaign linking anti-Bolshevik socialists in \nRussia with 'the international bourgeoisie' . Popular opinion needed to be rallied to the Bolsheviks. Not \nconfining this repression to politics, Lenin aimed to retaliate against \nhostile opinion in culture. The Politburo accompanied its day-to-day \ngeneral control over the arts, science and scholarship169 with a sharp \nexemplary campaign of violence. Lenin wrote a memo to his personal \nassistant N.' 173 There was nothing \nin fact openly hostile to the Soviet government. The insulation of Soviet readers from thinkers who might \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndeflect them from Bolshevism was an explicit aim. On 19 March 1922 Lenin wrote to the Politburo that the \necclesiastical authorities in the town of Shuya had organised a \ndemonstration against the government's decree on the compulsory \nsale abroad of ecclesiastical treasures to raise funds to relieve the \nfamine by the Volga. Patriarch Tikhon should not be touched for fear of \nprovoking demonstrations against the Bolsheviks.' 177 \nThe Politburo met next day in Lenin's absence through illness. 180 \nLenin, who was known for melding ideological inclination with \nRealpolitik, had for the moment lost his touch. Lenin's reaction was ecstatic: 'True. The question whether to subject the Mensheviks to the same \ntreatment had been discussed again in the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee. 186 But the focus was retained on the Socialist Revolution-\naries. It had been fear of the peasants that had induced Lenin to \nintroduce the New Economic Policy, and it was logical for him to \nterrorise the party which was most popular among them. The charge \nsheet sought to implicate their Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee, not excluding those such as Viktor Chernov who was \nthen in emigration, with direct responsibility for the attempt on Lenin's \nlife in August 1918, for political and military support for the White \narmies and for post-war links with the Allied governments. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was \nindeed involved in the episode at the former Mikhelson factory, and \nmany of its members fought for Komuch against the Reds. The claim was outrageous that, from start to \nfinish, the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee had participated \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nactively in the counsels of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. Socialist \nRevolutionaries in a large number joined the Reds in the Civil War, \nand the Bolsheviks had recognised this by the amnesty granted to them \nin 1919. Little pretence at impartiality was made; the chairman of \nproceedings was Yuri Pyatakov, Bolshevik Central Committee \nmember. Speeches on the iniquity of the Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership were made by supposedly soft-hearted Bolsheviks such as \nNikolai Bukharin and Anatoli Lunacharski. Trotski was annoyed, arguing that lives should \nbe spared only if the defendants forswore hostile activity against the \nBolshevik party and the Soviet government. Great courage had been displayed \nthroughout the trial by most of the accused, and they were as unlikely \nto abase themselves before the Bolsheviks as the Bolsheviks would have \nbowed the knee to Aleksandr Kerenski. The Bolshevik party had shown its teeth \nand cowed its enemies. Lenin considered it vital that a united front \nshould be formed by the Central Committee, and had exerted himself \n Against the Wall \n249 \nto this end despite ill-health as preparations were made for the opening \nof the Eleventh Party Congress in Moscow on 27 March 1922. The row had continued through the winter of 1921-1922, \nand Preobrazhenski wished to have the topic debated at the Party \nCongress194 Lenin needed to stop this at all costs; for Preobrazhenski, \narguing before a Bolshevik party audience about the bias of such \nmeasures in favour of the kulak, might well meet with a favourable \nresponse. 196 \nThe tranquillising of the Congress was also ensured by Lenin's \nwillingness to deliver the Central Committee political report. One of its \nmembers, Emelyan Yaroslavski, proposed that each Department of the \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSecretariat should be headed by a Central Committee member.202 \nLenin returned to the lectern to deliver the Central Committee's \npolitical report. \nBolsheviks needed to learn how to facilitate a resurgence of trade. \nThey had acted impermissibly in appealing above the head of the \nRussian Communist Party to the other communist parties. Towards the Mensheviks and other non-\nBolshevik parties he was much less restrained. Lenin emphasised that the party already had \nsufficient political and economic power in its hands. The Bolsheviks, constituting a small \npercentage of the population, were dependent on a large and \n Against the Wall \n251 \nideologically alien state bureaucracy. Mykola \nSkrypnik acclaimed Lenin's reference to the Ukraine's status as an \nindependent republic. His recommendation for the fonnation of an Econburo \nto accompany the Politburo, as Lenin commented, would not have \nbeen easy to demarcate. \nNext day, at session three, Lenin was attacked by Workers' \nOpposition leader Aleksandr Shlyapnikov (who nevertheless referred \n 252 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto him as Vladimir Ilich). There were also criticisms of Lenin which were non-\nfactional in origin. Dmitri Manuilski, a Bolshevik leader in Kiev, \nobjected to his talking of Ukraine as an independent republic. Lenin's \nwill to maintain the public fiction of several independent republics \nattracted the Skrypniks and repelled the Manuilskis, and laid a basis \nfor a roaring controversy later in 1922.218 Manuilski claimed to have put Lenin right in private \nconversation. Trotski rallied \nto Lenin.219 \nLenin was pleased that no one bad called for the New Economic \nPolicy's abandonment; and, in mock self-disdain, he turned to critics \nsuch as Yuri Larin and noted that the 'terroristic power' that had \nvanquished the world's armies and installed a dictatorship of the \nproletariat had yet to win victory over 'Larin's army': 'Here we have a \ntotal defeat. They offered the chance for Trotski and Lenin to bury their \ndifferences. As in the Civil War, they agreed about most aspects of \nBolshevik party policy. The Congress delegates, \nlike Lenin, desired to avoid serious upset.230 \n'Speculation' was a dirty word in the Bolshevik lexicon. Sokolnikov, he declared, had deprived \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvital state industries of investment. The Bolshevik \n'leftists', as they were soon to be described, were a bomb waiting to \nexplode. Moreover, he was reluctant to make too bold a \nrupture with his Politburo colleagues at a time of Lenin's illness.' Such sententiousness was used to justify the closure of \nfurther recruitment to the party on the grounds that far too many \ncareerists and non-Bolshevik socialists had infiltrated the ranks. Lenin was unhappy with the change of plan and moved to \nprevent any full-scale attack on the party's agrarian reforms. 236 \nUkrainian Bolshevik leader V. Not for the last time, a leading \nUkrainian Bolshevik sought a hardening of the official line on \nagriculture.237 Osinski personalised his retort: 'Comrade Lenin clearly \ntried to fix this in place, and comrade Chubar is coming out precisely \nagainst it.239 Lenin closed the proceeding with a brief address.", "Bolshevik_Party_1922": " Prominent Bolsheviks were not \nunusual in trying to hide away the altercations among themselves. Most \npeople knew next to nothing about the Bolshevik wrangling about the \nNew Economic Policy; and the rumours about dissension in the party, \nwhich had came to the ears of those observers with friends in the \nparty's higher echelons, were dying down. And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. There were rows about foreign trade, about state \nbureaucracy, about the Soviet constitution, about party administration \nand even about the division of responsibilities among these same \ncolleagues. \nBolshevik leaders, including Lenin, were irked that a retreat from \nsupposedly socialist policies had been forced upon them. Not only Lenin and Trotski but also the rest \nof the Politburo peppered their public statements with references to the \nFrench Revolution and its eventual retreat from ideological radicalism. \nThe possibility that the New Economic Policy might initiate a counter-\nrevolution from within was in their thoughts and was sustained by the \nstridency of attacks made by non-Bolshevik Russians in emigration \nwho predicted this very denouement. \nLenin's illness reduced the chances for differences of opinion \nremaining amicable in the Politburo.7 \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe central party leaders surveyed these developments carefully, \ndeciding to make no public announcement. By then the Politburo \nwas facing difficulty in explaining Lenin's protracted absence from \nMoscow.10 \nLenin had always been attentive about his health.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. On that occasion Lenin had tried to \nmake little of his difficulty: 'My leg's tired, I've got pins and needles.'16 \nThese were to be hints for Osipov that Lenin had almost certainly \nsuffered a series of mild strokes.21 \nThe sole full member of the Politburo to approve Lenin's scheme was \nKamenev.22 Lenin irritatedly replied on 5 May, defending Rabkrin and \nrejecting Trotski's demands about the State Planning Commission. \nTrotski and Lenin argued as if it could be taken for granted that \nLenin would shortly return to his political jobs. The scheme proposed \nby him was carefully limited to the matter of his Sovnarkom deputies \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand their functions. The Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic's most \nreluctant f. 7 \nLenin, his bossy exuberance and his eye for detail restored to him, \nplanned to re-enter political activity and its intensity. Another hypothesis was that Lenin was suffering merely \nfrom massive over-work.30 \nThere was another potential diagnosis which the Politburo withheld \nfrom public deliberations: namely that Lenin had syphilis. As yet we cannot say beyond peradventure \nthat Lenin was not suffering from it.37 This perfectly characterised Lenin's circumstances. \nYet Lenin simply could not understand a life outside politics.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke. Valentinov also noted that, in the pre-revolutionary \nyears, it was usually a crisis in politics which precipitated the elation or \nthe depression in Lenin. \nSeveral leading Bolsheviks began to argue that the business of \nimports and exports therefore be partially denationalised.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation.45 \nBy early March 1922 he had appeared to have won;46 but already on \n15 May he was worried enough to write to Stalin as General Secretary \nof the Central Committee requesting the Politburo's approval for a \ndirective confirming the monopoly. The \nPolitburo accepted Lenin's request on 22 May - only three days \nbefore his major stroke.49 Lenin's summer \nconvalescence gave the proponents of denationalisation their chance. 5\u00b0 If Lenin and Trotski \nhad trusted each other better, things might have been different. Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski. After \nconsulting the other members, he announced the postponement \nrequested by Lenin.s9 \nActive supporters of Lenin in the party leadership's front rank were \nfew. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. The severe aches and pains returned on 25 November, and \nLenin was incapacitated. Mariya Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] said not to \nbother him with anything- and that, if he himself enquires after the \nanswers, to ask whomever is appropriate.'67 The doctors this time were successful in their \ninsistence: Lenin was to stop work absolutely for a whole week.70 Lenin was a tough old bird and in \nfact kept on working; but on 13 December, at eleven o'clock in the \nmorning, his doctors advised that he would be seriously at risk if his \ndisobedience continued.71 Lenin obeyed, but \nonly after arranging contingency measures for the Central Committee \nplenum. By midday on 12 \nDecember Lenin had made up his mind to ask Trotski for support. \nLenin had turned the tables on them.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership. \nTrotski had been highly suspect to Lenin since the 'trade union \ncontroversy', and Stalin had been among Lenin's most valuable \nsupporters in limiting the influence of the party's left wing.81 \nLenin's health problems in the winter of 1921-1922 had pushed him \ncloser and closer to Stalin.82 \nLenin needed a new Sverdlov, and he thought Stalin would fit the bill \ndespite the unsettled relations between them in the past. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress.86 In any case, bad blood had not come \nbetween Lenin and Stalin; as yet their disputes had been kept within the \nbounds of a party which thrived on polemics. Just such a colleague - a colleague who had \nappeared to concur with Lenin on most fundamental current issues -\nwas to Lenin's liking as he himself made arrangements for his \nconvalescence. He was already a Politburo member (whereas \n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMolotov had only even become a candidate member when selected as \n'responsible secretary').89 \nThere was also concern lest Stalin's multiple tenure of posts in party \nand government should impede his ability to handle any one of them.90 At \nthe plenum of the Central Committee it was Lenin who intervened to \nput minds at rest.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time.94 Lenin on this occasion was \nignored by his colleagues. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. He wished to allay any suspicion \nharboured by Lenin that the Politburo was doing things which, if he \nhad been fit, would have incurred Lenin's displeasure. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin.99 Lenin put Stalin at his ease. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. Why had Lenin chosen his political colleague for this \nmission. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. Lenin and Martov had belonged to \nthe same St Petersburg Marxist organisation in the 1890s; they had \nfounded the newspaper Iskra together in the emigration in 1900. \nSubsequently they had fallen out: Lenin the Bolshevik struggled \nagainst Martov the Menshevik. \nRevealing what had passed between him and Lenin, he asked them \nwhat he should do. Lenin perked up a little at this and asked: 'Are you up to some \ncunning.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. \nLenin's overt friendliness to Stalin was anyway predicated upon \nneed. Their past disagreements had once provoked \nTrotski to shout at Lenin that he was a 'hooligan' at a Politburo \nmeeting. 112 This self-restraint \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmight now pay dividends. The October Revolution and the \nCivil War had brought them together, and Lenin was inviting Trotski \nto resume close collaboration. A \nCongress of Soviets was due to be held in late December, and its \nproceedings were expected to define the relations between Russia and \nthe other Bolshevik-led republics of the former Russian empire. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. \nLenin still desired a multi-republican federation wherein the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic was a constituent republic alongside \nthe other Soviet republics; Stalin continued to call for the other Soviet \nrepublics simply to be pulled into the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet \nRepublic with rights of regional autonomy. Tensions \nbetween Moscow and the non-Russian republics increased in 1921-\n1922, with Ukraine and Georgia being especially annoyed by the \nprovisions of the treaties they had signed with the RSFSR. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. The Georgian Bolsheviks \nstrenuously objected to Stalin's proposal that the Georgian republic \nshould be incorporated in a Transcaucasian Federation (which in turn \nwould enter the RSFSR). Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 117 A \nregional federal authority should be able to forestall inter-republican \nstrife; and, much as the Georgian Bolshevik leaders felt done down by \nthis, they had not always shown attitudes typical of socialist \ninternationalism. The Georgian Bolsheviks had even \nwished to introduce a law on citizenship which would discriminate \nheavily against the several non-Georgian minorities in the republic. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. 119 \nWhere the Georgian Bolsheviks failed, however, the party leadership \nin Ukraine had some success. 120 A week later the Politburo \nestablished a commission to investigate the issues; its chairman was to \n 276 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbe Frunze. On 16 May, they voted to bypass Moscow and contact all \nthe other republics about relations with the RSFSR. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. The trouble caused \nby Frunze and his associates happened barely a week before Lenin's \nstroke. Lenin's guard was lowered by a \nnumber of factors. There is no sign that Stalin's 'autonomisation' \nproject was discussed by Lenin and Stalin at the Gorki sanatorium in \nthe summer. The result was that, despite their vehement disagreement \nin 1920, Lenin remained confident that Stalin would yield to him: only \ngradually did he conclude that the General Secretary was not only \nintransigent but even devious on the matter. \nAfter the Russo-Ukrainian flurry and Lenin's stroke the question \nwas again pushed into the background. Only on 10 August, weeks \nbefore Lenin returned to work in the Kremlin, did the Politburo \ninstruct the Orgburo to 'prepare the question of the interrelationships \nbetween the RSFSR and the independent republics'. 125 \nThe Orgburo met on II August and set up a commission consisting \nof a representative from each of the republics as well as the following \ncentrally-based leaders: Stalin, V. In addition, all matters of finance, trade, industry, \nsecurity, transport, communications, food supplies and military \norganisation would be handled directly by the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic; and no national appellation other than the \nword 'Russian' was to appear in the union's title. 129 \nThe decks were cleared for a struggle between Lenin and Stalin; and \nStalin, quite apart from having the advantage of being fit and active, \nfelt that he had reason on his side and that the party would support \nhim. The memory of Lenin's difficulties on the 'national question' in \n1917-1919,130 when Stalin had been mainly on his side, reinforced \nStalin's intuition that Lenin would lose this time. 133 The Armenian Central Committee took \nthe same line five days later; and on 16 September the party's \nTranscaucasian Regional Committee confirmed this on behalf of \nBolsheviks in Armenia, Azerbaidzhan and Georgia. 134 But things were \nalready unravelling for Stalin. 136 \nEven the Armenian party was less than ecstatic about Stalin's \nproposals, asking that the republics should explicitly be accorded \n'broad autonomy' within the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic \nand that time should be set aside to prepare the population for what \nwas to happen. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'. 139 \nThere was a tacit reluctance among local Bolsheviks to accept the \nstatus of mere 'autonomous republics' for their territories. They did not \nwant to ape the model of the Bashkir Republic within the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. \nPetrovski from the Ukraine was similarly unhappy, and Armenia's \nrepresentative Lukashin was disconcerted by Stalin's brusqueness \nabout the rights of the republics in the future federal order. 143 It was at \nthis point that Lenin came back into the reckoning. The new federation was to be called \nthe Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia and not the Russian \n Testament to a Revolution \n279 \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. Indeed the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic would join it as one of the several constituent \nrepublics, and a set of new supreme organs of power would need to be \nestablished. He and his supporters in the \ncommission wrote to Central Committee recommending the formation \nof a Union as demanded by Lenin - and they proposed the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics as the title. Equally disruptive \nwas Stalin's letter to the Politburo on 27 September objecting to the \nestablishment of separate legislative organs for the Union of Soviet \nRepublics and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic: a clear \nattempt to re-introduce his old project by the back door. 147 \nIf Stalin underestimated Lenin's determination, others did not. Lenin would see to that. Taken slightly aback, \nStalin scribbled: 'I don't know.'149 \nLenin had got his tail up.'150 By this he meant not \nonly Russians in his party who overlooked the wishes of the non-\nRussians in the general population but also non-Russian Bolsheviks \nwho were similarly insensitive. Lenin was well enough \nto attend, but had to withdraw at midday because of toothache. \nThe members included Stalin, Kamenev, Pyatakov, Rykov, Chicherin \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Kalinin as well as representatives from each of the non-Russian \nrepublics. 154 \nStalin in any case saw that Lenin was not properly recovered. When \nLenin returned to chair Sovnarkom on 3 October, an agreement held \namong its members to avoid controversy lest he become agitated. (In \nfact he became a lot more agitated because of this plot of gentility \nagainst himl)155 Stalin also knew that the Georgian Bolshevik leaders' \nhostility to being included in a Transcaucasian federation still cut no \nice with Lenin. 157 At a meeting of the Transcaucasian \nRegional Committee of the Bolshevik party, Ordzhonikidze referred to \nthem as 'chauvinistic filth' .158 The Mdivani group's complaint reached \nLenin's ears, but he replied that he was amazed at the improper tone of \ntheir criticisms of Ordzhonikidze. \nOrdzhonikidze delightedly complied, referring to the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition as a 'Menshevik deviation' . 162 A new Georgian Central Commmittee was \nappointed from Moscow on 24 October. 163 In vain did the resigners \nwrite to Lenin protesting the justice of their cause. And Stalin showed his guile by acceding to the demand of the \nGeorgian Bolshevik dissenters for an investigative mission to be sent to \nTbilisi. The dissentient Georgian Bolsheviks nervously \nawaited their fate. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests. 169 \nLenin in Moscow was beginning anyway to see the need to keep an \neye on Stalin.171 Lenin asked to see Dzierzynski and Rykov, immediately after \ntheir return, in Moscow on 12 December.172 Lenin was appalled.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. 177 This was ratified at a Congress of Soviets of the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. Fittingly it was Stalin who presented \nit for approval to the First AU-Union Congress of Soviets on 30 \nDecember l 922. The Georgian Bolsheviks had \nbeen defeated. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. The Bolshevik \nparty leadership had been casual in drafting legislation; they were \nactivists and wanted action, not fine laws which could never be broken. \nThey were also collectivists and, although no one doubted that Lenin \nhad enjoyed a predominant political position, he had no formal title to \nthis effect within the party. \nThe only leader who could broach the question was Vladimir Ilich \nLenin himself, and it was typical of his tough-mindedness that he \ndetermined to do so. His main worry was the \ndurability of the party's rule over society in a world of states hostile to \nthe Soviet republic. Trotski was the renowned co-instigator \nof the October Revolution, Zinoviev headed the Executive Committee \nof the Communist International and Kamenev was chairman of the \nMoscow Soviet. 182 Lenin's perspicaciousness was dipping here. \nRykov and Tsyurupa, who had figured in his planning for the re-\norganisation of the governmental machinery, were rightly excluded \nfrom the list even though they were prominent politicians with much \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncurrent power. Few \nBolsheviks outside the Politburo membership would have judged him \nto be any more worthy of inclusion than Pyatakov. Stalin, moreover, was thought to lack \ncompetence as a theorist - a major failing in a Bolshevik leader of that \nepoch. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. A party split, he asserted, was the greatest threat to the \nsurvival of the Soviet republic. 183 \nNone of the six colleagues came out well from Lenin's comments. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). \nLenin did not claim that the plan was a panacea. This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. \nIn late December, too, Lenin asked Krupskaya to confide the message \nto Trotski that his feelings towards him since Trotski had escaped from \nSiberia to London in 1902 had not changed and would not change \n'until death itselr. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin. And his avoidance of the analysis of character was \naccompanied by an inclination to trace the potential for a party split \nto general factors of the environment of politics after the October 1917.' 189 \nThis cumbersome remark was meant to indicate that Trotski and \nStalin might eventually find themselves on opposing sides in a dispute \nabout the rival claims on the party's favour on behalf of the working \nclass and the peasants.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. The alienation of most workers from \nthe party was already a commonplace of Bolshevik thought, and nearly \nall peasants were either too exhausted or too ignorant to take the \nSoviet regime seriously. Lenin's bipartite summary of the party's \ndependence on the two classes, furthermore, omitted to mention its \nreliance on the sprawling administrative stratum in order to maintain \nits own 'stability'. Be that as it may, what is striking about Lenin's \njudgement is his correct perception that a party split could occur even if \na policy dispute about the working class and the peasantry did not \ndivide Trotski and Stalin. Evidently Lenin aimed to have an independent source of \ninformation: yet another sign that he took nothing and no one, not \neven his new ally Trotski, for granted. The plenum resolved to remove \nLenin from all connection with active politics for the duration of his \nillness, and devolved upon Stalin an 'individual responsibility for \nVladimir Ilich's isolation as regards both personal relations with \nofficials [of the party: R. Lenin reeked nought of this. 198 But Stalin was mightily \ndispleased in himself and, on 22 December, picked up the phone to \nKrupskaya. '201 Krupskaya kept the incident secret from Lenin, \nhowever, on the grounds that he might be upset. \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThat Stalin could have lost his own self-control to the extent of bad-\nmouthing his leader's wife and comrade is remarkable. It may be that, \nas was rumoured about him not long afterwards, he had already \nconcluded that Lenin's life was fast drawing to its close and that he had \nnothing to lose. Perhaps he judged that 'Lenin is kaput' . \nThe struggle over foreign-trade policy continued to exercise the minds \nof the Bolshevik leaders. Lenin was still a dangerous and important \npiece on the chess-board. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.204 Such a coalition, even with Lenin \non his sickbed and operating at a small fraction of his normal capacity, \nwas a threat to Stalin's continuing advance on power. This did not mention Stalin by name; but it \ncounselled structural change in the central party organs as well as \nrecommending that Trotski's ideas on economic planning should be \nwelcomed by the party.205 Lenin evidently was intent on some political \nreform, and no one had more to lose from this than Stalin.215 It was Volodicheva \nwho took down the six thumbnail sketches of Bolshevik leaders. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session. All three were friends, and Lenin must surely have trusted \nthem implicitly.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command. \nThey had already run to Stalin, already lied to Lenin, already shown \nthey knew what was at stake. In their later lives they were wiJiing \npolitical handmaidens unto Stalin; and there is definite evidence that at \nleast Glyasser took an anti-Trotski position in the controversies of \n1923.218 \nNothing can yet be proved, but it would not be totally surprising if \nthese young women, squeezed in a vice of contrary loyalties and \nsensing that Lenin would not last much longer, continued to yield \ninformation to Stalin.", "Bolshevik_Party_1918": " 3 Only One Year \nTHE PARTY-STATE \nLenin founded a state on principles different from any which had \nexisted. Nor had any of them been dominated, as \nwas Soviet Russia, by a single mass political party. The Bolsheviks \nwere awesome pioneers in this respect as in many others. On coming to govern in October 1917, \nthey had expected to squeeze power in the party's fist. The penetration \nof the old 'bourgeois' state by revolutionary means was a declared goal, \nand the Bolshevik party was determined to direct the process. The assumption was that \nworkers, soldiers and peasants would greet the October Revolution by \nparticipating actively in soviets and other sectional organisations. The \nBolshevik party would send its representatives to serve and lead these \norganisations. A departure of men and women from party committees \ninto jobs in the soviets had begun before the seizure of power on 25 \nOctober 1917; afterwards it turned into a mass exodus. The soviets had \nto be staffed quickly with the party's best cadres. Thus Lenin headed \nSovnarkom, and local Bolshevik leaders moved effortlessly into the \nchairmanship of their regional, provincial and urban soviets. 1 \nThis did not bother leading Bolsheviks so long as the Revolution's \ntriumphal advance continued and the party's representatives behaved \n58 \n Only One Year \n59 \nharmoniously. \nAlready in January and February, the Brest-Litovsk dispute had \nshaken the complacency of Lenin and his colleagues.3 But it was a straw fluttering in the wind which became \na hurricane when the Soviet regime's resources were thrust on to a war \nfooting after the Czechoslovak Legion's revolt in midsummer 1918. The emergent Soviet state was very ramshackle. \nOld public bodies were retained and headed by Bolsheviks. No one, least of all Lenin, gave \na second thought to demarcating the functions of all the institutions. In 1918, Lenin and his Sovnarkom colleagues \nwere dispatching plenipotentiaries to bring order to food supplies or to \ntransport. Lenin wrote as chairman of Sovnarkom, Sverdlov as \nsecretary of the Party Central Committee or frequently as chairman of \nthe Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of \nSoviets. Trotski was the sole \nBolshevik leader with comparable influence in the latter months of \n1918. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. \nHe had said as much at the Seventh Party Congress in March 1918. 11 If Lenin with What is to be Done. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917. There was also a reduction in Moscow. It was all \nvery well for Lenin to be complacent. Local Bolshevik leaders were run ragged by both their \nincreasing duties and the loss of administrators to the Red Army. \nLazar Kaganovich in Nizhni Novgorod and middle-ranking Bolsheviks \nsuch as N. \nLenin did not declare what changed his own mind in this direction. 1s \nThis dismissiveness of the matter at hand was no longer possible \nafter Lenin had heard from Stalin and Dzierzysnki. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans. \nLenin had been involved in particular decisions; and some of them, \nsuch as those relating to the Ukrainian Communist Party, had large \nimplications for Bolshevism throughout the old Russian empire. But husband Yakov saw no urgent need for \nreform; and Lenin apparently concluded that, ifSverdlov felt that way, \nthen things must be all right. Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov. The choice of the three members confirmed Lenin's \nwillingness to leave such administration to others: Yakov Sverdlov, \nM.23 The Orgburo quickly \nbecame a fixture in the central party apparatus. As things turned out, the \nCentral Committee met more often in the first months of 1919 than in \nprevious months; but this was not an unqualified bonus for Lenin. \nStalin had been appointed as food-supplies commissar in southern \nRussia in mid-1918. This is what I'm pushed to do by the interests of the \ncause, and of course the absence of a piece of paper from Trotski won't \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstop me. 'I categorically insist,' he telegrammed to Sverdlov and \nLenin, 'on Stalin's recalt.'33 \nIt was Lenin's convalescence after the attempt on his life that \nbrought Sverdlov into such matters, and Trotski began sending top \ncopies of correspondence to Sverdlov rather than to Lenin.34 Lenin \nwould normally have hated such a loss of personal control, but he was \nreconciled to this temporary condition by Sverdlov's obvious loyalty. On 25 October the Central Committee convened under \nSverdlov's chairmanship- in the presence of Lenin- to discuss Stalin's \n Only One Year \n65 \nclaim that there had been sabotage of supplies on the Southern front \nand that front commander Sytin should be put on trial. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. Avanesov, an associate of Stalin. Okulov fell out with \nVoroshilov in December, and this time Lenin came down on the side of \nTrotski.41 \nThe thing was that Lenin appreciated the advantage of not \nidentifying himself too closely with either Trotski or Stalin. But Lenin, being a committed \noverseer of terror, mostly turned a blind eye. Stalin offered no threat to \nhis primacy among Bolsheviks. \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHis talent was indisputable. Lenin is said to have commented to him \nafter the October Revolution: 'And what if the White Guards kill you \nand me.'43 It suited Lenin \nadmirably that Trotski had to impose organisation and discipline in the \nRed Army. Several Bolsheviks who had been prominent \nbefore and even during 1917 failed to cope with the tasks of \ngovernment. But Lenin wished to preserve the leading group in \nplace, and everyone now knew who the main figures were: Lenin, \nTrotski, Stalin, Sverdlov, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Dzierzynski and \nBukharin. This inner core held sway by 1918-1919, and would supply \nthe major players in the struggle to succeed Lenin.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. Only Lenin's premature \ndeath could have so juddered the politics of the Kremlin. Sverdlov and \nLenin had at least tried to make the other leaders work with some \nsemblance of harmony.49 \nSverdlov's death gave impetus for a re-organisation of the central \nparty apparatus. The Kremlin dyarchy of Lenin and Sverdlov would \nhave been ended in any event. \nLenin anticipated the re-organisation with equanimity. Lenin desired the intermittent \nfractiousness to be replaced by unified action in the Civil War. \nTHE FIRST CONGRESS OF COMINTERN \nThere were few more famous politicians in the world than Lenin. Lenin and his party were held in quarantine by \nEurope's governments. Lenin was thinking flexibly. \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDetestation of Kautsky did not discourage him from hoping that a \nGerman Communist Party, once formed, might recruit members from \nthe Independent German Social-Democratic Party, and to this end he \nhimself drafted a short article. On reflection he decided that more harm than good might \nresult at a moment when he and his Central Committee colleagues were \nlaying the ground for a Congress heralded since 1914 in Lenin's \ndeclarations: the inaugurative meeting of the Third Internationa1. The basis of the \ninvitations should be a particular party's willingness to support soviet \npower and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear.56 \nHe arranged a meeting to take place on 21 January 1919 between \nCentral Committee representatives, led by himself and Trotski, and \nforeign communists working in Moscow. s9 \nLenin opened the proceedings on 2 March 1919 by saying: 'In \naccordance with the behest of the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, I am opening the first international communist \ncongress. The difference lent the proceedings a greater implicit \nauthority; and, by referring to his party as the initiator of the \nCongress, he emphasised the special role of the Bolsheviks. Lenin and \nhis Russian comrades were pulled up short by the German Communist \nParty representative Hugo Eberlein who accurately sensed that his \nRussian hosts would exploit the opportunity to take complete control \nof the Communist International if a consultative meeting or conference \nwere to he turned into a full-scale Congress.62 Lenin in turn was both exigent and conciliatory. But he \nadded, in order to attract any doubting delegates, that the need for \nsuch a dictatorship had become 'comprehensible to the broad masses of \nworkers thanks to soviet power in Russia, thanks to the Spartakists in \nGermany and analogous organisations in other countries such as, for \nexample, the Shop Stewards Committees in England'. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The revolutionary grouping in \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFrance had fewer than a dozen members. The remainder were \nalready resident in Moscow; it was laughable to pretend that such \npersons were not under the control, direct or not, of the Bolsheviks: \nseveral were Bolshevik party members. The contradictions of the \nrecords and memoirs of the next two days of consultations indicate the \nskullduggery at play; loyal Bolsheviks, then and later, wanted to \nsanitise the dirty work.66 On the \nsame day Lenin delivered his theses 'on bourgeois democracy and the \ndictatorship of the proletariat'. The Bolsheviks by then had their tails \nup. Nothing in the theses was novel for Russia since October 1917; but \nLenin sketched ideas which, for the West, were highly unusual. He followed this with a denunciation of the Independent \nGerman Social-Democratic Party for its hostility to Russian soviets \nand to German workers' councils. Lenin had \nmade the decisive achievement in founding his own International, and \nwisely refrained from pushing the Bolshevik demands too hard. Nor did Lenin discuss the role of the party. Proof of \nthe Russian Communist Party's intention to lord it over the \nInternational came with the choice of authors for the Congress's \nplatform, its resolution on the Berne Conference, its theses on the \ninternational situation and its manifesto. The platform, accepted by the Congress on 4 March, \nsketched the proletariat's advance to the inauguration of socialism by \nbreaking with Kautskyism and overthrowing the bourgeois state \nmachine. 71 On 5 March, Zinoviev's resolution on the Berne conference \nresumed the attack on Kautskyism, retailing the Bolshevik version of \nthe inter-socialist controversies about the Great War and asserting that \nthe Second International currently gave 'service to international \nreaction'.73 \nTrotski rounded off the Bolshevik contribution with a draft \nmanifesto which summarised the deliberations at the Congress in \ntypically vivid and compelling language. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).75 Lenin, having opened the Congress modestly, closed it in \nsimilar vein.] the \nmovement in favour of the Soviets is spreading further and further; and \nthis movement is nothing other than a movement aimed at the creation \nof a new, proletarian democracy: it is the most significant step forward \nto the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the complete victory of \ncommunism. At hand is the foundation of an international Soviet \nrepublic.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Lenin, especially after \nSverdlov's untimely death, was blamed for failing to co-ordinate the \ncivilian party apparatus; Trotski was castigated for co-ordinating the \narmed forces to the detriment of party traditions and personnel. The leading Bolshevik in \nNizhni Novgorod, Lazar Kaganovich, insisted that organisational \n Only One Year \n73 \nreforms had not been carried far enough.78 He \nappeared to be unaware that Lenin and Sverdlov had already initiated \nsuch a system.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. Timofei Sapronov, Vladimir Maksimovski and Nikolai \nOsinski in Moscow province were prominent among them, calling for \nthe party to be co-ordinated more tightly. Authoritarianism, they claimed, \ndeprived the Bolsheviks of the organisational dynamism that had \nserved them well in the October Revolution. A sense had been growing in late 1918 that the so-called \nduumvirate of Lenin and Sverdlov had to be brought to an end. No one felt \nthat Lenin did not work hard. Nor could there be any suspicion that \nSovnarkom would be more efficiently organised under someone other \nthan Lenin. Lenin was gently chided \nnot so much for lacking organising talent as for omitting to take \nmeasures to support himself with a carefully-co-ordinated team of \norganisationally-talented personnel. 84 \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe figure of Trotski by contrast evoked outright resentment. His \nearly anti-Bolshevik career had led many to demur at his recruitment to \nthe party in mid-1917.86 While no one questioned Lenin's sincerity, Trotski came \nwidely under suspicion as the cuckoo in the Bolshevik nest. Trotski admitted in 1919 \nthat 'Bonapartism' might arise in the revolutionary army; but the more \nacute danger to the Soviet state, he averred, stemmed from Bolsheviks \nin the armed forces who were incompetent or obstructive. Lenin did not disavow Trotski's policy; on the \ncontrary, he spoke several times in the winter of 1918-1919 in favour of \nthe enlistment of 'bourgeois specialists' in the Red Army. Thereafter, according to Trotski, Lenin supported Trotski.91 \nAs late as 13 March, however, Lenin avoided antagonising Trotski's \ncritics and referred to them at a meeting in Petrograd as 'belonging to \nthe numbers of the most dedicated and convinced Bolshevik-\nCommunists'.93 On 14 March, still not having departed for the front, \nTrotski chanced his arm by getting the Central Committee to agree to \nprohibit leading Bolsheviks in the Red Army from attending the \nCongress unless a special request were to be made.96 In addition, Lenin further \nassuaged Stalin's feelings by recommending his appointment as \nPeople's Commissar for State Control (even though this was passed \nonly on a split vote). Sergei Minin, who had befriended \nStalin in Tsaritsyn in mid-1918, was the most prominent such \nindividual. Lenin would not have made the same \nmistake. \nLenin delivered a eulogy of the late Yakov Sverdlov. International relations had dominated the \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprevious Party Congress, and most party officials had been swept into \nmilitary work in subsequent months. Yet Lenin told the 263 voting \ndelegates that the crucial current question was the party's attitude to \nthe 'middle peasantry'. \nLenin was curt with refusals to serve on such bodies: 'You can't \ndecline, comrade Muranov. Bolsheviks applauded thunderously. 106 These included not only Left \nCommunists but also the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. 107 The party had also had to feel its way in building a Red \nArmy. Lenin \nsuggested that it was only with the creation of the committees of poor \npeasants that the rural dimension of the October Revolution entered its \n'proletarian' phase. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants. Lenin remarked: 'Organisational activity \nhas never been a strong side of Russians in general and Bolsheviks in \nparticular, and meanwhile the main task of the proletarian revolution is \nprecisely an organisational task. 111 Lenin was spared a \nfurther bruising by the lateness of the hour, by his prestige and by the \nCongress's knowledge that the mastermind of the Secretariat, Yakov \nSverdlov, was no longer alive to answer the accusations. But Lenin was a master of \nrhetorical distraction. He acknowledged that 'a decree has not yet been \nissued for all countries to live by the Bolshevik revolutionary calendar', \nbut insisted that the prospect of European revolution had not \nvanished. Georgi \nPyatakov, Lenin's oldest Bolshevik opponent on the national question, \nattacked him. Finnish independence, granted by Lenin to Svinhufvud \nin December 1917, was castigated as a fiasco. 123 Only Central Committee colleague Aleksei Rykov supported \nLenin unequivocally. 124 Lenin, of course, did not intend to facilitate \ndemands for separation from Russia by non-Russian nations. As Lenin put \nit, 'Come across any communist and you'll discover a Great Russian \nchauvinist. 127 Zinoviev roused the \nCongress by claiming that the Russian Communist Party had won the \nright to exercise ideological leadership over all far-left socialists, and \nhis report was unanimously approved. 135 Lenin \ndetermined to stay clear of the dispute if at all possible. Okulov, another of Trotski's staff, \ncondemned the Bolshevik leaders on the Southern front who had \nnotoriously imprisoned 'military specialists' on a river barge rather \nthan admit them into their forces. \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nYet his disagreements with Lenin were evident.140 Lenin waded in. Lenin \nrevealed that the Bolsheviks on the Southern front had lost 60,000 men \nin battles against forces which were numerically inferior by far. Lenin \nrepudiated Stalin's implied charge that the leadership of the Red Army \nwas thwarting the Central Committee's will. Trotski's name had to be \ncleared, and Lenin did this without compunction. Lenin had cast in his lot with Trotski, and the \ndelegates were not inclined to rock the boat in wartime. Stalin had played his hand cleverly enough to be selected for it \nas a member of those 174 delegates (against 95) who had voted on \nLenin's side. Osinski in \nparticular had claimed that, while Lenin and Sverdlov had been \nacting as the Central Committee, there had been 'no political line'.150 Osinski, retorting \nthat Lenin himself had admitted that 'personal politics' had been \ndeveloping, focussed on the bureaucratic phenomena in party and \ngovernment and demanded a return to the elective principle. 151 Sapronov \nsupported him: he complained that too many abuses of power were \nreversible only by face-to-face pleadings with Lenin, who would then \nintervene directly. A Soviet republic had been proclaimed in Budapest. Lenin could claim that it indicated a \ncommitment to self-determination, Bukharin that the reference to \nunequal rights was not applicable in the areas under the party's control \n(since the Soviet Constitution guaranteed national equality). The gap between Lenin and Bukharin \n(and Stalin) had not been bridged, and the bruising disputes of 1920--\n1923 would show how wide it was. 161 But Sokolnikov had been compelled to make \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfurther concessions. Lenin understood this; \nTrotski did not. But even Lenin failed to follow things as closely as he \nhad needed. Among the speakers, a certain \nPanfilov criticised Lenin's pessimism and especially recommended \ncollectivisation for the prosperous agricultural communities of \nUkraine. 168 Lenin had not been without support, 169 but had had to \nspeak robustly to bend the commission his way. 171 Lenin announced the \nresults of the Central Committee elections. Lenin brightly assured the Congress: 'We \nare convinced that this will be the last heavy half-year. '172 The \nHungarian socialist revolution pointed the way to the future.' 173 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nThe development of Lenin's political ideas ought not to be assessed \nexclusively through books he wrote such as What Is To be Done.176 There was a discreet abandonment \nof the idea, as proposed by Lenin in 1917, that workers and poor \npeasants would jointly rule Russia. 178 \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRevolutionary wars could be anticipated as the struggle between \nsocialism and capitalism intensified. \nThe Soviet state had purportedly led the way in legislating for 'a higher \nform of democratism'. 181 This was all \nconfident stuff (which the commission, on Bukharin's suggestion, had \nasked Lenin to insert in the draft). The rights of \nnational self-determination and secession, which Lenin had demanded, \nwere obfuscated in the final version: this was the single major defeat he \nsuffered in the discussions on the party programme. 185 But his efforts \nensured that the programme was not without potential appeal to the \nnon-Russian peoples, even if Marxist jargon was used: 'Proletarians \nand semi-proletarians of the various nationalities' were to be drawn \ninto collaborative activities. Lenin's original draft had been written in the heat of the \ncontroversy between Trotski and the Military Opposition, and had \navoided mention of the Red Army. 192 Lenin managed to effect a blend \nof clear intention and reassuring rhetoric which he had failed to obtain \non the national question. Thus 'a struggle against the \nbureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of Soviet power' would \nbe waged. The Soviet regime begged \nfor the support of the so-called labouring masses. \nNo reference to the one-party state, to the Red Terror, to the Cheka, to \nthe imposition of a uniform official ideology, the persecution of other \npolitical parties, to the forced-labour concentration camps. Eulogies of revolutionary justice, \nallowing the Bolsheviks and their supporters to feel unrestricted even \nby their own legislation, marked out a strategy for the party in the \npost-war epoch. Lenin wanted to show confidence in the durability of \nthe Soviet regime in Russia and the surrounding regions. \nBulwarks against the deployment of power in a manner undesirable \neven to the Bolshevik party are considered still more casually than in \nLenin's The State and Revolution.", "Prominent_In_Ushering_1917": " 15 On the other hand, it remains \nremarkable that he offered only a few brief sentences on events which \nhad a great impact upon the military and political conflicts of 1917.f counter-revolutionary influences'.", "Forgery_Of_Documents_1917": " Possibly Kozlovski \nsent a cheque through to Petrograd;64 but the extent of forgery of \ndocuments by officials of the Provisional Government has yet to be \nascertained.", "Answer_To_Hindenburg_1917": " Yet the German and Austrian representatives were \nnot free agents; they had to answer to Hindenburg and Ludendorff.", "Bolshevik_Power_1917": " 9 The View from \nPetrograd: November to \nDecember 1917 \nNEGOTIATIONS ON POWER \nThe 'October Revolution' was not a single act which titanically \nprescribed the entire political process for the rest of the country. \nRussia and its subject regions in 1917 experienced myriads of further \nrevolutions after the fall of the Romanov dynasty, in cities, in the \narmed forces, and in the villages. Consequently, the Bolshevik Central Committee, with \nmuch skill and not a little luck, linked its political revolution in \nPetrograd to the revolutions elsewhere. Yet the Bolshevik Central Committee appreciated \nthat, in the disintegrated and localised condition of politics at the \ntime, the Petrograd seizure remained as yet a local revolution. 'Soviet power' under the Bolshevik aegis had to be \ndisseminated across the country. This undertaking would put the \nstrategy of Lenin to its greatest test. \nIn those first weeks it was unclear whether the Bolshevik-led \nrevolution in Petrograd would prove adequate to guide and \ndominate the others. Russian politics were in \na state of flux. Such had been the impotence of the Provisional \nGovernment and the hostility towards it that a socialist government \nof some sort would probably have emerged in late 1917 even if Lenin \nhad not returned to Russia across Germany in his sealed train. But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. \nAnd yet both Lenin and Trotski had returned from emigration, \nand their activity in late October gave them a directing influence over \nthe design of the government and its policies which emerged from the \nuprising in Petrograd. With an impudent astuteness, which has been \nlargely overlooked by historians, Lenin had succeeded in persuading \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee to steer a course towards estab-\nlishing a government without debating the same government's \npersonal composition. In reality, neither Lenin nor Trotski had the \nslightest intention of sharing power with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. The title of Lenin's letter to the Central \nCommittee, 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power', gave an enormous \nhint about his aims; and his endless criticism and ridiculing of the \nMensheviks as being a 'petit-bourgeois party' in pursuit of 'social-\nchauvinism' was scarcely an attitude conducive to co-operation with \nthem. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out. 2 \nEven so, it is mysterious why so many leading Bolsheviks stayed \nblissfully unable to recognise the extent of Lenin's intransigence. 3 It took the October \nRevolution to expose the fact that Lenin and Trotski were political \nliteralists.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. Dan and Chernov detested Lenin and \nTrotski both politically and personally and the October Revolution \nmerely sealed the lid of their hatred. \nLenin found it hard enough to keep his own Bolsheviks united in the \nwinter of 1917-18, and the dispute over the signature of a separate \npeace in March 1918 was to come near to breaking up his party. In such a role he had no \nequal in Russian politics. He had also acquired a co-leader in the \nperson of Trotski who had the determination to strengthen his case \nin the Bolshevik Central Committee. Nevertheless, Lenin and Trotski had to face certain \nunpleasant realities. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. Out of 366 \nsoviets and army committees represented at the Second Congress of \nSoviets, according to an incomplete but believable questionnaire, 255 \nhad sent delegates to Petrograd on this basis; and no delegate had \nbeen dispatched with a mandate to seek the extrusion of non-\nBolsheviks from the new government. 5 \nThe exodus of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from \nthe Congress had eased Lenin's position by permitting the claim that \nthey had implicitly repudiated the objective of a general socialist \ncoalition. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. Lenin's tactics had to be those of a spoiler; he could not \ncountermand the inter-party discussions. In addition, it was not yet \nclear that the efforts of ex-premier Kerenski and General Krasnov to \neject the Bolsheviks from power would prove fruitless. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. This encouraged the Menshevik \nInternationalists and leftists in the Jewish Bund to canvass more \nstrongly in their parties for the inception of talks designed to produce \na compromise with the Bolsheviks and an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment.6 The Bolshevik Central Committee convened on 29 \nOctober. Lenin and Trotski did not attend, and their absence remains \nunexplained. But it is also possible that neither Lenin nor \nTrotski yet wanted to be seen as obvious road blocks in the way of \ninter-socialist harmony; or that they had already determined on \ncoalition talks as a delaying tactic until such time as the Bolsheviks \nwere in a stronger position. Certainly Lenin, by 1 November, was \ndescribing the negotiations as merely 'a diplomatic cover for military \nactions'. Kamenev was present at the \nBolshevik Central Committee session on 29 October; and he and \nG. 10 \nBy then Lenin was feeling less constrained. 13 Trotski resumed the \npolitical offensive in the Bolshevik Central Committee on I \nNovember, opposing the exclusion of Lenin from any coalition. The Bolsheviks, he exclaimed, had not made a \nrevolution merely to negotiate it away. The Central Committee, siding with Lenin, \ncalled for talks to be resumed, but for Bolshevik representatives to \ndeliver the ultimatum that the other parties accept the Bolshevik \nparty line on peace, land, workers' control, food supplies and the \nstruggle with Kaledin and Kerenski. The Decree on the Press led to raids on non-Bolshevik \nnewspapers such as the liberal-owned Rech and even Den, which \nwas run by the right-wing Menshevik (and one-time collaborator of \nLenin's) A. The Mensheviks, under Martov's influence, \ndemanded on 2 November the liberation of all political prisoners \nalong with an end to military actions and to what they referred to as \nthe Bolshevik 'terror'. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. Bolshevik power in Moscow \n The View from Petrograd \n277 \nhad been secured; Vikzhel's authority over its own railwaymen was \nsuccessfully challenged by the creation of a new union under \nBolshevik direction; and food supplies were at last reaching central \nRussia from the Volga.20 The necessity of further pretence, in the \neyes of Lenin and Trotski, had evaporated. Lenin drew up an ultimatum: either they obtained the \nparty's approval to form a coalition government, and Lenin would \nfeel free to campaign against such a government; or else Lenin would \nobtain the party's sanction and the opposition itself would campaign \nagainst Sovnarkom.21 \nNo one with the merest acquaintance with Bolshevik history could \nthink that Lenin was bluffing; he seemed to live by the motto: 'If in \ndoubt, split. They felt that, while Lenin's position had \nstrengthened somewhat, their own was far from being hopeless. An \nalready isolated Bolshevik government was getting ready to isolate \nitself further from several of the most prominent Bolshevik leaders. In total, five out of fifteen People's \nCommissars refused to continue to work in Sovnarkom because of \nopposition to Lenin's and Trotski's intransigence. 24 \nYet Lenin's nerve held; and Trotski, far from apologising for the \nrestrictions on press freedom, gloried in the arguments for repres-\nsion. 25 Lenin was not so abrasive in public. The Council of \nPeople's Commissars aspired to rule a country with a majority of \npeasants, and it was vital to reassure the peasantry that Bolshevik \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintentions were pure. Mariya Spiridonova and the other Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries could not be treated dismissively, even \nthough they had refused to join the Soviet government at the \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies continued to attend the sessions of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, badgering the \nCouncil of People's Commissars with criticisms of its officials' \nconduct. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. It galled the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries that Lenin and not Spiridonova had signed the \nDecree on Land, which Lenin unembarrassedly admitted was a \ndecree purloined from Socialist Revolutionaries. Left Socialist Revolutionaries tended to lay a \nlesser blame on the Bolsheviks than on the anti-Bolsheviks for the \nbreakdown of talks. They formed their own separate party in \nNovember 1917 and openly opposed Chernov at the Second All-\nRussian Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. With this mandate from peasant Russia in their \npockets, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries felt able to re-enter \nnegotiations with the Bolsheviks. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. 30 \nTHE SPREAD OF SOVIET POWER \nLenin's energies were large but not infinite. \nHowever, in November 1917 he had no choice but to entrust \nprovincial contacts to Yakov Sverdlov. Lenin's disrespect for him \nhad long disappeared. The workers, soldiers and peasants had nothing to fear \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nexcept fear itself: the lower social orders of Russia, he declared, had \nto make their own :evolution. The \nSmolny Institute teemed with people who had come off Petrograd's \nstreets and brought news of the dislocation produced by the October \nRevolution; but Lenin, who had had much success in identifying \nhimself with the cause of the working class, gave little evidence of \nacquaintance with the concrete circumstances produced by the \nseizure of power. Violent incidents recurred in the capital; and \nadministrative confusion abounded as the new structures of author-\nity were constructed and challenged, sometimes by the Bolsheviks \nthemselves. While being warm \nand inspiring in face-to-face meetings in the Institute, Lenin \ncontinued to write the austere prose of the theorist of socialist \nrevolution. Asked for advice and assistance by the Berdyansk \nBolshevik Committee, he responded: 'You understand, comrade, \nthat it is difficult to give you instructions any more concrete than \n\"All Power To The Soviets\". '35 Local Bolsheviks \nwere simply implored to make their own political arrangements and \nkeep an eye on the central party newspaper for general guidance. The \nCentral Committee was acting in accordance with the stated \nBolshevik philosophy of a dual revolution from above and from \nbelow; but it was equally a reflection of practical possibilities. And \nleast of all did Lenin, the father of Bolshevik centralism, believe in \nprinciple in non-intervention in local affairs. Moscow \nwas a case in point. Not only Moscow but also the town of Vladimir and the \nDonbass region were discussed, but the topics related to nationalisa-\ntion and financial assignations rather than to detailed political \n The View from Petrograd \n281 \nguidance and military support; and it had been local Bolshevik and \nsoviet organs which had put them on to the agenda. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. The transfer of authority was in \nany case easier in most other cities and towns of central Russia than \nin Moscow.38 Urban soviets in the region either were already under \nBolshevik influence or else had a large and growing contingent of \nBolshevik deputies. Some \nsoviets had for months been in the hands of socialists seeking the \nProvisional Government's overthrow. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. In \nTambov it took some days of violence before the transfer of power \nwas effected, but in Nizhni Novgorod, there was little armed \nconflict;41 and the soldiers in the Kazan garrison were so pro-\nBolshevik that other groups in the population offered no resis-\ntance. In Simbirsk, the native town of Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-\nLenin, fighting broke out but the rapid victory of the pro-Bolshevik \nforces was never in serious doubt. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918.43 Lenin's decrees and proclamations had had an \nundoubted impact. This concern to rouse the local soviets, \ntrade unions and factory-workshop committees to revolutionary \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \naction helps to explain why Lenin, a trained jurist, was vague to the \npoint of remissness in framing the legislation.44 \nLenin was accustomed to explaining party policies in greater detail \nthrough the Bolshevik press, but this was no longer physically \npossible for an overworked politician.45 Visits from provincial Bolsheviks were another channel of \ncontact, but neither Lenin nor his visitors could expend many hours \nin verbal exchanges. A \nlarge influx of party activists from the provinces could only have \nmeant that the Bolsheviks were being forced to flee. And, when \nreportage on local developments reached Petrograd (and it must be \nborne in mind that Sverdlov was meeting more people),47 Sovnarkom \nand the Bolshevik Central Committee were confirmed in their \noptimism. He \nknew that, unless the villages sided with or at least failed to oppose \nthe Bolsheviks, all the political progress in the towns might be \nreversed. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. Despite Bolshevik fears, there was a widespread \ndistaste in the officer corps at all levels for intervening in politics. And yet the chances of \nmobilising regiments against the Bolsheviks were as slim as in the \nnorth. Many \ncarried with them the first information that an October Revolution \nhad occurred and that a leader called Lenin had issued a Decree on \nLand. Lenin lent his support in the \nSmolny Institute, listening to peasant complaints and encouraging \nthem to push forward with revolutionary measures. 5\u00b0 But the process \nalso had its own dynamic; peasant soviets were increasingly being set \nup in Russia in late 1917.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. Lenin had made his name as an economist in the 1890s \nby trying to demonstrate that the communal arrangements of the \nRussian peasantry were a vehicle of rural capitalism. \nSECESSION AND FEDERATION \nThe Bolsheviks could not afford to be satisfied with their successes in \nthe Russian heartland, and aspired to spreading 'soviet power' to the \nnon-Russian segments of the old empire; and Lenin was especially \nkeen to embark upon a process of what we nowadays would call 'de-\ncolonisation'. The 'nationalities' were to be courted, \nRussian chauvinism disavowed. Yet Lenin, unlike the members of \nBritish and French cabinets in the 1950s, did not expect the result to \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbe a large number of new nation-states. 54 Lenin's Decree on \nPeace, on 26 October, repeated the idea that no nation in Europe \nshould be forcibly retained within the confines of a state against its \nwill. In the meantime, on 2 \nNovember, a Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia \nwas accepted by Sovnarkom and issued next day under the signature \nof Stalin and Lenin; it called for 'a voluntary and honourable union of \nthe peoples of Russia', abolishing all previous national privileges and \nother discriminations and confirming the right of each nation to \nsecession. Much heat had disappeared from intra-\nBolshevik discussions about the non-Russian nationalities by \nsummer 1917,57 and Lenin acted with a stealthy purposiveness. Lenin hoped \nthat Finnish independence would be secured by a revolutionary \nsocialist administration of Finns. Lenin's letters to Finnish social-democrats before the \nOctober Revolution reveal how badly he misjudged the socialists of \nFinland even though he had spent the summer among them. Offers of direct military assistance from \nthe Bolshevik commanders of the Russian naval garrisons in Finland \ndid not dispel Wiik's caution. and his colleagues organised a \ngeneral strike in Finland's cities; but they resisted the Bolshevik plea \nto make a revolution because they neither wanted civil war nor were \nconvinced that the Soviet government would long survive in \nRussia. The \nBolsheviks made clear that they would grant independence even to \nSvinhufvud's cabinet.62 \nThe fiasco of forcing independence down the throats of Finnish \npoliticians proved that those contemporaries who felt that Lenin had \nno ideological beliefs and was exclusively an unprincipled power-\nseeker had misunderstood him. Nevertheless, those \nBolsheviks who had argued against Lenin's line on secession were \nbuoyed up by the fiasco. \n 286 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe only other subject nation to be guaranteed sovereignty over its \naffairs was Poland. And yet this also \nmade it easier for the Bolshevik negotiators to gain support \nthroughout the party for the tactic of embarrassing the German \nand Austrian delegations at the peace talks in Brest-Litovsk by \naffirming the need for all peoples to be accorded the right of national \nself-determination.65 Neither Finland nor \nPoland were crucial to Russia's internal economic and political well-\nbeing in 1917, but the same was not true of the Ukraine. Lenin and \nStalin continued to goad the Finnish social-democrats into a seizure \nof power after December. They began carefully, relying both \non the attractiveness of their Decrees on Peace and on Land, and on \nthe ability of Ukrainian Bolsheviks to seize power for the soviets in \nKiev, Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav. But on 3 November 1917 it \nannounced that, in the absence of a legitimate and effective power for \nthe Ukraine, it was assuming power. No Bolshevik leader yet approved \nthe principles of federalism. 66 \nThe Bolsheviks in Kiev avoided a clash with the Rada, but \nprepared for the forthcoming Congress of Soviets in the Ukraine. \nBut the Rada steadfastly opposed Sovnarkom and linked up with the \nanti-Bolshevik force among the Don Cossacks. A clash in Kiev was \ninevitable, especially after the arrest of Bolshevik leaders in Kiev in \nlate November. A \ndifficulty for the Bolsheviks was that the Ukrainian Congress of \nSoviets in Kiev found them in a minority. 69 The Bolsheviks \nadjourned to Kharkov, held their own rival Congress of Soviets \nand - guided now by their left-wing leaders- moved to seize power in \nall major cities. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance.71 The Ukrainian Bolshevik leftists, \nwho regarded such suggestions as an undesirable concession to \nnationalism, were displeased. 72 But they needed Petrograd's support \nand succumbed to Lenin's pressure; and the knowledge of their \nelectoral weakness in the Ukraine dissuaded them from disobedience \nto the Bolshevik Central Committee. \nNone the less, a sea-change in Lenin's attitude had occurred. Nor did \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBukharin and the Bolshevik left have a practical alternative. But inaction had \nnever been a Bolshevik virtue; and Lenin skilfully advocated a \npractical plan which at least had the merit, in the eyes of Bolshevik \nleftists, of seeking the retention of a multinational state. Bolsheviks came to power in Baku, in \nAzerbaidzhan (as it was coming to be called); but the local Moslem \nparties and influences grew in the surrounding countryside: the \nchances of an anti-Russian alliance was growing. In Armenia, the \nzeal to break with Russia was weaker; but the Bolsheviks held little \ninfluence and would have only weakened their position if concessions \nto national feeling had not been forthcoming. In Siberia, the Socialist \nRevolutionaries were attempting to set up an autonomous state \nadministration. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. In Estonia, the Tallin Soviet \nannounced the inception of 'soviet power' in November. Yet nationalist feelings were \nundeniably growing in fervour; and the signs were few that a robust \npro-Sovietism pervaded the non-Russian regions. 78 \nPOLITICAL REPRESSION \nSovnarkom's main worries of the moment were concentrated on \nRussia. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks. Attentive \nobservers of Lenin before the October Revolution can hardly have \nbeen surprised. He had \nurged the need for a system of civil rights and judicial procedures \nwhich expressly discriminated against the bourgeoisie; and he had \ndescribed all parties to the right of the Bolsheviks as mere \nappendages of the Kadets and their pro-bourgeois interests.79 \nBut it was only after the October Revolution that most people who \nsupported the Bolsheviks became fully aware of his ferocity.80 Viktor Nogin, on \nresigning his post as People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, \npredicted that the Soviet government would steadily move towards \ntt::rrorist techniques if the Bolsheviks refused to form a broad socialist \ncoalition.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. On the contrary, Lenin approved its use by the \nJacobins in the French Revolution; and, at the Third Party Congress \nin 1905, the Bolsheviks displayed a willingness to resort to it in \nRussia if the need appeared to arise.82 Lenin's approval of mass \nterror was accompanied by a rejection of the populist-terrorist tactic \nof assassinations of individual state officials as a means of bringing \nabout a crisis of the Romanov state.84 There is no firm evidence available that Lenin and colleagues \nsuch as Trotski were hell-bent, before the October Revolution, on \ninstigating a campaign of summary arrest and execution of large \nnumbers of people who had committed no crime but who happened \nto belong to a social category deemed politically inimical to the \nregime. Lenin made threats on political opponents quickly after the \nseizure of power.'85 \nSystematic summary repression which did not go as far as gross \nphysical maltreatment or capital punishment occurred with not only \nthe sanction but even the straightforward encouragement of the \ncentral Soviet authorities in the first month of Soviet power, and \nseveral weeks before the establishment of the All-Russian Extra-\nordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Specula-\ntion and Sabotage (or, as it appears in its Russian acronym: the \nCheka), which is rightly regarded as the forerunner of today's KGB. \nSuch repression was undertaken by organs which, at Lenin's \ndirection, were kept deliberately unaccountable for their actions. \nThe facility of Lenin's resort to terror raises a question about the \nsincerity of his pre-October statements. It is also true that the \nscale of terror was raised only gradually by Lenin. \nSeveral Bolshevik leaders expected that the People's Commissar-\niats of Internal Affairs and of Justice would preside over law and \norder, but Lenin had other ideas. At a \nSovnarkom session under Lenin's chairmanship on 15 November, a \ndecision was taken to transfer various matters from the People's \nCommissariat of Internal Affairs to the Military-Revolutionary \nCommittee. Lenin encouraged them and protected them against \ncomplaints. 87 \nAdmittedly, the Bolshevik Central Committee and Sovnarkom \nwere not hallucinating when they talked of enemies who planned or \ncould reasonably be expected to plan armed opposition towards the \nBolsheviks. The Bolsheviks had seized power; they could scarcely \nanticipate a pat on the back from their foes. There is a 'road to \nDublin' aspect to this argument; for no one had forced Lenin and \nTrotski to grasp power in the way they did: they could hardly \ndemand sympathy for their subsequent dilemmas. Even so, Lenin left \nnothing to chance. Closures of non-Bolshevik newspapers continued. Lenin brushed them casually \naside. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety.95 The speed of \nLenin's turn to repressive measures leaves little doubt that before \nOctober he had been holding back in public about his intentions. When other leading Bolsheviks sought to \nrestrain Dzierzynski, Lenin freed him to follow his repressive \ninstincts. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. \nYet Lenin, too, was pondering the excessive optimism of the \nBolshevik left with growing agitation; he was relieved, in early \nDecember, when Zinoviev resumed his Central Committee seat.97 Dukhonin procrastinated and was replaced by \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Bolshevik N. 99 Lenin and Trotski issued a proclamation \nblaming the Allied powers for compelling them to take the step. 101 \nThe Allied governments perceived that unofficial contact with \nSovnarkom was vital to inhibit Russia's complete disengagement \nfrom the War. Trotski met with their various representatives in \nPetrograd 102 Lenin, either because of preoccupation with domestic \naffairs or else because he wished others to be tainted with \ninvolvement in such unpleasant duties, held himself aloof. Trotski was already \npondering aloud whether the Russians could carry on fighting if \nGermany failed to have its expected socialist revolution. 103 Lenin, mean-\nwhile, persisted in his silence about revolutionary war. 104 He and \nTrotski at least agreed that, for the moment, the talks with the \nCentral Powers at Brest-Litovsk should be used as an instrument for \nspreading Soviet propaganda to the workers and soldiers of \nGermany. The ingenuity of the new diplomacy of the Bolsheviks \nwas countered by the subtlety of the German and Austrian \nnegotiators. Far from being embarrassed by the Soviet demand for \n'national self-determination' as the principle to underlie any general \npeace in Europe, German Foreign Secretary Ricard von Kuhlmann \nemployed it to undermine the Bolsheviks' pretensions to sovereignty \n The View from Petrograd \n295 \nover most of the old Russian empire. Consultations of popular \nopinion in the Ukraine and in regions of the Baltic provinces and the \nTranscaucasus would predictably fail to produce pro-Bolshevik \nmajorities. The Soviet \ndelegation was headed by A. Joffe, who resembled Trotski \ninasmuch as he was a left-wing Marxist who had joined the \nBolshevik party only in 1917. 106 \nLenin entered a trough of agitation. The Bolshevik \npeace policy called on soldiers to help to end the war by fraternising \nwith German soldiers and spreading the revolutionary contagion to \nthe enemy armed forces; but Russian peasants-in-uniform preferred \nsimply to desert. Soon, not only revolutionary enthusiasm among the \nRussian soldiers would be lacking, but the Russian soldiers too. 107 On 18 December, Lenin came to Sovnark-\nom with a motion stressing the need to prepare Petrograd's \ndefences. The response of \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe delegates confirmed Lenin's fears, and indeed suggested that he \nmight not be pessimistic enough. 110 \nThe precise time of Lenin's change of heart is unknown. 112 So Lenin's \nmental shift was not lightly undertaken. There is an unknown factor here: the extent \nof political contacts and 'understandings', if any, between Lenin and \nthe Berlin government. The Germans had had an interest in helping \nthe Bolsheviks to take power, and rejoiced in the news of the October \nRevolution. But whether the Berlin government stretched out a \nhelping hand to Lenin in the last two months of 1917 is undiscover-\nable from available documents (although the German diplomats at \nBrest-Litovsk acted as if they were offering little concession, \nmonetary or political, to the Bolsheviks). 114 Yet Lenin also wished to plan carefully for the contingency \nthat such a revolution would not come to Sovnarkom's rescue and \nthat a separate peace might prove necessary. Bolshevik leaders, while \nshowing an awareness in summer 1917 of the difficulties of fighting a \nrevolutionary war, had never suggested that the alternative option, \nnamely a separate peace, was acceptable. 115 They had always \nbelieved that, if it came to a choice between a separate peace and a \nwar of revolutionary defence, no Bolshevik should sign a treaty with \nthe Germans. 116 No date for a reply from Petrograd \nwas set, but Lenin foresaw that Trotski's delaying tactics might soon \nprove insufficient. On 24 December 1917, Lenin set out for a few \ndays' rest in a sanatorium near the Usikirkka village railway \nstation. He was plotting how to present \nhis volte-face on the idea of a separate peace to his fellow Bolsheviks. But Trotski \nfelt that the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries had no \noption but to prolong the talks and call the bluff of the Central \nPowers, hoping against hope that the German workers would rise \nagainst the Kaiser or that a debilitating mutiny would occur among \nthe German forces on active service; and, for the moment, it was \nTrotski's policy which guided the Soviet negotiators. Lenin, with \ndifficulty, bided his time. He had yet to make his decisive impact on \nthe issue that had played so great a role in the Bolshevik advance on \npower: the issue of war and peace. \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDARKENING THOUGHTS \nIntimidating developments at Brest-Litovsk did not dispel the \noptimism of the Bolshevik leaders in either Petrograd or the \nprovinces. Lenin continued to call for working-class initiative, to \nwelcome factory workers in person to the Smolny Institute and to \nproclaim the ultimate objectives of communism. His domestic \npolitical strategy in 1917, before the seizure of power, had been a \ncombination of the revolution from above with the revolution from \nbelow. \nStrongly-held doctrines were not peculiar to the Bolsheviks among \nRussian political parties in the revolutionary period. The question has been asked why \nLenin failed to make a more realistic assessment of his party's \ncapacities in the first months after the October Revolution. Why did Lenin not attempt this in \nthe winter of 1917-18. Would not the pressures for the Bolsheviks \nto become more authoritarian have been smaller. 121 \nYet the Bolsheviks did not entertain a second thought (or even a \nfirst one) about introducing greater latitude for trading on the \nprivate market. Moreover, a 'capitalist \ngovernment' had set up the state grain-trade monopoly before the \nBolsheviks seized power. The Bolsheviks, as far-left socialists, were \nhighly unlikely to regard a relaxation of controls on capitalism as \nan immediately desirable priority. 122 \nIn addition, Lenin was an extremist by the standards of most non-\nBolshevik Russian socialists, but his policies on several socio-\neconomic issues remained decidedly moderate in comparison with \nthose of many colleagues. Osinski and other \nBolshevik leftists were elaborating an agrarian policy involving the \nrapid collectivisation of peasant households. 123 Poor Lenin. He it \nhad been in the 1890s who had urged upon Russian Marxists that \ncapitalism in the countryside had achieved a high level of develop-\nment. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. 124 Pity for Lenin is, \nconsequently, scarcely in order. Even in The April Theses he had \nfudged the topic of 'model farms' and allowed Bolsheviks on the left \nto think that he and they were at one about agrarian policy. 127 \nThe hypothesis that Lenin had sufficient authority to introduce the \nideas of 1921 in 1917 badly misconstrues the ideological nature of \nBolshevism after the October Revolution; it also neglects the party's \norganisational disjointedness and localism. 128 \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe revolutionary elan persisted. The Saratov City Soviet, \nhaving replaced the agencies of the Provisional. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice. Kamenev, Zinoviev, \nMilyutin and other Bolshevik rightists had warned about the dangers \nof aggravating them; and Lenin, who had scoffed at the rightists' \nwarnings in October 1917, began to share their sentiments. On 4 \nNovember 1917 he announced to the Petrograd Soviet: 'Our \ndeficiency consists in the fact that our soviet organisation has not \nyet learnt to administer, that we hold too many meetings. 138 Even more impressive are the \nneglected shifts in Lenin's attitude to the working class. The fact that the print-workers were interested in the \nprotection of freedom of expression for non-Bolshevik political \nparties was a strange ground for dubbing them hooligans, but Lenin \nrampantly expanded the category of imprisonable people. These he \ndesignated as 'privileged workers' who were exercised only by their \nsectional interests (which, presumably, involved a continuation of the \nwar and therefore were counterposed to Lenin's policy for a separate \npeace). It had \nroots in his horrified and belated recognition of the dimensions and \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnature of the economic crisis; it was also traceable to the subordinate \nrole he had always placed on the workers as a social class whenever \nthey acted at variance with his policies. Bolsheviks, he declared, \nshould seek 'to help the labouring peasant, avoid offending the \nmiddle peasant and compel the rich peasant'. Thus Lenin \nmade a quick return to the themes of class war and of the attack on \nthe richer peasants.

But \nany socialist government, with or without him, would have con-\nfronted similar immense problems in trying to control, reconcile and \nco-ordinate the parallel revolutions of 1917. This has become so widespread a phenomenon since \nthe Second World War that it is important to recognise how \nextraordinary it was in 1917.

But he avoided the blatant advocacy of terror made \nby Trotski as early as l December: 'You wax indignant at the naked \nterror which we are applying against our class enemies, but let me tell \nyou that in one month's time at the most it will assume more terrible \nforms, modelled on the terror of the great French revolutionaries.

The \nseparate armistice with the Germans, furthermore, called for the \ninception of talks about a permanent peace.111 Certainly from mid-December, however, he was seriously \nconsidering whether to pull Russia out of the war by a separate \npeace. Bolshevik leaders, while \nshowing an awareness in summer 1917 of the difficulties of fighting a \nrevolutionary war, had never suggested that the alternative option, \nnamely a separate peace, was acceptable. 115 They had always \nbelieved that, if it came to a choice between a separate peace and a \nwar of revolutionary defence, no Bolshevik should sign a treaty with \nthe Germans. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to a man and \nwoman, were implacably opposed to a separate peace. \nOn 20 December 1917 the German peace terms were clarified. The \ncontroversy over a separate peace with Germany and Austria-\nHungary in the first three months of 1918 was about to show how \neasy it was for regional, provincial and city party committees to \nignore the central leadership's demands. 10 The Obscene Peace: \nJanuary to March 1918 \nTHE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY \nThe October Revolution's repercussions endure in many forms: the \npolitical map of Europe was lastingly affected.

No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. 58 Yet military conflict, in civil war and in foreign anti-\nBolshevik crusades, was expected. His 'Theses on the Question of a \nSeparate and Annexationist Peace' were considered outrageous. 80 \nA wedge existed between two tendencies of opinion hostile to a \nseparate peace; and Trotski had confided that, in the event of a \nGerman invasion, Lenin could count on his vote in favour of a \nseparate peace. Yet signs appeared that Lenin was gaining ground: five \nparticipants now voted in favour of a separate peace. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). Trotski, being prised out of his \n'neither war nor peace' position, declared that in such a contingency \nhe would favour a separate peace. A spontaneous separate peace \nbetween the soldiers of the two sides was one thing; a treaty was \nentirely another. The obscene peace, the separate \nand annexationist peace, was to be signed. Neither condition was met from January 1918 \nwhen rifts opened on the issues of war and peace. The \nargument over coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries in November 1917 had involved a similar recourse to the \nCentral Committee; but the three months of controversy over the \nproposed separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmore intense and set a powerful precedent for subsequent develop-\nmentsY1 \n The Obscene Peace \n323 \nThe party as a whole resumed greater importance when the Brest-\nLitovsk negotiations were discussed.

Shortages of personnel, funds and propaganda material \nwere more severe in the provinces than in Petrograd. The \nSmolny Institute teemed with people who had come off Petrograd's \nstreets and brought news of the dislocation produced by the October \nRevolution; but Lenin, who had had much success in identifying \nhimself with the cause of the working class, gave little evidence of \nacquaintance with the concrete circumstances produced by the \nseizure of power. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. A peaceful process was reported in Ivanovo-Voznesensk \nafter the arrival of news about the Petrograd insurrection on 27 \nOctober. \nTo the north-west, around Petrograd, it was the same story.

Svinhufvud did \nnot want to offend the Allies and wanted to obtain independence \nfrom the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd.

Yet the Bolshevik Central Committee appreciated \nthat, in the disintegrated and localised condition of politics at the \ntime, the Petrograd seizure remained as yet a local revolution. 'Soviet power' under the Bolshevik aegis had to be \ndisseminated across the country. This undertaking would put the \nstrategy of Lenin to its greatest test. \nIn those first weeks it was unclear whether the Bolshevik-led \nrevolution in Petrograd would prove adequate to guide and \ndominate the others. Nor was it even settled that Lenin and Trotski \n272 \n The View from Petrograd \n273 \nwould succeed in imposing their own particular vision on their \nCentral Committee colleagues.

With an impudent astuteness, which has been \nlargely overlooked by historians, Lenin had succeeded in persuading \nthe Bolshevik Central Committee to steer a course towards estab-\nlishing a government without debating the same government's \npersonal composition. In reality, neither Lenin nor Trotski had the \nslightest intention of sharing power with the Mensheviks and the \nSocialist Revolutionaries. The title of Lenin's letter to the Central \nCommittee, 'The Bolsheviks Must Seize Power', gave an enormous \nhint about his aims; and his endless criticism and ridiculing of the \nMensheviks as being a 'petit-bourgeois party' in pursuit of 'social-\nchauvinism' was scarcely an attitude conducive to co-operation with \nthem. 1 Lenin and Trotski did not make their opinion totally clear-cut \nuntil after 25 October: namely that they would countenance coalition \nonly with the more radical members of the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries who had remained at the Second Congress of \nSoviets when their centrist and right-wing fellow members had \nwalked out. 2 \nEven so, it is mysterious why so many leading Bolsheviks stayed \nblissfully unable to recognise the extent of Lenin's intransigence. 3 It took the October \nRevolution to expose the fact that Lenin and Trotski were political \nliteralists.4 \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin and Trotski were not alone in impeding the moves towards \na wider all-socialist coalition. Dan and Chernov detested Lenin and \nTrotski both politically and personally and the October Revolution \nmerely sealed the lid of their hatred. \nLenin found it hard enough to keep his own Bolsheviks united in the \nwinter of 1917-18, and the dispute over the signature of a separate \npeace in March 1918 was to come near to breaking up his party. He had also acquired a co-leader in the \nperson of Trotski who had the determination to strengthen his case \nin the Bolshevik Central Committee. The same Trotski who had \nonce depicted Lenin as an incorrigible non-compromiser had \nemerged as the leader second only to Lenin in his opposition to \ncompromise. Nevertheless, Lenin and Trotski had to face certain \nunpleasant realities. Firstly, the Bolsheviks were isolated from every \nother political force in the country; even the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries refused to join the Council of People's Commissars \n(or Sovnarkom). Secondly, several members of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee had made the October Revolution on the assumption \nthat 'soviet power' would be shared among all the various socialist \nparties and would not be a Bolshevik party monopoly. Out of 366 \nsoviets and army committees represented at the Second Congress of \nSoviets, according to an incomplete but believable questionnaire, 255 \nhad sent delegates to Petrograd on this basis; and no delegate had \nbeen dispatched with a mandate to seek the extrusion of non-\nBolsheviks from the new government. 5 \nThe exodus of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from \nthe Congress had eased Lenin's position by permitting the claim that \nthey had implicitly repudiated the objective of a general socialist \ncoalition. But talk about such a coalition was quickly resumed, not \nonly by Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries but also by other \nBolshevik leaders. Lenin's tactics had to be those of a spoiler; he could not \ncountermand the inter-party discussions. In addition, it was not yet \nclear that the efforts of ex-premier Kerenski and General Krasnov to \neject the Bolsheviks from power would prove fruitless. Lenin might \nyet need the help of the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries \n The View from Petrograd \n275 \neven as they in their past had needed the Bolsheviks to suppress the \nKornilov mutiny in August 1917. This encouraged the Menshevik \nInternationalists and leftists in the Jewish Bund to canvass more \nstrongly in their parties for the inception of talks designed to produce \na compromise with the Bolsheviks and an all-socialist coalition \ngovernment.6 The Bolshevik Central Committee convened on 29 \nOctober. Lenin and Trotski did not attend, and their absence remains \nunexplained. But it is also possible that neither Lenin nor \nTrotski yet wanted to be seen as obvious road blocks in the way of \ninter-socialist harmony; or that they had already determined on \ncoalition talks as a delaying tactic until such time as the Bolsheviks \nwere in a stronger position. Kamenev was present at the \nBolshevik Central Committee session on 29 October; and he and \nG. 10 \nBy then Lenin was feeling less constrained. 13 Trotski resumed the \npolitical offensive in the Bolshevik Central Committee on I \nNovember, opposing the exclusion of Lenin from any coalition. The Bolsheviks, he exclaimed, had not made a \nrevolution merely to negotiate it away. The Central Committee, siding with Lenin, \ncalled for talks to be resumed, but for Bolshevik representatives to \ndeliver the ultimatum that the other parties accept the Bolshevik \nparty line on peace, land, workers' control, food supplies and the \nstruggle with Kaledin and Kerenski. The Decree on the Press led to raids on non-Bolshevik \nnewspapers such as the liberal-owned Rech and even Den, which \nwas run by the right-wing Menshevik (and one-time collaborator of \nLenin's) A. The Mensheviks, under Martov's influence, \ndemanded on 2 November the liberation of all political prisoners \nalong with an end to military actions and to what they referred to as \nthe Bolshevik 'terror'. By ten \nvotes to five, the Bolshevik Central Committee condemned the \n'opposition' within its own midst as being intimidated by the \nbourgeoisie and supported only by 'the tired (and not revolution-\nary) part of the population'. Bolshevik power in Moscow \n The View from Petrograd \n277 \nhad been secured; Vikzhel's authority over its own railwaymen was \nsuccessfully challenged by the creation of a new union under \nBolshevik direction; and food supplies were at last reaching central \nRussia from the Volga.20 The necessity of further pretence, in the \neyes of Lenin and Trotski, had evaporated. Lenin drew up an ultimatum: either they obtained the \nparty's approval to form a coalition government, and Lenin would \nfeel free to campaign against such a government; or else Lenin would \nobtain the party's sanction and the opposition itself would campaign \nagainst Sovnarkom.21 \nNo one with the merest acquaintance with Bolshevik history could \nthink that Lenin was bluffing; he seemed to live by the motto: 'If in \ndoubt, split. They felt that, while Lenin's position had \nstrengthened somewhat, their own was far from being hopeless. An \nalready isolated Bolshevik government was getting ready to isolate \nitself further from several of the most prominent Bolshevik leaders. In total, five out of fifteen People's \nCommissars refused to continue to work in Sovnarkom because of \nopposition to Lenin's and Trotski's intransigence. And there were others \nlike Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, People's Commissar for Labour, who \nagreed not to leave their posts but made public their disgust with the \nrole of Lenin and Trotski in the collapse of coalition talks. 24 \nYet Lenin's nerve held; and Trotski, far from apologising for the \nrestrictions on press freedom, gloried in the arguments for repres-\nsion. 25 Lenin was not so abrasive in public. The Council of \nPeople's Commissars aspired to rule a country with a majority of \npeasants, and it was vital to reassure the peasantry that Bolshevik \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintentions were pure. Mariya Spiridonova and the other Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries could not be treated dismissively, even \nthough they had refused to join the Soviet government at the \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. The Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries themselves were beginning to recognise that \nthe Soviet government might not prove to be so ephemeral as once \nseemed likely. \nConsequently, contacts between Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were never entirely cut. Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies continued to attend the sessions of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, badgering the \nCouncil of People's Commissars with criticisms of its officials' \nconduct. The temptation to \njoin the Bolsheviks in coalition increased. It galled the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries that Lenin and not Spiridonova had signed the \nDecree on Land, which Lenin unembarrassedly admitted was a \ndecree purloined from Socialist Revolutionaries. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries retained an all-\nsocialist coalition as their ideal objective. Left Socialist Revolutionaries tended to lay a \nlesser blame on the Bolsheviks than on the anti-Bolsheviks for the \nbreakdown of talks. They formed their own separate party in \nNovember 1917 and openly opposed Chernov at the Second All-\nRussian Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. With this mandate from peasant Russia in their \npockets, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries felt able to re-enter \nnegotiations with the Bolsheviks. Lenin was a willing interlocutor, \nand on 10 December seven Left Socialist Revolutionaries joined \nSovnarkom as new People's Commissars. Bolsheviks argued that the \nBolshevik party was entitled to this superiority since the Left \n The View from Petrograd \n279 \nSocialist Revolutionaries had delayed their entrance into govern-\nment until the going was safer. 30 \nTHE SPREAD OF SOVIET POWER \nLenin's energies were large but not infinite. They were consumed by \nthe problems of setting up Sovnarkom; of brow-beating his party's \nCentral Committee; of cajoling the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \ninto office; of overseeing the disposition of military and political \nforces in Petrograd to ensure the final removal of Kerenski and his \ndiminishing band of supporters; of writing and elaborating the \nlegislation which poured forth from the government's chaotic offices \nin the Smolny Institute. \nHowever, in November 1917 he had no choice but to entrust \nprovincial contacts to Yakov Sverdlov. Lenin's disrespect for him \nhad long disappeared.32 Lenin, Trotski \nand Sverdlov knew that they barely had the capital under control, \nand that Kerenski's defeat might merely be the prelude to a grimmer \ncivil war. The workers, soldiers and peasants had nothing to fear \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nexcept fear itself: the lower social orders of Russia, he declared, had \nto make their own :evolution. Violent incidents recurred in the capital; and \nadministrative confusion abounded as the new structures of author-\nity were constructed and challenged, sometimes by the Bolsheviks \nthemselves. While being warm \nand inspiring in face-to-face meetings in the Institute, Lenin \ncontinued to write the austere prose of the theorist of socialist \nrevolution. Asked for advice and assistance by the Berdyansk \nBolshevik Committee, he responded: 'You understand, comrade, \nthat it is difficult to give you instructions any more concrete than \n\"All Power To The Soviets\". '35 Local Bolsheviks \nwere simply implored to make their own political arrangements and \nkeep an eye on the central party newspaper for general guidance. The \nCentral Committee was acting in accordance with the stated \nBolshevik philosophy of a dual revolution from above and from \nbelow; but it was equally a reflection of practical possibilities. And \nleast of all did Lenin, the father of Bolshevik centralism, believe in \nprinciple in non-intervention in local affairs. Moscow \nwas a case in point. Not only Moscow but also the town of Vladimir and the \nDonbass region were discussed, but the topics related to nationalisa-\ntion and financial assignations rather than to detailed political \n The View from Petrograd \n281 \nguidance and military support; and it had been local Bolshevik and \nsoviet organs which had put them on to the agenda. 37 \nThe flimsy messages and even flimsier guidance issuing forth from \nSovnarkom and the Bolshevik Central Committee in Petrograd left \nmost soviets to their own devices. The transfer of authority was in \nany case easier in most other cities and towns of central Russia than \nin Moscow.38 Urban soviets in the region either were already under \nBolshevik influence or else had a large and growing contingent of \nBolshevik deputies. Some \nsoviets had for months been in the hands of socialists seeking the \nProvisional Government's overthrow. The Petrograd Soviet, despite \na certain finessing of its relations with Kerenski in order to avoid the \naccusation of overt disobedience, had set such an example. 40 Even in the south-east, \nin the old heartland of the Socialist Revolutionaries by the Volga, the \nBolsheviks and other left-wing socialists secured their successes. In \nTambov it took some days of violence before the transfer of power \nwas effected, but in Nizhni Novgorod, there was little armed \nconflict;41 and the soldiers in the Kazan garrison were so pro-\nBolshevik that other groups in the population offered no resis-\ntance. In Simbirsk, the native town of Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov-\nLenin, fighting broke out but the rapid victory of the pro-Bolshevik \nforces was never in serious doubt. What became known as the triumphal march of \nsoviet power stretched over the last months of 1917 and into 1918. This concern to rouse the local soviets, \ntrade unions and factory-workshop committees to revolutionary \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \naction helps to explain why Lenin, a trained jurist, was vague to the \npoint of remissness in framing the legislation.44 \nLenin was accustomed to explaining party policies in greater detail \nthrough the Bolshevik press, but this was no longer physically \npossible for an overworked politician. He published just one brief \nletter in the central party newspaper in November and December \n1917. A \nlarge influx of party activists from the provinces could only have \nmeant that the Bolsheviks were being forced to flee. And, when \nreportage on local developments reached Petrograd (and it must be \nborne in mind that Sverdlov was meeting more people),47 Sovnarkom \nand the Bolshevik Central Committee were confirmed in their \noptimism. He \nknew that, unless the villages sided with or at least failed to oppose \nthe Bolsheviks, all the political progress in the towns might be \nreversed. Bolshevik party \nactivists had won notable victories in elections to soldiers' commit-\ntees on the northern sector of the Eastern front in the autumn; and \nthe transfer of power in Petrograd left few generals with the illusion \nthat the moment was yet propitious for a counter-revolutionary \nstrike at Sovnarkom. Despite Bolshevik fears, there was a widespread \ndistaste in the officer corps at all levels for intervening in politics. And yet the chances of \nmobilising regiments against the Bolsheviks were as slim as in the \nnorth. Many \ncarried with them the first information that an October Revolution \nhad occurred and that a leader called Lenin had issued a Decree on \nLand. Lenin lent his support in the \nSmolny Institute, listening to peasant complaints and encouraging \nthem to push forward with revolutionary measures. 5\u00b0 But the process \nalso had its own dynamic; peasant soviets were increasingly being set \nup in Russia in late 1917.52 From the \nBolshevik party's viewpoint, it was irritating that communes became \nso important. Lenin had made his name as an economist in the 1890s \nby trying to demonstrate that the communal arrangements of the \nRussian peasantry were a vehicle of rural capitalism. \nSECESSION AND FEDERATION \nThe Bolsheviks could not afford to be satisfied with their successes in \nthe Russian heartland, and aspired to spreading 'soviet power' to the \nnon-Russian segments of the old empire; and Lenin was especially \nkeen to embark upon a process of what we nowadays would call 'de-\ncolonisation'. The 'nationalities' were to be courted, \nRussian chauvinism disavowed. The appeal issued to \n'workers, soldiers and peasants' from the Second Congress of Soviets \non 25 October offered a guarantee of 'the authentic right of self-\ndetermination to all nations inhabiting Russia'. In the meantime, on 2 \nNovember, a Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia \nwas accepted by Sovnarkom and issued next day under the signature \nof Stalin and Lenin; it called for 'a voluntary and honourable union of \nthe peoples of Russia', abolishing all previous national privileges and \nother discriminations and confirming the right of each nation to \nsecession. Much heat had disappeared from intra-\nBolshevik discussions about the non-Russian nationalities by \nsummer 1917,57 and Lenin acted with a stealthy purposiveness. Lenin hoped \nthat Finnish independence would be secured by a revolutionary \nsocialist administration of Finns. Lenin's letters to Finnish social-democrats before the \nOctober Revolution reveal how badly he misjudged the socialists of \nFinland even though he had spent the summer among them. Offers of direct military assistance from \nthe Bolshevik commanders of the Russian naval garrisons in Finland \ndid not dispel Wiik's caution. and his colleagues organised a \ngeneral strike in Finland's cities; but they resisted the Bolshevik plea \nto make a revolution because they neither wanted civil war nor were \nconvinced that the Soviet government would long survive in \nRussia. The \nBolsheviks made clear that they would grant independence even to \nSvinhufvud's cabinet.62 \nThe fiasco of forcing independence down the throats of Finnish \npoliticians proved that those contemporaries who felt that Lenin had \nno ideological beliefs and was exclusively an unprincipled power-\nseeker had misunderstood him. Nevertheless, those \nBolsheviks who had argued against Lenin's line on secession were \nbuoyed up by the fiasco. \n 286 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe only other subject nation to be guaranteed sovereignty over its \naffairs was Poland. And yet this also \nmade it easier for the Bolshevik negotiators to gain support \nthroughout the party for the tactic of embarrassing the German \nand Austrian delegations at the peace talks in Brest-Litovsk by \naffirming the need for all peoples to be accorded the right of national \nself-determination.65 Neither Finland nor \nPoland were crucial to Russia's internal economic and political well-\nbeing in 1917, but the same was not true of the Ukraine. Lenin and \nStalin continued to goad the Finnish social-democrats into a seizure \nof power after December. They began carefully, relying both \non the attractiveness of their Decrees on Peace and on Land, and on \nthe ability of Ukrainian Bolsheviks to seize power for the soviets in \nKiev, Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav. No Bolshevik leader yet approved \nthe principles of federalism. 66 \nThe Bolsheviks in Kiev avoided a clash with the Rada, but \nprepared for the forthcoming Congress of Soviets in the Ukraine. \nBut the Rada steadfastly opposed Sovnarkom and linked up with the \nanti-Bolshevik force among the Don Cossacks. A clash in Kiev was \ninevitable, especially after the arrest of Bolshevik leaders in Kiev in \nlate November. A \ndifficulty for the Bolsheviks was that the Ukrainian Congress of \nSoviets in Kiev found them in a minority. 69 The Bolsheviks \nadjourned to Kharkov, held their own rival Congress of Soviets \nand - guided now by their left-wing leaders- moved to seize power in \nall major cities. Federation, previously a word \nspat out even by Lenin (who was the Bolshevik leader favouring the \ngentlest treatment of the national question), became part of current \nparlance. On 3 December Lenin had drafted a 'Manifesto to the \nUkrainian People', published in Pravda two days later, which \nannounced the hope that a federal agreement could be worked out \nbetween Russia and the Ukraine.71 The Ukrainian Bolshevik leftists, \nwho regarded such suggestions as an undesirable concession to \nnationalism, were displeased. 72 But they needed Petrograd's support \nand succumbed to Lenin's pressure; and the knowledge of their \nelectoral weakness in the Ukraine dissuaded them from disobedience \nto the Bolshevik Central Committee. \nNone the less, a sea-change in Lenin's attitude had occurred. Nor did \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBukharin and the Bolshevik left have a practical alternative. But inaction had \nnever been a Bolshevik virtue; and Lenin skilfully advocated a \npractical plan which at least had the merit, in the eyes of Bolshevik \nleftists, of seeking the retention of a multinational state. Bolsheviks came to power in Baku, in \nAzerbaidzhan (as it was coming to be called); but the local Moslem \nparties and influences grew in the surrounding countryside: the \nchances of an anti-Russian alliance was growing. In Armenia, the \nzeal to break with Russia was weaker; but the Bolsheviks held little \ninfluence and would have only weakened their position if concessions \nto national feeling had not been forthcoming. In Siberia, the Socialist \nRevolutionaries were attempting to set up an autonomous state \nadministration. 76 \nThe national surge among Estonians and Latvians was linked to \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in Russia. The \nCongress of Soviets in Latvia, which was already under partial \noccupation by the Germans, did the same in mid-December 1917. The Romanov lands were not seething with anti-Russianism. Yet nationalist feelings were \nundeniably growing in fervour; and the signs were few that a robust \npro-Sovietism pervaded the non-Russian regions. 78 \nPOLITICAL REPRESSION \nSovnarkom's main worries of the moment were concentrated on \nRussia. In the last \ntwo months of 1917, Spiridonova's comrades were the only party \nwhich did not suffer directly at the hands of the Bolsheviks. Attentive \nobservers of Lenin before the October Revolution can hardly have \nbeen surprised. He had \nurged the need for a system of civil rights and judicial procedures \nwhich expressly discriminated against the bourgeoisie; and he had \ndescribed all parties to the right of the Bolsheviks as mere \nappendages of the Kadets and their pro-bourgeois interests.79 \nBut it was only after the October Revolution that most people who \nsupported the Bolsheviks became fully aware of his ferocity. Lenin \nhad hitherto adjusted his rhetoric in order to allay any feelings that a \ngovernment under his leadership would produ\u2022.80 Viktor Nogin, on \nresigning his post as People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, \npredicted that the Soviet government would steadily move towards \ntt::rrorist techniques if the Bolsheviks refused to form a broad socialist \ncoalition.81 Yet there was no Bolshevik anathema on the application \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof mass terror. On the contrary, Lenin approved its use by the \nJacobins in the French Revolution; and, at the Third Party Congress \nin 1905, the Bolsheviks displayed a willingness to resort to it in \nRussia if the need appeared to arise.82 Lenin's approval of mass \nterror was accompanied by a rejection of the populist-terrorist tactic \nof assassinations of individual state officials as a means of bringing \nabout a crisis of the Romanov state.84 There is no firm evidence available that Lenin and colleagues \nsuch as Trotski were hell-bent, before the October Revolution, on \ninstigating a campaign of summary arrest and execution of large \nnumbers of people who had committed no crime but who happened \nto belong to a social category deemed politically inimical to the \nregime. Lenin made threats on political opponents quickly after the \nseizure of power.'85 \nSystematic summary repression which did not go as far as gross \nphysical maltreatment or capital punishment occurred with not only \nthe sanction but even the straightforward encouragement of the \ncentral Soviet authorities in the first month of Soviet power, and \nseveral weeks before the establishment of the All-Russian Extra-\nordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Specula-\ntion and Sabotage (or, as it appears in its Russian acronym: the \nCheka), which is rightly regarded as the forerunner of today's KGB. \nSuch repression was undertaken by organs which, at Lenin's \ndirection, were kept deliberately unaccountable for their actions. \nThe facility of Lenin's resort to terror raises a question about the \nsincerity of his pre-October statements. It is also true that the \nscale of terror was raised only gradually by Lenin. \nSeveral Bolshevik leaders expected that the People's Commissar-\niats of Internal Affairs and of Justice would preside over law and \norder, but Lenin had other ideas. (It \nwas no accident that the Committee contained several Bolsheviks, \nincluding Felix Dzierzynski, who were to lead the Cheka). At a \nSovnarkom session under Lenin's chairmanship on 15 November, a \ndecision was taken to transfer various matters from the People's \nCommissariat of Internal Affairs to the Military-Revolutionary \nCommittee. Lenin encouraged them and protected them against \ncomplaints. 87 \nAdmittedly, the Bolshevik Central Committee and Sovnarkom \nwere not hallucinating when they talked of enemies who planned or \ncould reasonably be expected to plan armed opposition towards the \nBolsheviks. The Bolsheviks had seized power; they could scarcely \nanticipate a pat on the back from their foes. There is a 'road to \nDublin' aspect to this argument; for no one had forced Lenin and \nTrotski to grasp power in the way they did: they could hardly \ndemand sympathy for their subsequent dilemmas. Even so, Lenin left \nnothing to chance. Closures of non-Bolshevik newspapers continued. \nCriticisms were directed at the Decree on the Pr~ss - or 'Lenin's \ndecree', as it was sometimes called - in the Central Executive \n 292 \nLenin: A Political Life \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets. Lenin brushed them casually \naside. Yet \nit was military opposition which caused the Bolsheviks the greatest \nanxiety. \nIts members included not only liberals but also several Mensheviks \nand Socialist Revolutionaries; all of them sought the forcible \noverthrow of Bolshevism.92 But by 28 November this inhibition had \ndisappeared: Lenin signed a Sovnarkom announcement that all \nmembers of the Kadet party, regardless of their opinions and \nactivity as individuals, were to be treated as 'enemies of the people' \nand placed outside the law. When other leading Bolsheviks sought to \nrestrain Dzierzynski, Lenin freed him to follow his repressive \ninstincts. \nGERMANY AND THE ALLIES \nThe messages issuing from Sovnarkom and its chairman continued to \nbe euphoric, and the elevated mood persisted even while the lurch \ndown into repressive measures steepened; there were few Bolsheviks \nremaining inside the party who did not have highly unrealistic \nnotions about what could be accomplished in the Russia of 1917. \nYet Lenin, too, was pondering the excessive optimism of the \nBolshevik left with growing agitation; he was relieved, in early \nDecember, when Zinoviev resumed his Central Committee seat. Lenin had never claimed that a German \nsocialist revolution was certain to occur literally on the morrow of \nthe Russian socialist revolution.97 Dukhonin procrastinated and was replaced by \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Bolshevik N. 101 \nThe Allied governments perceived that unofficial contact with \nSovnarkom was vital to inhibit Russia's complete disengagement \nfrom the War. Trotski met with their various representatives in \nPetrograd 102 Lenin, either because of preoccupation with domestic \naffairs or else because he wished others to be tainted with \ninvolvement in such unpleasant duties, held himself aloof. Trotski was already \npondering aloud whether the Russians could carry on fighting if \nGermany failed to have its expected socialist revolution. 103 Lenin, mean-\nwhile, persisted in his silence about revolutionary war. 104 He and \nTrotski at least agreed that, for the moment, the talks with the \nCentral Powers at Brest-Litovsk should be used as an instrument for \nspreading Soviet propaganda to the workers and soldiers of \nGermany. The ingenuity of the new diplomacy of the Bolsheviks \nwas countered by the subtlety of the German and Austrian \nnegotiators. Far from being embarrassed by the Soviet demand for \n'national self-determination' as the principle to underlie any general \npeace in Europe, German Foreign Secretary Ricard von Kuhlmann \nemployed it to undermine the Bolsheviks' pretensions to sovereignty \n The View from Petrograd \n295 \nover most of the old Russian empire. Consultations of popular \nopinion in the Ukraine and in regions of the Baltic provinces and the \nTranscaucasus would predictably fail to produce pro-Bolshevik \nmajorities. Joffe, who resembled Trotski \ninasmuch as he was a left-wing Marxist who had joined the \nBolshevik party only in 1917. 106 \nLenin entered a trough of agitation. The Bolshevik \npeace policy called on soldiers to help to end the war by fraternising \nwith German soldiers and spreading the revolutionary contagion to \nthe enemy armed forces; but Russian peasants-in-uniform preferred \nsimply to desert. Soon, not only revolutionary enthusiasm among the \nRussian soldiers would be lacking, but the Russian soldiers too. 107 On 18 December, Lenin came to Sovnark-\nom with a motion stressing the need to prepare Petrograd's \ndefences. The response of \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe delegates confirmed Lenin's fears, and indeed suggested that he \nmight not be pessimistic enough. Unlike Trotski, he had never made a point of stressing that the \nRussian socialist revolution would be lost if socialist revolutions \nfailed to break out in central and western Europe. But he shared the \nassumption that, without revolutions in other major European states, \nRussia's revolutionary project would be crippled. 112 So Lenin's \nmental shift was not lightly undertaken. There is an unknown factor here: the extent \nof political contacts and 'understandings', if any, between Lenin and \nthe Berlin government. The Germans had had an interest in helping \nthe Bolsheviks to take power, and rejoiced in the news of the October \nRevolution. But whether the Berlin government stretched out a \nhelping hand to Lenin in the last two months of 1917 is undiscover-\nable from available documents (although the German diplomats at \nBrest-Litovsk acted as if they were offering little concession, \nmonetary or political, to the Bolsheviks). 114 Yet Lenin also wished to plan carefully for the contingency \nthat such a revolution would not come to Sovnarkom's rescue and \nthat a separate peace might prove necessary. Bolshevik leaders, while \nshowing an awareness in summer 1917 of the difficulties of fighting a \nrevolutionary war, had never suggested that the alternative option, \nnamely a separate peace, was acceptable. 115 They had always \nbelieved that, if it came to a choice between a separate peace and a \nwar of revolutionary defence, no Bolshevik should sign a treaty with \nthe Germans. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to a man and \nwoman, were implacably opposed to a separate peace. If Lenin was going to change his party's policy, the \npolitical campaign would make the struggle for The April Theses \n The View from Petrograd \n297 \nseem child's play. 116 No date for a reply from Petrograd \nwas set, but Lenin foresaw that Trotski's delaying tactics might soon \nprove insufficient. On 24 December 1917, Lenin set out for a few \ndays' rest in a sanatorium near the Usikirkka village railway \nstation. He was plotting how to present \nhis volte-face on the idea of a separate peace to his fellow Bolsheviks. 119 Trotski firmly opposed such a \nreorientation and secured Lenin's continued support for his pro-\ncrastinatory tactics with the delegations of Germany and Austria-\nHungary at Brest-Litovsk. But Trotski \nfelt that the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries had no \noption but to prolong the talks and call the bluff of the Central \nPowers, hoping against hope that the German workers would rise \nagainst the Kaiser or that a debilitating mutiny would occur among \nthe German forces on active service; and, for the moment, it was \nTrotski's policy which guided the Soviet negotiators. Lenin, with \ndifficulty, bided his time. He had yet to make his decisive impact on \nthe issue that had played so great a role in the Bolshevik advance on \npower: the issue of war and peace. \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDARKENING THOUGHTS \nIntimidating developments at Brest-Litovsk did not dispel the \noptimism of the Bolshevik leaders in either Petrograd or the \nprovinces. Lenin continued to call for working-class initiative, to \nwelcome factory workers in person to the Smolny Institute and to \nproclaim the ultimate objectives of communism. His domestic \npolitical strategy in 1917, before the seizure of power, had been a \ncombination of the revolution from above with the revolution from \nbelow. \nStrongly-held doctrines were not peculiar to the Bolsheviks among \nRussian political parties in the revolutionary period. The question has been asked why \nLenin failed to make a more realistic assessment of his party's \ncapacities in the first months after the October Revolution. Why did Lenin not attempt this in \nthe winter of 1917-18. Would not the pressures for the Bolsheviks \nto become more authoritarian have been smaller. Lenin and Sovnarkom could scarcely \nforego a large proportion of the tradeable grain surplus in the \ncircumstances. 121 \nYet the Bolsheviks did not entertain a second thought (or even a \nfirst one) about introducing greater latitude for trading on the \nprivate market. The central party leadership was a collective of \nMarxist believers. Moreover, a 'capitalist \ngovernment' had set up the state grain-trade monopoly before the \nBolsheviks seized power. The Bolsheviks, as far-left socialists, were \nhighly unlikely to regard a relaxation of controls on capitalism as \nan immediately desirable priority. 122 \nIn addition, Lenin was an extremist by the standards of most non-\nBolshevik Russian socialists, but his policies on several socio-\neconomic issues remained decidedly moderate in comparison with \nthose of many colleagues. Osinski and other \nBolshevik leftists were elaborating an agrarian policy involving the \nrapid collectivisation of peasant households. 123 Poor Lenin. He it \nhad been in the 1890s who had urged upon Russian Marxists that \ncapitalism in the countryside had achieved a high level of develop-\nment. Left-wing Bolsheviks concluded that this justified the transfer \nof all agricultural soil into the hands of socialist collective farms run \nby agronomists and wage labourers, and they pushed hard for the \nlocal party committees to adopt their policy. 124 Pity for Lenin is, \nconsequently, scarcely in order. Even in The April Theses he had \nfudged the topic of 'model farms' and allowed Bolsheviks on the left \nto think that he and they were at one about agrarian policy. 127 \nThe hypothesis that Lenin had sufficient authority to introduce the \nideas of 1921 in 1917 badly misconstrues the ideological nature of \nBolshevism after the October Revolution; it also neglects the party's \norganisational disjointedness and localism. 128 \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe revolutionary elan persisted. The Saratov City Soviet, \nhaving replaced the agencies of the Provisional. Bolsheviks everywhere swept into the \nsoviets, trade unions and factory-workshop committees; the purely \ninternal work of the party was neglected. Hierarchical obedience in \npublic institutions was rare; the administrative framework of the \nsoviets was poorly co-ordinated. But the trend was as yet frail; and the centralism \nadvocated by all leading Bolsheviks, including the leftists who \nsimultaneously and contradictorily wanted to grant maximum \npower to factory-workshop committees, was not accepted in \npractice. Kamenev, Zinoviev, \nMilyutin and other Bolshevik rightists had warned about the dangers \nof aggravating them; and Lenin, who had scoffed at the rightists' \nwarnings in October 1917, began to share their sentiments. On 4 \nNovember 1917 he announced to the Petrograd Soviet: 'Our \ndeficiency consists in the fact that our soviet organisation has not \nyet learnt to administer, that we hold too many meetings. He also objected to the internal inefficiencies \nof the soviets and the other public organisations. 135 \nHe had believed, before 1917, that the techniques of 'bourgeois \nculture' should be retained in the socialist revolution; his opposition \nto Bogdanov's dismissive attitude and to vague talk about 'proletar-\nian culture' had been deep. 138 Even more impressive are the \nneglected shifts in Lenin's attitude to the working class. The fact that the print-workers were interested in the \nprotection of freedom of expression for non-Bolshevik political \nparties was a strange ground for dubbing them hooligans, but Lenin \nrampantly expanded the category of imprisonable people. These he \ndesignated as 'privileged workers' who were exercised only by their \nsectional interests (which, presumably, involved a continuation of the \nwar and therefore were counterposed to Lenin's policy for a separate \npeace). It had \nroots in his horrified and belated recognition of the dimensions and \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnature of the economic crisis; it was also traceable to the subordinate \nrole he had always placed on the workers as a social class whenever \nthey acted at variance with his policies. Bolsheviks, he declared, \nshould seek 'to help the labouring peasant, avoid offending the \nmiddle peasant and compel the rich peasant'. Thus Lenin \nmade a quick return to the themes of class war and of the attack on \nthe richer peasants.

He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution.

The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nAdmittedly, the Socialist Revolutionaries' triumph was not evenly-\ndistributed across the country. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. And only 39 Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere elected to the Constituent Assembly. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. Lenin and his \nassociates also complained that the lists of electoral candidates had \nbeen drawn up before the split in the Party of Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries. The consequence was an under-representation of the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries at the Assembly, since the electorate was \nwidely unable to vote specifically for them or even to know who they \nwere. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries, despite having won the Assembly elections, was \nriven by internal disputes. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. Lenin recognised that \ncaution had to be exercised with regard to his own party members \n(who were not universally in favour of the Assembly's suppression), \nto some among his Left Socialist Revolutionary allies and to a \ngeneral population which might not take kindly to the infringement \nof its newly-obtained democratic rights. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. 22 A demonstration held by supporters \nof the Assembly, who naively supposed that the Bolsheviks would \nnot use force upon fellow socialists, was fired upon. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out. Lenin chirpily intervened to propose the singing of the \n'lnternationale'; and it is a sign of the disorientation of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries that they accepted his proposal instead of pressing \non with substantive matters of state. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. The Socialist Revolu-\ntionary agenda was accepted by a vote on the floor, and the \nBolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries walked out in \nprotest. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. Lenin could at last relax. \nMany Socialist Revolutionaries were to fight against the Reds, not \nbecause they shared the aims of generals from the old imperial \nregiments but in pursuit of rectifying the great wrong done to their \nparty at the Tauride Palace. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. The numerical weakness of Left Socialist Revolutionar-\nies at the Assembly meant that they were even less disposed to mourn \nits passing; and many were like P. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. As soon as \nhe had achieved his objective, he turned calmly to deal with the \nalliance with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition. In \nfact, the division between Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries had become so deep that two fully separate \nCongresses of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies were held simultan-\neously. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. At the same \ntime, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were not going to be \naccorded any greater number of seats in Sovnarkom itself than \nbefore. The Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were as naive about the Bolshevik central leader-\nship's ruthlessness as the Socialist Revolutionaries had been about \nLenin's disregard for the rights of the Constituent Assembly; but at \n The Obscene Peace \n311 \nthe time they thought the deal worth making since the Bolsheviks \nwere willing to offer them compromises on the single act of \nlegislation, then under preparation, that most interested them: the \nBasic Land Law. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty. 36 Lenin had imbibed enough \nof the revolutionary spirit to allow fellow People's Commissars to \nraise subjects not previously tabled for discussion,37 but his instinct \nwas to reinforce order and orderliness. Trotski and Stalin were invaluable collaborators, and \nthe skills of the Bolshevik ex-undergrounders at central and local \nlevels of government ought not to be forgotten. Of the other prominent Bolsheviks, both \nZinoviev and Kamenev had compromised themselves by their so-\ncalled 'strike-breaking' in October 1917; and younger leaders such as \nBukharin and Pyatakov, who were taken seriously by Lenin before \n1917 and who were to figure in his 'testament' of 1922, lacked \nLenin's prestige and authority.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries were nervous about peasant feelings \nand on 6 December the new tax law was amended to allow local \nsoviets to exempt the poorer sections of the population from all \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntaxation. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries also successfully \nstipulated that the peasants should receive land according to the \nnumber of mouths to feed in each household.51 Lenin had always hoped to keep the middle \npeasants, who had suddenly become an overwhelming majority, on \nthe party's side. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. \nTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN DISPUTE \nLenin's restlessness with Trotski's tactic of 'neither war nor peace' \ngrew sharply in 1918. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee.86 Lenin was obviously not the only Bolshevik leader who \ncould point to another Bolshevik leader's past failings. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.89 The vote in favour of \nprocrastinating and hoping for the outbreak of a German socialist \nrevolution was passed by twelve against one.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened. Yet signs appeared that Lenin was gaining ground: five \nparticipants now voted in favour of a separate peace.95 Their anti-Lenin \narguments were not as unequivocal as they might have been. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. 102 Trotski was now \non Lenin's side. [Lenin]. 108 The left-wingers under Bukharin collectively resigned from \ntheir posts in government and party. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. Naturally this \npushed leading Bolsheviks back into the central body where they \ncould resolve their own disagreements on policy definitively and \nwithout interference from other parties. 113 In addition, the leftists had \nnobody of his stature as a dominant revolutionary figure. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. But his international policy of 1918 came \nout well in comparison with the suggestions of his Left Communist \nopponents. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. 116 Organisational manipulation was not the only reason for the \nadvance of the Leninists before the Party Congress. 126 The sheer impracticality of the Left Communists, \nas they were becoming known, played into Lenin's hands. Left Communists \nwere essentially volunteer military commanders without military \nexperience and, worse still, without soldiers. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. Their commitment to intra-\nparty democracy was no firmer than Lenin's. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. Bolshevik leftists were like the Polish noblemen of \nformer times who died in a beautiful pose, saying: 'Peace is a \ndisgrace, war is honour. There had always \nbeen dangers in the life of an underground revolutionary, but \nCongresses before 1917 had neither increased nor diminished these \ndangers through their decisions.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. 147 But the Left Communists were \nhopelessly divided. He \ndenied that he thought the German socialist revolution would break \nout within a day or two. 149 He could easily have mentioned that it \nhad been Lenin, not Radek, who had claimed that a mere change of \nparty leadership in Germany could have brought the workers on to \nthe streets for revolutionary action. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. 157 Several speakers followed, including the \nprominent leftists N. Shumailov, \nboth leftists, stuck to their mandates. The motion called for 'the most energetic, \nmercilessly decisive and draconian measures to raise the self-\ndiscipline and discipline of the workers and peasants of Russia'; it \ndeclared that 'a liberationist, patriotic socialist war' was unavoidable, \nand that universal military training should be put in hand. These leftists had \nwanted to scrap all vestiges of the reform proposals in the existing \nparty programme on the grounds that they had been formulated in \n1903 with a future bourgeois revolution rather than a socialist \nrevolution in mind. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. The Congress presidium proposed a list \nincluding some leftists. Lenin pleaded with the leftists, \narguing that diversity of opinions was good for the Central \nCommittee. Lenin and Trotski, with thirty-four votes, had \nmost support. His triumph at the Party Congress had \ndamaged relations with the Left Communists, and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were destined to leave Sovnarkom. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. \nAnd in south-eastern Russia, the Socialist Revolutionaries were \nmustering to establish an alternative Russian government consisting \n The Obscene Peace \n333 \nof deputies from the dispersed Constituent Assembly. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. Before the February Revolution, he had been a \nfactionalist and a theorist. He sought \ninfluence among Marxists. Outside the \nfaction, furthermore, he remained a deliberately disruptive politician \n(as socialist leaders in the rest of Europe noted with displeasure). Thus \nthe Okhrana, by arresting revolutionaries and severely constricting \nthe freedoms of the illegal labour movement, made a Lenin possible. \nAnd so he survived, acquiring the prestige of a veteran and a major \nthinker among Bolsheviks. His \nMarxism evinced a fanaticism which was common in varying degrees \namong Bolsheviks - and it was alloyed with non-Marxist doctrines \nand impulses which he did not acknowledge. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. He managed, too, to appeal at last both to sophisticated far-\nleft socialist intellectuals and to ordinary factory workers. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. The chances of the prolonged survival of such a regime, \nlinking Bolsheviks with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, \nhad never been large; but Lenin was prominent in preventing the \nattempt from being made. He brushed aside all criticism with the \ndeclaration that the policies of the Mensheviks and the Socialist \nRevolutionaries had had their opportunity in government before the \nOctober Revolution, and they had failed. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world.", "Breathing_Space_1917": " 142 It was highly unlikely, in \nBukharin's estimation, that the breathing space would be sufficient \nto facilitate economic reconstruction and military preparedness.", "Breathing_Space_1918": "", "Party_Committees_1917": " The Constituent \nAssembly results began to become available in late November. Only in the \npre-October months of 1917 had he ever spoken warmly about a \nConstituent Assembly; and even then it was mainly with the purpose \nof undermining public confidence in the Provisional Government's \nwill to convoke the Assembly. His manipulativeness and \nlack of public candour was so extreme that, while the Second \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was in \nsession, he implored his Bolshevik Central Committee colleagues to \nannounce a postponement of the Constituent Assembly elections.4 \nThis was a natural corollary of his admission to the Central \nCommittee on 10 October that the Constituent Assembly would \nnot side with the Bolsheviks. Data are available for 703 Assembly \ndeputies, 380 of which, a clear majority, were Socialist Revolutionar-\nies. And only 39 Left Socialist Revolutionaries \nwere elected to the Constituent Assembly. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. Lenin and his \nassociates also complained that the lists of electoral candidates had \nbeen drawn up before the split in the Party of Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries. The consequence was an under-representation of the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries at the Assembly, since the electorate was \nwidely unable to vote specifically for them or even to know who they \nwere. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the Party of Socialist \nRevolutionaries, despite having won the Assembly elections, was \nriven by internal disputes. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. On 21 November 1917, it was decreed that all consti-\ntuencies should have the right to recall and replace their Assembly \ndeputies. On 3 \nJanuary 1918 the announcement was made on Sovnarkom's behalf \nthat the Constituent Assembly would be acceptable only if it \nsupported 'soviet power'. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. 22 A demonstration held by supporters \nof the Assembly, who naively supposed that the Bolsheviks would \nnot use force upon fellow socialists, was fired upon.27 A forlorn group of anti-Bolshevik Constituent \nAssembly delegates left the Palace, never to return. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders.31 \nThe Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies had been arranged to start in the second \nweek of January so that pressure might be exerted upon the \nConstituent Assembly should it remain in session. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. At the same \ntime, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were not going to be \naccorded any greater number of seats in Sovnarkom itself than \nbefore. 39 \nIn the intervals between Bolshevik Central Committee meetings,40 \nSovnarkom was the major centre of power in the country. Stalin's abrasiveness was to become an issue of intra-party \nsignificance in 1919. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Sovnarkom encouraged demobilisation of several \nregiments in late 1917. The pre-October commitment to demilitaris-\ning industrial production and switching to output for the civilian \nmarket was also being fulfilled; and Sverdlov engineered the closure \nof Bolshevik party committees in the Russian army on the Eastern \nfront. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.69 Yet the rights of \nfactory-workshop committees were vigorously trimmed. The terms offered to the Soviet delegation by \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, especially the proposal that the \narmies of the Central Powers would maintain their occupation in \nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic region, had provoked a furious \nreaction in the local committees of the Bolshevik party.77 \nOn 8 January, Lenin could ascertain the strength of the internal \nparty opposition when he addressed sixty three leaders of the \nBolshevik fraction to the Third Congress of Soviets of Workers', \nSoldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened.92 \nConferences, being less authoritative bodies than Congresses, accord-\ning to the party's traditions, could be called more quickly; and since \nthe left already held so many local committees it would be easy to \ndefeat Lenin. Therefore Zinoviev called instead for a full Party \nCongress, which ought to involve the open election of delegates at \nmass meetings.93 But the left managed \nto obtain a Central Committee session with local representatives on 3 \nFebruary, and again the policy of dragging out the negotiations was \napproved. The Central Committee met, with Trotski in attendance, on 17 \nFebruary. 98 Lenin had come within inches of political victory in \nthe Central Committee. Lenin had \nachieved his long-pursued majority in the Central Committee. 105 Lenin was horrified and threatened to \nleave Sovnarkom and the Central Committee: 'These terms must be \nsigned. 109 Yet Lenin's victory was \ncomplete in the Central Committee. \nPARTY POLEMICIST \nVital as it was to control the Central Committee, however, Lenin did \nnot yet control the entire political system: the various organs of \npower were rivals to each other. 116 Organisational manipulation was not the only reason for the \nadvance of the Leninists before the Party Congress. Another was the \nseries of speeches given by Central Committee supporters in the rest \nof the country. 124 Few critics, after \nthe early tirades in the privacy of the Central Committee in January, \ncastigated Lenin personally. It is true that, by the \nend of February, many regional and province-level party committees \n- perhaps even a majority - held fast in opposition to the peace \n 326 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntreaty. 130 But the frequency of conferences at the local level had \ndeclined in recent months; and quite possibly the Left Commmunists \nhad been reluctant to hold elections in the party for fear of losing \ntheir numerically predominant position. \nTHE SEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Seventh Party Congress met in Petrograd's Tauride Palace from \n6-8 March 1918. Petrograd was chosen for the \nParty Congress so as to affirm that the Central Committee's mood \nwas neither downcast nor defeatist. 132 At \nthe opening session there was no time to do more than listen to \nSverdlov's organisational report on the Central Committee. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. Lenin \ngave a joint report on two further issues: the revision of the party \nprogramme and the change of the party's name. These leftists had \nwanted to scrap all vestiges of the reform proposals in the existing \nparty programme on the grounds that they had been formulated in \n1903 with a future bourgeois revolution rather than a socialist \nrevolution in mind. 178 When debate shifted to the \nquestion of the party's name, however, Bukharin spoke strongly on \nLenin's side; and the Congress voted to redesignate the party as the \n 332 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in order to distinguish it \nfrom other Marxist parties in Russia and elsewhere. 179 The Congress \nset up a seven-person commission to compose the party programme \ndefinitively. 180 \nThe collaborative atmosphere was dispelled by the elections to the \nCentral Committee. The Congress presidium proposed a list \nincluding some leftists. Uritski announced that the leftists \nwould not join the Central Committee. Reluctantly they \nagreed to vote in the election of the Central Committee, but declined \nto accept membership. 183 His objection to joining the \nCentral Committee was the sole matter at the Seventh Party \nCongress where victory failed to go to Lenin. His triumph at the Party Congress had \ndamaged relations with the Left Communists, and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were destined to leave Sovnarkom.", "Bolshevik_Hegemony_1917": " It has been tempting \nto treat the Russian revolutionary events as if they were entirely \nindependent of the situation in the rest of the world and as if Russia, \nwhile having an impact on other countries, did not in her turn \nregister their impact. The Soviet state was created in the midst of the First World \nWar, and Russia and her empire had been a major combatant power \nfrom its beginning. The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. As night \nfollows day, it was certain that Russian withdrawal from the conflict \nwould attract unpleasant consequences from abroad. Germany's rulers, never having been distinguished \nfor their international altruism, would predictably exploit the \nweakness of Russian defences to the utmost. If revolutions failed \nto occur in Europe, the chances of Sovnarkom's survival were \nintimately linked to the question of whether any foreign capitalist \npower had the resources and opportunity to intervene militarily in \nRussia. No Russian army in 1917-18 could have repelled the armed \nmight of either the Germans or the Allies if such might had been \nturned on them in concerted fashion. \nThus the absence of revolutionary explosions in Europe, as Lenin \nwas to concede, 1 meant that his regime's fortunes depended \nultimately on a factor beyond its control: the continued mutual \nexhaustion of the Central Powers and the Allies in the War. \nThe victorious progress of Bolshevism before October 1917 could \nnot permanently obscure these supreme military issues. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nLenin's name had been on several successful lists put forward by \nthe Bolsheviks; and, in accordance with the then current system of \nproportional representation, he chose to be returned as one of the \ndeputies for the Baltic fleet.4 \nThis was a natural corollary of his admission to the Central \nCommittee on 10 October that the Constituent Assembly would \nnot side with the Bolsheviks. Only 168, or 22 per cent, were Bolsheviks; they had suffered a \nmassive defeat. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary.8 And yet no Bolshevik before October is recorded as \nhaving anticipated the scale of the actual defeat. \nBolshevik spokesmen argued that the Assembly arrangements had \nbeen unfair to them. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. On 12 \nDecember, Lenin successfully called for the reselection of the Bureau \nof the Bolshevik fraction in the Assembly on the grounds that a \nsterner attitude towards the Assembly was appropriate: nothing was \nbeing left to chance. He also met with Bolshevik leaders who had \nreturned from the Ukraine; 14 he spoke on the phone with the \nAmerican Ambassador in Petrograd. 18 Yet Lenin refused \nto be deflected from his tasks. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out.24 (It was also a very rare \nexample of Lenin using quasi-humorous behaviour to achieve a \npolitical end. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. By late evening he was \nreading out the details of legislation that he now perceived the \nBolsheviks would stop him implementing.25 \nMeanwhile Lenin, conferring with the Bolshevik fraction, decided \nthat there should be no second session of the Assembly.26 Orders \nwere issued forbidding the Palace guard to attack the opponents of \nSovnarkom as they left the building; earlier in the day a Bolshevik \nsupporter had pointed his rifle at the unfortunate Shvetsov as he was \nspeaking.27 A forlorn group of anti-Bolshevik Constituent \nAssembly delegates left the Palace, never to return. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. Lenin could at last relax. Bonch-Bruevich later \nrecalled: 'Lenin was agitated and was paler than ever before . Perhaps he was getting his own back for the \nderision he had suffered at their hands when, at the First Congress of \nSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in June 1917, he had \nexclaimed that his party was willing to rule Russia alone. Lenin's self-\nrestraint could not disguise the momentousness of the occasion. With \nor without Lenin's actions, there would probably have been civil war \nin Russia after the Provisional Government's demise. But the \ndestruction of the Constituent Assembly, which was ratified by a \ndecree of Sovnarkom on 6 January, ensured that the anti-Bolshevik \narmies would be stronger than they might otherwise have been. The Bolsheviks had talked increasingly \nabout civil war since coming to power, but they claimed that it was \nthe Kadets and their allies who were bent on unleashing military \nconflict. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. It burned bright in the minds of Constituent \nAssembly deputies who had come to Petrograd demanding fair \npolitical treatment and the chance to bring Bolshevik rule peacefully \nto an end. Their current aim was to establish a government of Assembly \ndeputies in the Volga region and to seek the military removal of the \nBolsheviks from power throughout Russia. \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSOVNARKOM'S CHAIRMAN \nYet Lenin had an arsenal of self-confidence. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition.32 The Bolsheviks \nwould predictably dominate it since they held even more town and \ncity soviets than in October 1917. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. The tactical beauty of this, from the Bolshevik \nparty's standpoint, was that the overwhelming majority of the \ncountry's population were peasants and that Sovnarkom would \ntherefore come to appear as representative of the lower social classes \nin general and not just the workers and the urban poor. Bolshevik hegemony would be preserved. 33 \nNot that Lenin's planning lacked an idealistic aspect. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty. 36 Lenin had imbibed enough \nof the revolutionary spirit to allow fellow People's Commissars to \nraise subjects not previously tabled for discussion,37 but his instinct \nwas to reinforce order and orderliness. Lenin strove \nto pervade each session of Sovnarkom with an aura of austerity; only \nat the end, sometimes well after midnight, would he allow himself the \npleasure of social intercourse. Dzierzynski was a survivor of Siberian penal servitude and \nthe head of the Cheka; his name was enough to frighten the enemies \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof Bolshevism. 39 \nIn the intervals between Bolshevik Central Committee meetings,40 \nSovnarkom was the major centre of power in the country. Lenin tried \nto direct its entire work. Trotski and Stalin were invaluable collaborators, and \nthe skills of the Bolshevik ex-undergrounders at central and local \nlevels of government ought not to be forgotten. Trotski's past as an anti-Bolshevik and his obvious \ntalent (and, worse still, his knowledge of his talent) counted against \nhim. Of the other prominent Bolsheviks, both \nZinoviev and Kamenev had compromised themselves by their so-\ncalled 'strike-breaking' in October 1917; and younger leaders such as \nBukharin and Pyatakov, who were taken seriously by Lenin before \n1917 and who were to figure in his 'testament' of 1922, lacked \nLenin's prestige and authority. Alas, such assumptions are yet another \nexample of the blight cast by intellectual snobs like Trotski upon \naccounts of Soviet history. When all is said and done, however, none \nof these practical administrators rivalled Lenin. 43 \nNot that Lenin lived a life that was normal for most inhabitants of \nthe Soviet republic. He could order any book he \nwanted from any Russian library. Lenin, had many likeable personal traits; but he also had some \nexceedingly unpleasant and unusual ones.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation.49 \nThis title signified that nationalisation was no longer a Bolshevik \nshort-term aim. The Bolsheviks had \nwanted to base transfers of property to a greater extent with an \nincrease of productivity in mind; but the need to reconcile their \npartners in Sovnarkom forced them to give way. This meant that Bolshevism also had to forgo an \ninsistence on retention of the large estates in integral form; and that \nthe agricultural wage labourers, as distinct from poor peasants, were \nnot supported as strongly as the Bolsheviks had originally desired. 52 \nLenin won a few minor battles. 54 The return to \ntheir native villages of hundreds of thousands of peasant conscripts, \nwhose acquaintance with the Bolshevik programme was closer than \nthat of the normal rural population, made little difference. Local \nsoviets from January 1918 started to dispatch armed squads into the \ncountryside in quest of grain. 55 Sovnarkom desisted from com pre-\n The Obscene Peace \n315 \nhensive forcible requisitioning, and Lenin's occasional talk of an anti-\nspeculator terror was not yet a systematic and lasting policy. 56 \nThe Bolshevik inclination towards using violence against the \npeasantry, which is traceable to the manipulative attitude to \npeasants traditional in Bolshevik thought,57 was emerging, but the \narmy which would be necessary to suppress peasant discontent, was \nnot yet formed. Sovnarkom encouraged demobilisation of several \nregiments in late 1917. The pre-October commitment to demilitaris-\ning industrial production and switching to output for the civilian \nmarket was also being fulfilled; and Sverdlov engineered the closure \nof Bolshevik party committees in the Russian army on the Eastern \nfront. 58 Yet military conflict, in civil war and in foreign anti-\nBolshevik crusades, was expected. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.60 Six weeks later, on 21 January 1918, the Soviet authorities \nunilaterally annulled the foreign and domestic loans incurred by \nNikolai II and the Provisional Government.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists. \nThirty-eight per cent of large factories were closed in the first ten \nmonths of Soviet power.63 A state-managed industrial sector seemed \nto most Bolshevik leaders the cure for this problem. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists. But Bukharin and Osinski pressed for the creation of a \ngeneral body to co-ordinate the process and obtained Lenin's \nconsent.66 \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Council's ameliorative impact on the industry and trade was \nnegligible. Even Lenin was \naccepting the sober predictions of his associate, V. Milyutin, \nbefore October 1917.68 There were still Bolsheviks who drew up \nplans for a perfectly-functioning system of complete economic \nmanagement, as Lenin irritably noted. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. Few Bolsheviks objected when Aleksandr Shlyapnikov was \nappointed commissar with extra-legal powers to restore an opera-\ntional network. \nThis menacing condescension had been largely, but not wholly, \nsubmerged in Bolshevik pronouncements before October 1917. It \nreturned to prominence as the depth of the economic crisis was \nregistered by Sovnarkom and as the hopes of succour from fraternal \nsocialist revolutions lessened. The Bolshevik leaders did not \nenjoy the compulsion they were applying to the working class; they \nassumed that, in time, the workers would understand the require-\nments of the situation and would support the party. 73 Lenin's old adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nstrongly disapproved of what he regarded a a premature attempt at \nthe transition to socialism; and the dispersal of the Constituent \nAssembly appalled him. On 7 January, a day after the Constituent \nAssembly's closure and six days after the assassination attempt, the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders conferred while Trotski briefly took leave from \nBrest-Litovsk. The terms offered to the Soviet delegation by \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, especially the proposal that the \narmies of the Central Powers would maintain their occupation in \nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic region, had provoked a furious \nreaction in the local committees of the Bolshevik party. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. Lenin regarded a German invasion as a certainty, and \nbelieved that the possibility existed that the Germans might press \ndeeper into Soviet territory than was projected in their peace terms. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee. But it would give time for the \nBolsheviks to 'strangle' the Russian bourgeoisie and to prepare an \narmy for a future revolutionary war- he made no pretence of being a \npacifist.86 Lenin was obviously not the only Bolshevik leader who \ncould point to another Bolshevik leader's past failings. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened. Yet signs appeared that Lenin was gaining ground: five \nparticipants now voted in favour of a separate peace.95 Their anti-Lenin \narguments were not as unequivocal as they might have been. Lenin urged \na rapid reconvening of the peace talks and, if the Germans were still \nwilling, the signature of a treaty on the terms specified in December \n1917. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. Nerves of steel would still be required; nobody in the \nBolshevik Central Committee knew whether the Central Powers, \nonce their armies had started moving and found the resistance to be \nso feeble, would agree to halt. The \nrespective policies of Lenin and Trotski, mutually contradictory, had \nto be reassessed. \nThe republic would be confined to central, northern and south-\neastern Russia and the territory to the east. Russia would also have \nto demobilise, and would be compelled to protect the interests of \nGerman entrepreneurs. \nLenin, while suspecting him of posturing, declined to respond. 105 Lenin was horrified and threatened to \nleave Sovnarkom and the Central Committee: 'These terms must be \nsigned.' 106 Lomov struck back: 'It is \n 322 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnecessary to take power without V. [Lenin].'107 \nBut Lenin could see he would win. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means. Soviets, trade unions, factory-workshop commit-\ntees, and party organs: these were infused with Bolshevik personnel \nwho were instructed to get on with the job at hand.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. Naturally this \npushed leading Bolsheviks back into the central body where they \ncould resolve their own disagreements on policy definitively and \nwithout interference from other parties. The \nargument over coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries in November 1917 had involved a similar recourse to the \nCentral Committee; but the three months of controversy over the \nproposed separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmore intense and set a powerful precedent for subsequent develop-\nmentsY1 \n The Obscene Peace \n323 \nThe party as a whole resumed greater importance when the Brest-\nLitovsk negotiations were discussed. While the battle raged in the \nCentral Committee, Bolsheviks at lower levels was riven by conflict. Only Trotski \ncame near to him in prestige as a pre-eminent Soviet statesman; but \neven Trotski could have no claim to recognition as the Bolshevik \nparty chief. There was talk among them of dropping \nLenin from the government and even of imprisoning him if this alone \nwould guarantee the retention of a policy hostile to a separate peace. 114 \nLenin, by contrast, was someone who could confront a difficult \nsituation and take responsibility for the outcome. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. But his international policy of 1918 came \nout well in comparison with the suggestions of his Left Communist \nopponents. \nLenin also had the advantage of possessing a strong group in the \ncentral party apparatus. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. Lenin and his friends were old hands at manipulating \nlists of delegates. 118 His proven skills as a polemicist made Lenin, who had \nalways had a soft spot for 'Grisha', forgive everything that had \nhappened between them in October 1917. 123 \nMany Bolshevik opponents experienced inhibitions in attacking him. Safarov denied that Lenin's faction were \ndescribable as 'collaborators' with imperialism. 126 The sheer impracticality of the Left Communists, \nas they were becoming known, played into Lenin's hands. 127 In addi-\ntion, there could be no revolutionary war if only the local Bolshevik \ncommittee members were in favour of fighting it. Hence their otherwise odd belief that, when \nit came to a fight with the Germans, the Russian peasants would \nenlist en masse. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. 129 \nIt is against this background that the swing towards Lenin has to \nbe assessed. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. Their commitment to intra-\nparty democracy was no firmer than Lenin's. Without Lenin, the Brest-Litovsk \ntreaty would probably not have been signed; and the Germans might \nwell have invaded all Russia. But Lenin had a tide of mass opinion \nrunning his way, and no Russian politician knew better how to \nexploit his advantages. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 134 Success, according to \nLenin, had been possible only because 'international imperialism' \nwas temporarily distracted from intervening in Russia. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany. Russia had a semi-industrialized economy which had \nbeen devastated by the war; she lacked even an army. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. Just as Lenin's Bolshevik followers had \nswallowed their pride by participating in Stolypin's emasculated \nThird State Duma in 1907, so now they ought to conclude a \nseparate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bolshevik leftists were like the Polish noblemen of \nformer times who died in a beautiful pose, saying: 'Peace is a \ndisgrace, war is honour. Lenin was lucky to face such opponents. \nLenin was gambling on obtaining a lengthy breathing space, on the \nGermans abiding by their word, on the inability of the two military \ncoalitions in the War to come together to strangle the young Soviet \nrepublic in its cradle. So \n 328 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhy bend the knee to the German high command at Brest-Litovsk. Uritski noted sarcastically that \nLenin would sign a separate peace even if it was destined to last only \na couple of days. 144 Like other Bolshevik leftists, Uritski was \nhorrified both by the compulsory evacuation of the recently-\nconquered Ukraine and by the compulsory demobilisation of the \nRussian army.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. This was a polemical opportunity \nthat would not have been missed by Lenin if the roles had been \nreversed. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. 153 \nTrotski also helped Lenin by declaring contempt for the leftist plan \nfor partisan warfare conducted with 'the knives of Pskov peasants' \ninstead of rifles and artillery. Ryazanov was less charitable \nto Lenin's group, accusing Sverdlov of closing down the party's \norganisations in the old army solely in order to make it harder for the \nparty to resist the proposal for a separate peace. Stozhok from the Donbass opposed Lenin's policy; \n0. Maskov, a Urals \ndelegate, came over to Lenin's side despite having been mandated \nto advocate revolutionary war. 160 Debate was ended, and \nBukharin's closing speech predicted that the 'breathing space' would \nnot be realised and that Lenin would soon have to adopt the position \nof the Bolshevik left. Abrasively, he added: 'To declare war on \nGermany now would mean giving in to the provocation of the \nRussian bourgeoisie. And where Lenin had spoken generally about \na breathing-space before 'the attack of the imperialists', Trotski \nwanted to mention 'the inevitable and imminent attack'. The motion called for 'the most energetic, \nmercilessly decisive and draconian measures to raise the self-\ndiscipline and discipline of the workers and peasants of Russia'; it \ndeclared that 'a liberationist, patriotic socialist war' was unavoidable, \nand that universal military training should be put in hand. Lenin held himself aloof from the wrangling. The \nepisode gave further reinforcement to Lenin's position as patriarch of \nhis party. His aim was to \nincorporate sections in the programme to highlight the differences \nbetween the Bolsheviks and most other adherents of the Second \nInternational. Lenin, denouncing 'bourgeois democratism', called for a \nnew type of democracy based on the Russian soviets. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. While 'subscribing to Lenin's every word in his characterisa-\ntion of the state', he called for a definition of socialism. Lenin's \nvague references to the nationalisation of the means of production \nlacked the necessary concreteness. Trotski's success signalled his meteoric rise in the \nBolshevik party. \nConflicts between the peasantry and the local soviets were intensi-\nfied. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. Anti-Bolshevik \nregimes had sprung up in the Transcaucasus and counter-revolu-\ntionary armies were being formed in south Russia and Siberia to \noverthrow Sovnarkom. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. He sought \ninfluence among Marxists. He did not control the Bolshevik faction \nand, in the First World War, his contacts with its members in the \nRussian empire became extremely frail and intermittent. \nNevertheless, at the level of political philosophy, he markedly \ninfluenced his own Bolsheviks even though they objected to his \ndivisive tirades; and, as often as not, it was Lenin who set the agenda \nfor Bolshevik debates even if he did not always win them. He had \nthe inestimable advantage that the maintenance of a foreign-based \napparatus was important for Bolsheviks in the Russian empire. \nAnd so he survived, acquiring the prestige of a veteran and a major \nthinker among Bolsheviks. Lenin, like his comrades, also found much to detest in the \nwhole political and economic order of pre-war Europe, and his rage \nreached a peak of intensity in the First World War. His \nMarxism evinced a fanaticism which was common in varying degrees \namong Bolsheviks - and it was alloyed with non-Marxist doctrines \nand impulses which he did not acknowledge. Bolshevism was not the \n 334 \nLenin: A Political Life \noriginator of all ideas of dictatorship. The idea that the oppressive \ntsarist order should be followed immediately by an order which \nforeswore authoritarianism had a long tradition in Russian revolu-\ntionary attitudes before the Bolsheviks existed; and it was not \nconfined to the Russian empire either. Lenin's framework of Marx-\nism was very elastic. On many questions of Russian politics and \neconomics, furthermore, he developed ideas which were combatively \nexpressed. When he insisted that the Bolsheviks should address the \nnational question, he took risks with his own reputation among \nthem. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. Yet this was an \nexaggerated image; Russian military defeat and economic collapse \nwere not caused by him and his party, and the Provisional \nGovernment was falling headlong before its dissolution. Civil war was more the making of Lenin than of any other \nsingle person. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. Yet the socio-economic requirements of urban \nRussia clashed with what was demanded by the countryside. \nLenin's policies misjudged the enormity of the old Russian em-\npire's crisis. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. The chances of the prolonged survival of such a regime, \nlinking Bolsheviks with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, \nhad never been large; but Lenin was prominent in preventing the \nattempt from being made. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world.", "Bolshevik_Hegemony_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. Every Central \nCommittee member approved this with reluctance, taking it for granted \nthat a resurgence of private commerce would strengthen the social \nforces in the country hostile to the Bolsheviks. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. Connoisseurs of his style were able to recall that in 1918, despite \nhaving being the protagonist of a separate peace treaty with Germany \nand Austria-Hungary, he insisted that others in the Bolshevik party \nleadership should go out to Brest-Litovsk to do the signing. Certainly \nhe could plead pre-occupation with other business which was being \nreported to him: the Anglo-Soviet negotiations; the Kronstadt and \nTambov revolts; the attempted seizure of power in Berlin by the \nGerman Communist Party with their 'March Action'; the worsening \nconflicts in the Soviet trade union leadership; industrial strikes in \nSoviet Russia; dissent in the Bolshevik party; the activities of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries; the establishment of 'Soviet \npower' in the Transcaucasus. 5 \nLenin was in the chair. The \nparty monopolised power not only in theory but also in reality; the \nsupreme issue on the agenda of Soviet politics was not to be devolved \nto the formal state authorities until policy had been fixed by the \nBolshevik leadership. 10 Lenin was staying \nout of the highlight. 13 \nThus the potential region of greatest grain surplus in the Soviet-ruled \nrepublics was to be exempted from Lenin's reform. The antagonism of \nthe Ukraine-based Bolshevik leadership, already expressed at the Tenth \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nParty Congress, may have had an influence; 14 but probably Kamenev \nand his colleagues- with Lenin in agreement in the background- were \nthemselves worried about a resurgence of Ukrainian private trade \nbefore the completion of the transfer of land from gentry and rich \npeasants. The \nBolshevik party's fear of kulak-led resistance to its authority was so \nstrong that even the Ukrainian equivalent of the committees of the \nvillage poor, abolished in Russia in December 1918, remained in \nexistence until the mid-1920s. \nBolshevik leaders before and during the Party Congress had considered \nideas on reform limited to bartering between the peasant producer and \nboth the state procurer and the individual consumer; private traders \nhad not been envisaged. Lenin was lying low. There was conflict between the People's Commissariat of \nFood Supplies and the Central Statistical Administration in the \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n189 \nestimation of the grainstocks available; and Lenin, with his expertise in \nthe geography of agriculture going back to his 1899 book The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia, was naturally drawn into \narbitrating. \nCONQUEST OF EMPIRE \nAt the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently Lenin had demanded a \nunion between workers and peasants. Gentle towards the peasants he met, Lenin was brutal in his \ndispensations of policy. \nRepression was at its most intense in the grain-producing areas of \nRussia.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved. Any of their leaders discovered in Moscow and Petro grad were to \nbe arrested on sight; the fitful existence allowed to their parties in the \nCivil War was to be terminated.35 Propa-\nganda would, Lenin hoped, eventually redress the discredit into which \nthe Bolshevik regime had fallen. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921. 37 The Bolsheviks had \nalienated the non-Russians to a lesser extent than had the Whites in \nprevious years; but this led no party leader to think that the 'national \nquestion' had been solved. On the contrary, the lands of the former \nRussian empire were seething with political unrest among the various \nnations and ethnic groups. \nThe conquest of the Transcaucasus had meant that the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic (or RSFSR), Ukraine and Belorussia \nwere joined as independent Soviet republics by Azerbaidzhan, Armenia \nand Georgia.38 But the preferred long-term ties \namong all six Soviet republics were not specified. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin.40 Lenin wished to form a \nfederation of Russia, Ukraine and other republics whereas Stalin \nwanted to incorporate these other republics in the RSFSR with rights \nof 'autonomy' of the type inaugurated with the Bashkir Republic in \n1919. To treat Ukraine in such a way, according \nto Lenin was 'chauvinism'.41 Russia and its Bolshevik leaders had to go \nout of their way to demonstrate their anti-nationalist credentials; and \nhe was annoyed that his nearest major ally in the party on these \nquestions had turned against him. For \nLenin, the addition of Ukraine to a federal multinational state would \nmerely have been the prelude to the additions of Poland and Germany. Perhaps Stalin, unlike Lenin, was \nalso aiming to have as strong and large an RSFSR as possible so as to \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nact as a counterweight to a future Soviet Germany; but Lenin the \nRussian was less Russocentric than Stalin the Georgian, and he was \napparently untroubled about a Soviet federation in Central and \nEastern Europe which might not be dominated by Russia. A tacit understanding therefore \nemerged between Lenin and Stalin that other more pressing matters of \npolitics and economy should engage their attention: the fractiousness \nof the 'trade union controversy' was considered an ill-affordable \nluxury. \nNot that the affairs of the non-Russian nationalities were overlooked \nby Lenin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. \nInitially Lenin, the lifelong harrier of the Mensheviks, advocated the \nquest of 'an acceptable compromise' with the Georgian Menshevik \nleader Noi Zhordania. Such advice from Moscow at a time when the \nRussian Mensheviks were being thrown into the prisons of the Cheka. On 14 April 1921 he sent an open letter to 'the \ncommunist comrades of Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan \nand the Mountain Republic' demanding that local conditions be \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n193 \nrespected. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. \nHis reasoning was not just that the region was predominantly agrarian \nor that Bolshevik rule was under threat. He also asserted that the \nTranscaucasus could act as a conduit for trade between the Soviet \nrepublics and the West. \nThus it came about that Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin's full support, \nsought to reinforce control over each republic by constraining them \nwithin a Transcaucasian Federation. \nMyasnikyan, who had a leading role in the Armenian Bolshevik \nleadership, to appear at the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in \nDecember 1921 to demand the Transcaucasian Federation's creation. 53 \nStill there was no deliberation as to the permanent arrangements to \nbe made among the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and the proposed \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTranscaucasian Federation. Stalin wrote to Lenin on 13 January 1922 \nrepeating his commitment to the incorporation of all of them within \nthe RSFSR. Possibly he \nwas content to see the Transcaucasian Federation, which was \npromulgated despite Georgian Bolshevik resistance on 12 March, \ncome into existence before moving on to a grander constitutional \nproject. Clashes between the Central \nCommittee in Moscow and the Bolshevik politicians of Ukraine had \noccurred since 1918. The \nattempt by Moscow to break up Ukraine into separate economic areas \nwas resented. 56 On 11 March 1922 the Ukrainian Politburo complained \nto the Central Committee in Moscow about a series of infringements of \nthe republic's rights as embodied in the treaty with the RSFSR.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party. He was not only an avid centraliser \nwho imposed Moscow's policies on the peripheral regions; he was also \nthe leader most often called upon by Moscow to mediate in conflicts \nbetween one region and another. The spats over the territorial limits of \nBashkiria in 1919 were followed by several others within the RSFSR; \nand, most notoriously, a menacing disturbance broke out between the \nAzerbaidzhani and Armenian Soviet republics over the ownership of \nNagorny Karabakh. In 1920 the Politburo had ruled in favour of \nArmenia, but in 1921 Nagorny Karabakh - despite being heavily \npopulated by Armenians- was handed to Azerbaidzhan.59 \nSooner or later, however, Stalin and Lenin would clash over Stalin's \nproject for 'autonomisation'. He \npromoted non-Russian Bolsheviks to high office.60 Furthermore, his duties as \nPeople's Commissar for Nationality Affairs left him in no doubt how \nfrail the Bolshevik party was in the non-Russian republics. Bolsheviks \nwere few in number, were usually disproportionately drawn from \nethnic Russians as well as from persons who had joined the party late \nin the Civil War.61 The arguments for letting republican Bolshevik \norganisations take full charge of their respective republics were not self-\nevident. The will to retain the peoples of the Soviet \nlands subject to the party's power and policies, by force if the need \narose, was common to both men. Stalin was therefore unprepared for \nthe intensity of Lenin's hostility when it revealed itself from autumn \n1922. \nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS \nBoth Lenin and Stalin at any rate knew that the 'national question' was \ninseparably linked to issues of foreign policy. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism. 64 \nThe Politburo was perplexed as to how to develop a line which \nwould simultaneously enhance territorial security, facilitate the spread \nof socialist revolutions and attract investment from foreign capitalists. Lenin rightly believed that, however successful they were with \nthese important but lesser states, it would be progress with the Allies \nthat would determine the Soviet regime's survival. Lenin had hopes for a \nrapprochement with the USA, and such was his gullibility that he was \ntricked by a commercial mountebank called Vanderlip who claimed \nthat, if granted the timber concession in Kamchatka in the Far East, he \nwould guarantee that the American administration would take a pro-\nSoviet orientation.6s About the French, who were owed vast sums of \nmoney since before the October Revolution, Lenin harboured no \nillusions.66 Nevertheless the \nBritish cabinet took a benign view and, despite further disagreements, \nthe negotiating process went well; and Lenin looked forward to adding \nthe United Kingdom to the smaller states of the Baltic as his country's \ntrading partners. In \npublic he had argued, on 6 December 1920, that Russian participation \nin world trade was necessary for economic recovery everywhere.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921. \nZinoviev suffered the embarrassment of having 'black-legged' against \nthe Bolshevik party in the October Revolution; he over-compensated \nfor this in the Communist International by zeal for foreign socialist \nadventures (which may also explain the roisterings of his fellow alleged \nblack-leg Kamenev in London in 1920).72 At the time \nLenin did not comment. Lenin's diary in \nMarch was filled with considerations about the tax in kind, the \nGeorgian operation, the Kronstadt and Tambov revolts, the arrange-\nment of foreign concessions, the trade treaties, the Tenth Party \nCongress. \nThe episode shows how even Lenin did not control his colleagues \nover all policies. Equally Lenin's political distance from the March Action \ndemonstrates the intensity of his pre-occupation with the multifaceted \ncrisis confronting the Soviet state. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession. Nevertheless Lenin was often \nknown to play two games at once. Soviet \nRussia was on the edge of the abyss. \nLenin unusually kept aloof from the debate among his colleagues.80 His proposals for Baku, Grozny, \nDon bass and Kamchatka were contentious, and he may have judged it \nunnecessary to cause further dispute by raising doubts about the \nimminence of socialist revolutions in Europe. Lenin's favourite \nassertion that the Bolshevik party should focus on practical tasks and \nshould give up its chattering carried the implication that theorising \nshould be kept in the background.81 Yet Lenin \nfrequently tried to have his cake and eat it too. Lenin \npreferred to get on with government and to leave speculation to others. 'Left' and 'right' were no longer easily definable terms \namong Bolsheviks. On international relations, Lenin \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspoke in the most general terms to the difficulties of the labour \nmovement abroad; but, although he talked about the inception of a \ncrisis in world capitalism, he used vague language and implied no \ncriticism of Trotski.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition. Such was to be the interpretation of \nNikita Khrushchev.88 Even then, Lenin is recorded as having mentioned co-\nexistence without breathing anything about its being peaceful. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Lenin himself put \ninverted commas around 'co-habitation', thereby signalling his \nrecognition that an eventual violent clash between socialism and \ncapitalism was probable. The political \nirreconcilability of the Soviet regime and the capitalist West was a \nfoundation stone of his world-view. Toning down \nTrotski's presentation, Lenin at the Ninth Congress of Soviets \ncharacterised capitalism with the followint words: 'What has been \nachieved is a certain fragile equilibrium'. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen. An electoral curia for 'parasites' \n(or the former middle and upper classes) would not put the party's \npower at risk and yet would induce foreign capitalists to invest in the \nSoviet republics.92 \nTo Lenin's mind, trade links should be restored only if the gains of \nthe October Revolution and the Civil War were not damaged. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement. No such \nthought crossed Lenin's mind or left his lips even though he \nincreasingly behaved as if 'European socialist revolution' was not \nimmediately in prospect. Lenin had been discussing only the regime's \nsurvival rather than the implementation of all the tasks described \nbefore October 1917 in The State and Revolution. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore. Similarly, as the price of the Anglo-Soviet trade treaty, \nhe had had to promise to suspend anti-capitalist propaganda in Britain \nand her empire. The \nCommunist International was not formally under Moscow's control \nand could go on conducting propaganda in its own name; and, of \ncourse, the treaty in no way stipulated a dismantlement of the so-called \ndictatorship of the proletariat in the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics. On the contrary, it was aimed at active party \nmembers in Moscow and the provinces. In elucidating his own \nintentions, Lenin had to work hard to keep fellow Bolsheviks on his \nside. Lenin claimed that the dangers \nwere avoidable. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. Lenin repeated that the agreeing of \n'concessions' with foreign entrepreneurs would make an important \ncontribution to the resources of the Soviet state. But Lenin's \nwords involved, too, a deal of obfuscation. Of course, there had been armed struggle ever since 25 \nOctober 1917. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. He \nforesaw the party's reluctance to abandon ultra-centralist state \neconomic intervention, and he wanted to disseminate the idea that \nthe New Economic Policy simply restored measures that had once had \nthe general concurrence of Bolsheviks. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. 104 \nLenin still wrote as a confident social engineer.' 106 He had largely \nstopped bothering with arguments put forward by non-Bolsheviks; but \non this occasion he considered the case against terror put by Martov \nthe Menshevik and Chernov the Socialist-Revolutionary.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. 'It is impossible to distinguish speculation from \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \n\"correct\" trade,' Lenin added, ' if speculation is to be understood in the \npolitico-economic sense. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. He utterly denied that the Bolsheviks had been in any way \nto blame for the revolt, and he noted the comfort taken in the events on \nKronstadt by Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries and Kadets. It was worse in his opinion \nin Moscow than in the localities. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'. But his remedy \nwas hopelessly inadequate; and, in recommending it, Lenin showed \nhimself to be out of touch with those many Bolshevik leaders who by \nnow enjoyed and wanted to prolong their life of privilege and power in \nthe capital. Bolsheviks had to buckle down to \ntheir own education: 'We must not be scared to admit that here there is \nstill much that can and must be learned from the capitalist.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. This was \nembarrassing for the Bolsheviks, who prided themselves on being the \n'vanguard' of the working class; but conditions in the towns could not \nbe improved until trade with the villages, which necessitated material \nincentives being given to the peasantry, was restored. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. Progress might be impeded, and it remained \nLenin's contention that it would take decades before socialism could be \nattained in Russia. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. The \nBolsheviks were few, but they were united: 'And we know what we \nwant. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. Opinion among \nMoscow Bolsheviks was very agitated; the City Party Committee \nsecretary P. 121 But Lenin, when he heard of \nthis, was infuriated. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. Dzierzynski as a supporter of internal \nparty discipline backed Lenin. 124 \nQuietly the matter was dropped, and Lenin was left to allow his ire to \nexpire. 125 Perforce the Conference's organisation was \nhurried and ramshackle; but Lenin was reconciled to its necessity. Once more the individual performance of Lenin would be \ncrucial. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. 131 Their words were like extra \nchapters to Lenin's booklet; they constituted a case for New Economic \nPolicy not merely to be accepted but also extended into other areas of \nthe economy. Five lengthy lectures had come \nfrom Lenin, Milyutin, Khinchuk, Sviderski and Preobrazhenski. Vareikis, like speakers after him, \nattacked Lenin. Vareikis, a Bolshevik \nsophisticated in the party's doctrines, challenged the Marxist validity \nof Lenin's attitude to the peasantry. He scrutinised Lenin's pamphlet \nwith acidic wit. Chubar added to Lenin's woes. Always the target was Lenin. There had been no such Congress or \nConference in the history of the Bolshevik party, not even in the Brest-\nLitovsk dispute. In short, Lenin's report had been out of touch with the real \nsituation.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 50 \nNonetheless Lenin had indisputably carried a greater load than the \nrest, and the load involved a concatenation of crises in the economy, \nadministration, politics, security and foreign policy. \nLenin had seen red. Coming from Lenin, it sounded utterly serious. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it. Essentially he wanted \nconfirmation that he had done his best and that his measures were \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \napproved. No other Bolshevik leader could have saved the foundations \nof the New Economic Policy at this Conference in quite this way. Lenin \nsat down, battered but victorious at last. Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. \nAlready, as he admitted, there were controversies among Politburo \nmembers as to whether the Communist International confronted a \nperiod of 'quiescence' when the capitalist economies would stabilise \nthemselves and prevent revolutionary conturbation. Bumazhny attacked Lenin. For Bumazhny, Lenin's On the Food Tax was aimed at too \nsophisticated a readership. Lenin had misjudged the needs of situation: \nthe ordinary party members as wen as the Bolshevik inte11ectua1 elite \nhad to be addressed. But Lenin replied dismissively. This time Lenin reacted more diplomatically. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. But the Russian Communist Party \ncould not guess when it would happen. 163 \nFor the moment the Bolsheviks had to elaborate their measures on \nthe premise that the October Revolution stood alone. The \nConference had been gruelling, and had put Lenin on his mettle. \nBut nobody could any longer state that the reform had been slipped \ninto the Bolshevik official projections without sustained consultation \nand ratification. The lines sketched by \nLenin, Milyutin, Khinchuk, Sviderski, and Preobrazhenski were \npursued with panache. Nikolai Valentinov, an ex-Bolshevik who had many contacts \nwith the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, recorded having heard that \nVareikis shouted that Lenin had lopped off 'whole chapters of \nMarxism'. It was not until October \nthat Lenin recommenced his public defence of reform. Commemorat-\ning the fourth anniversary of the Bolshevik party's seizure of power, he \nwrote in Pravda: 'Would that such a global affair could be begun \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n215 \nwithout failures and without mistakes. Indeed cognoscenti of Lenin's agrarian analysis in 1917 \nwould have noticed how closely Preobrazhenski followed it;179 Lenin \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould not dismiss his critic out of hand. But Preobrazhenski, who until \nthen had worked harmoniously with Lenin, irritated him more than \nany other leading Bolshevik opponent at the time. Lenin castigated the 'empty' phrases and \n'boring' expressions of intent. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future.' 182 \nThis was the sort of rhetorical souffle which, if cooked by a \nProvisional Government minister in 1917 or a Bolshevik opositionist in \n1918-1920, Lenin would have relished puncturing. In \nthis he had the advantage that, at least by midsummer, no central or \nlocal Bolshevik leader seriously proposed that the Politburo should re-\nintroduce food-supplies requisitioning. It was \npredictable that not all his fellow Bolsheviks were reconciled to the \nfurther measures on trade, finance and industry. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. 183 \nIn fact all Bolshevik leaders were committed to the reinforcement of \ncentral state planning sooner or later; and Lenin was no exception \neither in 1921 or thereafter. Furthermore, he was determined that any \ndiscussion about the New Economic Policy should involve only \nBolsheviks. He could not stress too heavily that Bolshevik hegemony \nover contemporary issues of politics, economics and culture should be \nmaintained, 184 and he kept a weather eye open for those anti-\nBolsheviks seeking to take advantage of the reforms introduced by \nthe Politburo. Bolsheviks arguing among themselves were one \nthing; Bolsheviks indulging their enemies by allowing them access to \nthe printing press was entirely another. Even as Lenin had been \ninitiating discussions on agrarian reform in February 1921, he was \nchairing Sovnarkom sessions which required Gosplan to draw up a \nsingle comprehensive plan for all sectors of the economy. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed. Scarcely had the ashes of the \n'trade union discussion' been raked into the earth than Trotski and \nLenin were lighting a touch-paper for yet another inflammation of the \nparty. No wonder that \nLenin had been acting cautiously with his day-to-day tactics since the \nTenth Party Conference.", "Peace_Treaty_1917": " The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution.94 Moreover, \nboth Bukharin and Uritski agreed that such a peace was 'permissible' \nif the Germans simply broke off negotiations. Sovnarkom, he declared, \nwould not sully itself with the signature of a separate peace but \nwould not resume the war either. Lenin urged \na rapid reconvening of the peace talks and, if the Germans were still \nwilling, the signature of a treaty on the terms specified in December \n1917. A spontaneous separate peace \nbetween the soldiers of the two sides was one thing; a treaty was \nentirely another. The obscene peace, the separate \nand annexationist peace, was to be signed. Neither condition was met from January 1918 \nwhen rifts opened on the issues of war and peace. The \nargument over coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu-\ntionaries in November 1917 had involved a similar recourse to the \nCentral Committee; but the three months of controversy over the \nproposed separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary were \nmore intense and set a powerful precedent for subsequent develop-\nmentsY1 \n The Obscene Peace \n323 \nThe party as a whole resumed greater importance when the Brest-\nLitovsk negotiations were discussed. And throughout \nJanuary and February 1918 he had contributed weighty articles to \nPravda putting the case for the signature of a separate peace \ntreaty. Just as Lenin's Bolshevik followers had \nswallowed their pride by participating in Stolypin's emasculated \nThird State Duma in 1907, so now they ought to conclude a \nseparate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary.' 137 Lenin argued that a peace treaty would \ngive a 'breathing space'. But he \nunexpectedly urged the Congress to vote for a spatial withdrawal \nwithout the accompaniment of a formal treaty; and he pleaded that, \nif the Congress none the less was intent on a treaty, no peace should \nsimultaneously be signed with the Ukrainian Rada. 163 Thereupon the Congress returned \n 330 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto the discussion of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty and, as expected, \nconfirmed Lenin's pro-peace motion as the basis of its resolution. \nHe wanted to say that the signature of the peace was 'permissible' \nrather than 'necessary'.", "Bolshevik_Rule_1917": " It has been tempting \nto treat the Russian revolutionary events as if they were entirely \nindependent of the situation in the rest of the world and as if Russia, \nwhile having an impact on other countries, did not in her turn \nregister their impact. The attempt to put an end to the fighting, \nthrough the Decree on Peace presented by Lenin on 26 October 1917, \nwas not followed by a pan-European socialist revolution. As night \nfollows day, it was certain that Russian withdrawal from the conflict \nwould attract unpleasant consequences from abroad. If revolutions failed \nto occur in Europe, the chances of Sovnarkom's survival were \nintimately linked to the question of whether any foreign capitalist \npower had the resources and opportunity to intervene militarily in \nRussia. No Russian army in 1917-18 could have repelled the armed \nmight of either the Germans or the Allies if such might had been \nturned on them in concerted fashion. \nThus the absence of revolutionary explosions in Europe, as Lenin \nwas to concede, 1 meant that his regime's fortunes depended \nultimately on a factor beyond its control: the continued mutual \nexhaustion of the Central Powers and the Allies in the War. The party's \npolitical triumph in Russia too was being called into question in the \nfirst winter after the Bolshevik-led revolution. \nLenin's name had been on several successful lists put forward by \nthe Bolsheviks; and, in accordance with the then current system of \nproportional representation, he chose to be returned as one of the \ndeputies for the Baltic fleet. His manipulativeness and \nlack of public candour was so extreme that, while the Second \nCongress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was in \nsession, he implored his Bolshevik Central Committee colleagues to \nannounce a postponement of the Constituent Assembly elections.4 \nThis was a natural corollary of his admission to the Central \nCommittee on 10 October that the Constituent Assembly would \nnot side with the Bolsheviks. Only 168, or 22 per cent, were Bolsheviks; they had suffered a \nmassive defeat. In industrial cities and in places with \nlarge army garrisons the Bolsheviks held the upper hand; and the \nBoishevik party acquitted itself well also in those rural regions from \nwhich the peasantry tended to migrate in search of seasonal work in \nnearby factories. But peasant Russian general - and Russia was \ndemographically still mainly a backward, agrarian society- voted for \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries. 7 The Bolsheviks had never \nexpected to win the election outright: even in his 'optimistic' \npronouncements on the party's electoral prospects in advance of \nthe seizure of power in Petrograd, Lenin had calculated that \ncollaboration with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries would be \nnecessary.8 And yet no Bolshevik before October is recorded as \nhaving anticipated the scale of the actual defeat. \nBolshevik spokesmen argued that the Assembly arrangements had \nbeen unfair to them. The elections had been held quickly after the \nOctober Revolution, too quickly for the popularity of Sovnarkom's \nsocial and economic reforms to be transformed into direct political \nsupport for the Bolsheviks in the countryside. The problem was not confined to the split \nwith the Left Socialist Revolutionaries; there were also divisions \nbetween the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its local \ncommittees in the non-Russian areas. \nThe dilemma of the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutio-\nnaries remained: what to do about the Constituent Assembly as \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nelected. Lenin recognised that \ncaution had to be exercised with regard to his own party members \n(who were not universally in favour of the Assembly's suppression), \nto some among his Left Socialist Revolutionary allies and to a \ngeneral population which might not take kindly to the infringement \nof its newly-obtained democratic rights. \nAnti-Assembly opinion among Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries was already hardening. On 12 \nDecember, Lenin successfully called for the reselection of the Bureau \nof the Bolshevik fraction in the Assembly on the grounds that a \nsterner attitude towards the Assembly was appropriate: nothing was \nbeing left to chance. 18 Yet Lenin refused \nto be deflected from his tasks. On 3 \nJanuary 1918 the announcement was made on Sovnarkom's behalf \nthat the Constituent Assembly would be acceptable only if it \nsupported 'soviet power'. 20 This was the code for a stipulation that \nSovnarkom, under Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership, should be ratified as the legitimate government and that \nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks should not demand to \nform a cabinet. 22 A demonstration held by supporters \nof the Assembly, who naively supposed that the Bolsheviks would \nnot use force upon fellow socialists, was fired upon. Uproar \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out.24 (It was also a very rare \nexample of Lenin using quasi-humorous behaviour to achieve a \npolitical end. The \nBolshevik Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Socialist Revolutionary \nIzaak Shteinberg, speaking for the Sovnarkom coalition, again \ndemanded the Assembly's recognition of soviet power. The Socialist Revolu-\ntionary agenda was accepted by a vote on the floor, and the \nBolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries walked out in \nprotest. By late evening he was \nreading out the details of legislation that he now perceived the \nBolsheviks would stop him implementing.25 \nMeanwhile Lenin, conferring with the Bolshevik fraction, decided \nthat there should be no second session of the Assembly.26 Orders \nwere issued forbidding the Palace guard to attack the opponents of \nSovnarkom as they left the building; earlier in the day a Bolshevik \nsupporter had pointed his rifle at the unfortunate Shvetsov as he was \nspeaking.27 A forlorn group of anti-Bolshevik Constituent \nAssembly delegates left the Palace, never to return. The Bolsheviks had \nwon the struggle. Lenin could at last relax. Bonch-Bruevich later \nrecalled: 'Lenin was agitated and was paler than ever before . Perhaps he was getting his own back for the \nderision he had suffered at their hands when, at the First Congress of \nSoviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in June 1917, he had \nexclaimed that his party was willing to rule Russia alone. Lenin's self-\nrestraint could not disguise the momentousness of the occasion. With \nor without Lenin's actions, there would probably have been civil war \nin Russia after the Provisional Government's demise. But the \ndestruction of the Constituent Assembly, which was ratified by a \ndecree of Sovnarkom on 6 January, ensured that the anti-Bolshevik \narmies would be stronger than they might otherwise have been. \nMany Socialist Revolutionaries were to fight against the Reds, not \nbecause they shared the aims of generals from the old imperial \nregiments but in pursuit of rectifying the great wrong done to their \nparty at the Tauride Palace. The Bolsheviks had talked increasingly \nabout civil war since coming to power, but they claimed that it was \nthe Kadets and their allies who were bent on unleashing military \nconflict. Bolsheviks could no longer appear plausible with such talk, \nyet their confidence was strengthened by the feeling that they were \nthe makers of a successful revolution. In addition, the ease of the \nAssembly's dispersal inhibited further opposition among Bolsheviks \nto the retention of a coalition of only two socialist parties in \nSovnarkom. No sooner had the dispersal taken place, moreover, than the \nSovnarkom coalition was swept into tumultuous discussions about \nforeign policy; and the memory of the events of 5-6 January 1918 \nquickly faded from the minds of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary leaders. It burned bright in the minds of Constituent \nAssembly deputies who had come to Petrograd demanding fair \npolitical treatment and the chance to bring Bolshevik rule peacefully \nto an end. Their current aim was to establish a government of Assembly \ndeputies in the Volga region and to seek the military removal of the \nBolsheviks from power throughout Russia. \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSOVNARKOM'S CHAIRMAN \nYet Lenin had an arsenal of self-confidence. Lenin's plan was simple: to lull the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries into a false sense of security about their weight of \nimportance in the coalition.32 The Bolsheviks \nwould predictably dominate it since they held even more town and \ncity soviets than in October 1917. Lenin proposed that the Congress called under the auspices \nof the Left Socialist Revolutionaries should fuse itself with the \nBolshevik-dominated Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' \nand Cossacks' Deputies and that a joint Central Executive Commit-\ntee should be created. The tactical beauty of this, from the Bolshevik \nparty's standpoint, was that the overwhelming majority of the \ncountry's population were peasants and that Sovnarkom would \ntherefore come to appear as representative of the lower social classes \nin general and not just the workers and the urban poor. Bolshevik hegemony would be preserved. The Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries were as naive about the Bolshevik central leader-\nship's ruthlessness as the Socialist Revolutionaries had been about \nLenin's disregard for the rights of the Constituent Assembly; but at \n The Obscene Peace \n311 \nthe time they thought the deal worth making since the Bolsheviks \nwere willing to offer them compromises on the single act of \nlegislation, then under preparation, that most interested them: the \nBasic Land Law. 33 \nNot that Lenin's planning lacked an idealistic aspect. Governing, for Lenin, was a serious enterprise and duty. 36 Lenin had imbibed enough \nof the revolutionary spirit to allow fellow People's Commissars to \nraise subjects not previously tabled for discussion,37 but his instinct \nwas to reinforce order and orderliness. Dzierzynski was a survivor of Siberian penal servitude and \nthe head of the Cheka; his name was enough to frighten the enemies \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof Bolshevism. 39 \nIn the intervals between Bolshevik Central Committee meetings,40 \nSovnarkom was the major centre of power in the country. Lenin tried \nto direct its entire work. Trotski and Stalin were invaluable collaborators, and \nthe skills of the Bolshevik ex-undergrounders at central and local \nlevels of government ought not to be forgotten. Unlike Trotski and \nStalin, however, Lenin succeeded in doing this without giving \nlifelong offence. Trotski's past as an anti-Bolshevik and his obvious \ntalent (and, worse still, his knowledge of his talent) counted against \nhim. Of the other prominent Bolsheviks, both \nZinoviev and Kamenev had compromised themselves by their so-\ncalled 'strike-breaking' in October 1917; and younger leaders such as \nBukharin and Pyatakov, who were taken seriously by Lenin before \n1917 and who were to figure in his 'testament' of 1922, lacked \nLenin's prestige and authority. When all is said and done, however, none \nof these practical administrators rivalled Lenin. 43 \nNot that Lenin lived a life that was normal for most inhabitants of \nthe Soviet republic.45 \nTHE FORMULATION OF POLICIES \nThe political symbiosis of Lenin the Bolshevik and Spiridonova the \nLeft Socialist Revolutionary laid a premium on the rapid promulga-\ntion of a Basic Land Law. Peasants and Bolsheviks had tolerated \neach other in late 1917, and the Decree on Land had been well \nreceived. A system of direct, \nprogressive taxation had been a Bolshevik aim in the pre-October \nmonths and D. The \nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries were nervous about peasant feelings \nand on 6 December the new tax law was amended to allow local \nsoviets to exempt the poorer sections of the population from all \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntaxation. The Left Socialist Revolutionary \nA. Bolsheviks and Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries knew they had to reach a compromise loaded in \nfavour of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries if there was to be any \npoint in the continued coalition. Lenin's indefinite concept of 'model \nfarms' was quietly shelved; and, for a while, the Bolshevik leftists \nwere induced to refrain from mass collectivisation.49 \nThis title signified that nationalisation was no longer a Bolshevik \nshort-term aim. The Bolsheviks had \nwanted to base transfers of property to a greater extent with an \nincrease of productivity in mind; but the need to reconcile their \npartners in Sovnarkom forced them to give way. This meant that Bolshevism also had to forgo an \ninsistence on retention of the large estates in integral form; and that \nthe agricultural wage labourers, as distinct from poor peasants, were \nnot supported as strongly as the Bolsheviks had originally desired. 52 \nLenin won a few minor battles. 54 The return to \ntheir native villages of hundreds of thousands of peasant conscripts, \nwhose acquaintance with the Bolshevik programme was closer than \nthat of the normal rural population, made little difference. 55 Sovnarkom desisted from com pre-\n The Obscene Peace \n315 \nhensive forcible requisitioning, and Lenin's occasional talk of an anti-\nspeculator terror was not yet a systematic and lasting policy. 56 \nThe Bolshevik inclination towards using violence against the \npeasantry, which is traceable to the manipulative attitude to \npeasants traditional in Bolshevik thought,57 was emerging, but the \narmy which would be necessary to suppress peasant discontent, was \nnot yet formed. Sovnarkom encouraged demobilisation of several \nregiments in late 1917. The pre-October commitment to demilitaris-\ning industrial production and switching to output for the civilian \nmarket was also being fulfilled; and Sverdlov engineered the closure \nof Bolshevik party committees in the Russian army on the Eastern \nfront. 58 Yet military conflict, in civil war and in foreign anti-\nBolshevik crusades, was expected. \nOn 14 December 1917, Lenin and the People's Commissar of \nFinances, G.60 Six weeks later, on 21 January 1918, the Soviet authorities \nunilaterally annulled the foreign and domestic loans incurred by \nNikolai II and the Provisional Government.62 \nLenin and his colleagues breathed fire about the future fate of \ncapitalism and capitalists.63 A state-managed industrial sector seemed \nto most Bolshevik leaders the cure for this problem. Before October \n1917, Lenin had sketched a process of gradual nationalisation, 64 and \nsubsequently convinced associates that caution was needed in the \nwinter of 1917-1918 despite the impatience of Bukharin and other \nleftists. But Bukharin and Osinski pressed for the creation of a \ngeneral body to co-ordinate the process and obtained Lenin's \nconsent.66 \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Council's ameliorative impact on the industry and trade was \nnegligible. Even Lenin was \naccepting the sober predictions of his associate, V. Milyutin, \nbefore October 1917.68 There were still Bolsheviks who drew up \nplans for a perfectly-functioning system of complete economic \nmanagement, as Lenin irritably noted. 70 Bolshevik leftists, who combined arch-centralism of \noutlook with demands for uninhibited power for workers' represen-\ntatives on the shop floor, denounced this as a betrayal. Few Bolsheviks objected when Aleksandr Shlyapnikov was \nappointed commissar with extra-legal powers to restore an opera-\ntional network. \nThis menacing condescension had been largely, but not wholly, \nsubmerged in Bolshevik pronouncements before October 1917. The Bolshevik leaders did not \nenjoy the compulsion they were applying to the working class; they \nassumed that, in time, the workers would understand the require-\nments of the situation and would support the party. 73 Lenin's old adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nstrongly disapproved of what he regarded a a premature attempt at \nthe transition to socialism; and the dispersal of the Constituent \nAssembly appalled him.74 And skilled \nand literate workers assumed positions in the administration of the \nyoung Soviet state. \nTHE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN DISPUTE \nLenin's restlessness with Trotski's tactic of 'neither war nor peace' \ngrew sharply in 1918. On 7 January, a day after the Constituent \nAssembly's closure and six days after the assassination attempt, the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders conferred while Trotski briefly took leave from \nBrest-Litovsk. The terms offered to the Soviet delegation by \nGermany and Austria-Hungary, especially the proposal that the \narmies of the Central Powers would maintain their occupation in \nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic region, had provoked a furious \nreaction in the local committees of the Bolshevik party.77 \nOn 8 January, Lenin could ascertain the strength of the internal \nparty opposition when he addressed sixty three leaders of the \nBolshevik fraction to the Third Congress of Soviets of Workers', \nSoldiers' and Cossacks' Deputies. Only \nfifteen voted in favour of Lenin's proposal: a massive defeat. And yet he \n 318 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad eventually won the struggle for participation. 'In any event,' \nLenin argued with Trotski, 'I stand for the immediate signature of \npeace, it is more secure. '82 \nThe crucial arena for debate among Bolsheviks was the Central \nCommittee. Undeterred by defeat at the Congress of Soviets \nfractional gathering, Lenin restated his case on 11 January. But it would give time for the \nBolsheviks to 'strangle' the Russian bourgeoisie and to prepare an \narmy for a future revolutionary war- he made no pretence of being a \npacifist.86 Lenin was obviously not the only Bolshevik leader who \ncould point to another Bolshevik leader's past failings. Dzierzynski \nwent further: Lenin was doing in international relations what \nZinoviev and Kamenev, the so-called revolutionary 'black-legs', \nhad done in domestic policy in the October Revolution.90 This attitude was \nconfirmed by a joint session of the Bolshevik and Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Central Committees on 13 January.91 \nOn l February, the Bolshevik Central Committee reconvened.95 Their anti-Lenin \narguments were not as unequivocal as they might have been.96 \nAt Brest-Litovsk, time was running out for the Soviet delegation. Lenin urged \na rapid reconvening of the peace talks and, if the Germans were still \nwilling, the signature of a treaty on the terms specified in December \n1917. And yet Trotski \n 320 \nLenin: A Political Life \nadamantly refused to accede to a separate peace until the German \noffensive had happened (and even until it became clear whether the \nworking classes of the Central Powers would rise against an invasion \nof the Soviet republic). 98 Lenin had come within inches of political victory in \nthe Central Committee.99 \nLenin's forensic and philosophical skills were tugging the Central \nCommittee closer towards him. Lenin's \ncomment to the leftists was mordant: 'History will say that you \ngave away the revolution. He stuck to \nofficial Bolshevik policy as expressed before the October Revolution. Lenin had \nachieved his long-pursued majority in the Central Committee. 102 Trotski was now \non Lenin's side. Nerves of steel would still be required; nobody in the \nBolshevik Central Committee knew whether the Central Powers, \nonce their armies had started moving and found the resistance to be \nso feeble, would agree to halt. The \nrespective policies of Lenin and Trotski, mutually contradictory, had \nto be reassessed. \nLenin, while suspecting him of posturing, declined to respond. 105 Lenin was horrified and threatened to \nleave Sovnarkom and the Central Committee: 'These terms must be \nsigned.' 106 Lomov struck back: 'It is \n 322 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnecessary to take power without V. [Lenin].'107 \nBut Lenin could see he would win. 109 Yet Lenin's victory was \ncomplete in the Central Committee. \nPARTY POLEMICIST \nVital as it was to control the Central Committee, however, Lenin did \nnot yet control the entire political system: the various organs of \npower were rivals to each other. \nThe Bolsheviks, wanting results at almost any cost, heeded little \nabout the means. Soviets, trade unions, factory-workshop commit-\ntees, and party organs: these were infused with Bolshevik personnel \nwho were instructed to get on with the job at hand.110 Such an attitude was operable so long as \ntwo major conditions were met: firstly, that the Bolsheviks in the \nvarious public institutions were more or less agreed on policy; and \nsecond, that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were not at variance \nwith the Bolsheviks. Naturally this \npushed leading Bolsheviks back into the central body where they \ncould resolve their own disagreements on policy definitively and \nwithout interference from other parties. While the battle raged in the \nCentral Committee, Bolsheviks at lower levels was riven by conflict. \nLenin recognised that the central party leadership's authority was not \nlimitless and that further struggles would be necessary if the party \nwas to follow the newly-adopted central policy. Lenin had not written such a message \nto Plekhanov in the dispute of 1900. Only Trotski \ncame near to him in prestige as a pre-eminent Soviet statesman; but \neven Trotski could have no claim to recognition as the Bolshevik \nparty chief. There was talk among them of dropping \nLenin from the government and even of imprisoning him if this alone \nwould guarantee the retention of a policy hostile to a separate peace. This is not to say that Lenin was \n 324 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincapable of being irresponsible; several of his policy proposals in \n1917 were cases in point. But his international policy of 1918 came \nout well in comparison with the suggestions of his Left Communist \nopponents. \nLenin also had the advantage of possessing a strong group in the \ncentral party apparatus. Sverdlov, after an initial inclination towards \nrevolutionary war, sided with Lenin. 116 Organisational manipulation was not the only reason for the \nadvance of the Leninists before the Party Congress. 118 His proven skills as a polemicist made Lenin, who had \nalways had a soft spot for 'Grisha', forgive everything that had \nhappened between them in October 1917. 123 \nMany Bolshevik opponents experienced inhibitions in attacking him. Safarov denied that Lenin's faction were \ndescribable as 'collaborators' with imperialism. 126 The sheer impracticality of the Left Communists, \nas they were becoming known, played into Lenin's hands. 127 In addi-\ntion, there could be no revolutionary war if only the local Bolshevik \ncommittee members were in favour of fighting it. Left Communists, as Bolshevik radicals, would \nnormally have turned first to the workers. 129 \nIt is against this background that the swing towards Lenin has to \nbe assessed. A survey of town and city soviets at the beginning of \nJanuary 1918 revealed an anti-Lenin majority, but in subsequent \nweeks the balance of opinion steadily changed. Their commitment to intra-\nparty democracy was no firmer than Lenin's. Without Lenin, the Brest-Litovsk \ntreaty would probably not have been signed; and the Germans might \nwell have invaded all Russia. But Lenin had a tide of mass opinion \nrunning his way, and no Russian politician knew better how to \nexploit his advantages. 133 \nThe second (and penultimate) day started with Lenin's political \nreport. Lenin analysed 'the extraordinary ease' of the party's \n'triumphal procession' to power in 1917. 134 Success, according to \nLenin, had been possible only because 'international imperialism' \nwas temporarily distracted from intervening in Russia. 135 In 1918 the \nBolsheviks faced not the ineffective 'bands of Kerenski' but the might \nof Germany. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks \nwould have to retreat. Just as Lenin's Bolshevik followers had \nswallowed their pride by participating in Stolypin's emasculated \nThird State Duma in 1907, so now they ought to conclude a \nseparate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bolshevik leftists were like the Polish noblemen of \nformer times who died in a beautiful pose, saying: 'Peace is a \ndisgrace, war is honour. Lenin was lucky to face such opponents. \nLenin was gambling on obtaining a lengthy breathing space, on the \nGermans abiding by their word, on the inability of the two military \ncoalitions in the War to come together to strangle the young Soviet \nrepublic in its cradle. So \n 328 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwhy bend the knee to the German high command at Brest-Litovsk. Uritski noted sarcastically that \nLenin would sign a separate peace even if it was destined to last only \na couple of days. 144 Like other Bolshevik leftists, Uritski was \nhorrified both by the compulsory evacuation of the recently-\nconquered Ukraine and by the compulsory demobilisation of the \nRussian army.oftoday \nwas simply Lenin's of yesterday. This was a polemical opportunity \nthat would not have been missed by Lenin if the roles had been \nreversed. 150 The fissures on the party's left \nimpeded a unified assault on Lenin; and Sverdlov felt no need to \nration the contributions from the leftists. 153 \nTrotski also helped Lenin by declaring contempt for the leftist plan \nfor partisan warfare conducted with 'the knives of Pskov peasants' \ninstead of rifles and artillery. Ryazanov was less charitable \nto Lenin's group, accusing Sverdlov of closing down the party's \norganisations in the old army solely in order to make it harder for the \nparty to resist the proposal for a separate peace. Maskov, a Urals \ndelegate, came over to Lenin's side despite having been mandated \nto advocate revolutionary war. 160 Debate was ended, and \nBukharin's closing speech predicted that the 'breathing space' would \nnot be realised and that Lenin would soon have to adopt the position \nof the Bolshevik left. 165 Trotski \nignored him and proceeded to offer amendments to Lenin's motion. And where Lenin had spoken generally about \na breathing-space before 'the attack of the imperialists', Trotski \nwanted to mention 'the inevitable and imminent attack'. The motion called for 'the most energetic, \nmercilessly decisive and draconian measures to raise the self-\ndiscipline and discipline of the workers and peasants of Russia'; it \ndeclared that 'a liberationist, patriotic socialist war' was unavoidable, \nand that universal military training should be put in hand. 168 The \nCongress therefore decided to pass Lenin's resolution but to withhold \nit from publication. Lenin held himself aloof from the wrangling. The \nepisode gave further reinforcement to Lenin's position as patriarch of \nhis party. Lenin \ngave a joint report on two further issues: the revision of the party \nprogramme and the change of the party's name. His aim was to \nincorporate sections in the programme to highlight the differences \nbetween the Bolsheviks and most other adherents of the Second \nInternational. Lenin, denouncing 'bourgeois democratism', called for a \nnew type of democracy based on the Russian soviets. Lenin, emphasising that the Bolsheviks were \nstili 'only at the first transitional phase between capitalism and \nsocialism', wanted to retain the old proposals. Lenin's \nvague references to the nationalisation of the means of production \nlacked the necessary concreteness. 178 When debate shifted to the \nquestion of the party's name, however, Bukharin spoke strongly on \nLenin's side; and the Congress voted to redesignate the party as the \n 332 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRussian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in order to distinguish it \nfrom other Marxist parties in Russia and elsewhere. Trotski's success signalled his meteoric rise in the \nBolshevik party. 184 \nLenin, despite his brave face, knew that troubles remained in store \nfor the Soviet republic. \nConflicts between the peasantry and the local soviets were intensi-\nfied. State institutions and power, shaken in the February Revolution \nagainst Emperor Nikolai II and paralysed throughout the Provi-\nsional Government's rule, had not recovered its previous control over \nsociety even though the Bolsheviks had used violence on a vast scale. \nAnd in south-eastern Russia, the Socialist Revolutionaries were \nmustering to establish an alternative Russian government consisting \n The Obscene Peace \n333 \nof deputies from the dispersed Constituent Assembly. Anti-Bolshevik \nregimes had sprung up in the Transcaucasus and counter-revolu-\ntionary armies were being formed in south Russia and Siberia to \noverthrow Sovnarkom. \nIf anyone could lead the fight against the regime's enemies it was \nVladimir Ilich Lenin. He sought \ninfluence among Marxists. He did not control the Bolshevik faction \nand, in the First World War, his contacts with its members in the \nRussian empire became extremely frail and intermittent. \nNevertheless, at the level of political philosophy, he markedly \ninfluenced his own Bolsheviks even though they objected to his \ndivisive tirades; and, as often as not, it was Lenin who set the agenda \nfor Bolshevik debates even if he did not always win them. He had \nthe inestimable advantage that the maintenance of a foreign-based \napparatus was important for Bolsheviks in the Russian empire. Thus \nthe Okhrana, by arresting revolutionaries and severely constricting \nthe freedoms of the illegal labour movement, made a Lenin possible. \nAnd so he survived, acquiring the prestige of a veteran and a major \nthinker among Bolsheviks. His \nMarxism evinced a fanaticism which was common in varying degrees \namong Bolsheviks - and it was alloyed with non-Marxist doctrines \nand impulses which he did not acknowledge. Bolshevism was not the \n 334 \nLenin: A Political Life \noriginator of all ideas of dictatorship. The idea that the oppressive \ntsarist order should be followed immediately by an order which \nforeswore authoritarianism had a long tradition in Russian revolu-\ntionary attitudes before the Bolsheviks existed; and it was not \nconfined to the Russian empire either. On many questions of Russian politics and \neconomics, furthermore, he developed ideas which were combatively \nexpressed. When he insisted that the Bolsheviks should address the \nnational question, he took risks with his own reputation among \nthem. \nSuch debates could have dragged on interminably if the monarchy \nhad not suddenly been overthrown in February 1917. It was this \nrevolution that made Lenin, for the first time, into a figure in world \npolitics. Lenin, for most of his opponents outside the \nBolshevik party, was the October Revolution. Multitudes of revolutions had occurred in the old \nRussian empire in 1917, and Lenin had always said that they were \neasily compatible. \nLenin's policies misjudged the enormity of the old Russian em-\npire's crisis. \nAnd so a broadly-based socialist government did not take place in \nlate 1917. The chances of the prolonged survival of such a regime, \nlinking Bolsheviks with Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, \nhad never been large; but Lenin was prominent in preventing the \nattempt from being made. Lenin still hoped against \nhope that Russian workers and peasants would 'from below' make a \nmass participatory system and that European socialist revolution \nwould occur. And yet it was far from being obvious in \nMarch 1918 that Lenin would be able to secure his Soviet state in \npower and live to pursue his plans for socialist revolution in Russia \nand the rest of the world.", "Bolshevik_Rule_1919": " The decrees of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War must not \nbe treated as an accurate gauge of reality. Nor were Lenin and his colleagues \npusillanimous in the exercise of repression. Merciless struggle, \nmonolithic unity and and the strictest discipline were catch-phrases \nof Bolshevik public life. \nThere can equally be no doubt that the Bolsheviks were violent on a \nmassive scale even if not as comprehensively as was their officially-\nstated intention. After the Eighth Party \nCongress, Lenin and his colleagues informed local Bolshevik bodies \nthat an 'extraordinarily threatening danger' was posed from the east. The White army fled in chaotic fashion and mid-Siberia \nwas returned to Bolshevik rule. He gave orders that any future official \nexplanation should suggest that local Bolsheviks were responding to a \nlocal emergency.4 To the Eastern front political commissars, fighting \nKolchak, Lenin had written on 29 May 1919: 'If we haven't conquered \nthe Urals by the winter, I consider the doom of the Revolution \ninevitable. Lenin gave way, but not before precious time was lost in \nsecuring Petrograd's defences.9 \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nEarlier spats had occurred among Politburo members; but Lenin had \navoided involvement. Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. Lenin, with reservations but also with decisiveness, took \nthe side of Stalin and Zinoviev. Nevertheless Lenin would not go all the way with Stalin. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July. On 3 July, as the Bolshevik Central Committee was having \nits frantic meeting in the capital, Denikin issued his Moscow Directive. He was 350 kilometres from Moscow, \nand Lenin was not minded to deflect manpower to protect Petrograd. \nThe Bolsheviks and their Red Army, almost to their own surprise, had \npulled off victory in the main theatre of conflict over the Russian \nempire. Lenin celebrated enthusiastically. The bulk of the population also lived under \nBolshevik rule. Very well, then: Bolshevik propaganda should be \ndiverted towards attracting their support. But they and Lenin had no illusions \nabout each other. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. There were plenty \nof them, and Lenin's misjudgement about Petrograd was simply the \none he was personally and primarily responsible for. But he had made \nfewer than most of his colleagues; and those, like Kamenev, who \nforesaw difficulties more clearly than he, would never have led the \nBolsheviks to the party's satisfaction. \nGATHERING THE LANDS \nIt had been the ending of the Great War rather than any success \nagainst the Whites that had first brought Lenin and his colleagues back \nto deliberations on the 'national question' in the former Russian \nempire. The \nConstitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (or \nRSFSR) drawn up in summer 1918 was extremely unspecific; and even \ndebate at the Eighth Party Congress had avoided specifying what \nrelations were to be pursued among the various republics. The creation of \nindependent Soviet republics had been initiated by Lenin. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Otherwise, \nLenin added, the troops of the Reds would not be treated as \n'liberators'. In \nthe winter of 1918-1919, Adolfloffe was sent to Belorussia to persuade \nlocal Bolsheviks that the RSFSR's interest would be served by a line of \n'buffer republics' between itself and powerful states to the west. 25 Their \nimmediate re-incorporation into an undisguisedly Moscow-based state \nmight instigate an even more British and French anti-Bolshevik \ncrusade than at present. Lenin kept a rein on policy. Leading local \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n93 \nBolsheviks in each Soviet republic were not easily reconciled to their \nown declarations of independence.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Without Lenin's \nassistance, they could not conquer their own countries. The policy of \nLenin, Stalin and Trotski had therefore to be accepted. Republics could have formal independence only so \nlong as republic party bodies were strictly controlled by the Central \nCommittee and its Politburo in Moscow.29 \nThat a close formal link between the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics (and not just between party bodies) should be forged had \nbeen decided, but was not announced. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia.30 \nEvidently Lenin did not want to be seen as an initiator. The fiction of \nnon-intervention by Moscow in non-Russian affairs had to be \nmaintained. For example, the Politburo on 23 \nApril 1919 resolved to ask the Ukrainian Bolshevik leadership to \nascertain how best 'a fusion of Ukraine with Soviet Russia might be \narranged'.31 Such language indicated that Lenin was yielding now to \nthe arguments of the Stuckas and the Mickeviciuses. \nFurthermore, the Bolsheviks in command of the other republics were \nnot always sensitive to national traditions - and often they carried \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthrough measures in total defiance of local society.32 For example, the \nUkrainian Bolsheviks had harassed the so-called middle peasantry and \ntried, in places, to impose collective farming by force. Consequently \nLenin may well have judged greater centralisation of authority to be \nless risky than letting the local Bolshevik-led governments enjoy much \nautonomy. Not that Lenin ever needed great encouragement to \ncentralise.33 \nUkrainian Bolshevik consent was also to be sought; and yet, even \nbefore treaty documents were signed, Lenin approved a directive to the \nparty leadership in Kiev stipulating that 'the People's Commissars of \nthe RSFSR should become People's Commissars of the Union with the \nPeople's Commissariats of Ukraine as their regional plenipotenti-\naries'. \nConsultations proceeded with Bolsheviks in the other republics. \nInstead, on 1 June 1919, a draft resolution was taken from Lev \nKamenev at the Politburo in favour of a 'military-economic union' of \nRussia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Belorussia. The Politburo controlled the entire \nparty and, despite occasions of serious disobedience, the Civil War \nwitnessed a strong insistence of authority on local Bolsheviks and \nconsequently on republic governments. In August 1919 Christian \nRakovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian Sovnarkom, was brusquely \nordered by the Politburo to close down several People's Commissariats \nand to dispense with a Ukrainian Council of Defence and Labour.36 A \ncontrast is sometimes drawn between Lenin and Stalin on basic aspects \nof the national question. Lenin liked to finesse the appearance \nof policy to a greater extent than Stalin. Typically he \nwrote an open letter on 28 December 1919 stating that it was up to the \nworkers and peasants of Ukraine to determine 'exactly what federative \nlink' to have with Soviet Russia. But Lenin was disingenuous. Naturally he had no \nobjections to particular further measures which increased the power \nof Moscow vis-a-vis the republics. Since the \nbeginning of 1918 it had been party policy to set up administrative \nenclaves wherever a non-Russian nationality lived in large numbers. It was \nplanned by Stalin's Commissariat as early as 18 March 1918, but the \nbattles with the Whites in the Volga region and the Urals rendered it \nimpracticable for a whole year. 38 \nFurthermore, the Tartars against the expectations of the Bolsheviks \nproved to be aggressively self-assertive. As if this was not enough, the \nexiguous Bolshevik cadres in the Tartar-inhabited lands could not be \ncounted on to support the formation of a Tartar Republic along the \nmodel of Bashkiria. The Politburo resolved on 13 December 1919 that \nonly with their sanction would the republic be established.40 \nThe basic problem was that, as the Mensheviks had warned the \nBolsheviks before 1917, the former Russian empire was a quilt of \ninterstitched nationalities. No single ethnic group lived alone in a \nclearly demarcated zone; and, as often as not, the attempt to designate \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch zones aggravated inter-ethnic tensions. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. Mirsaid Sultan \nGaliev, a rare Bolshevik from Tataria, had come to believe in the \nnecessity of a huge Turkic-speaking socialist state being carved out of \nthe Russian empire, larger even than the ill-fated Tartar-Bashkir \nRepublic. He also wanted aspects of Islam to be grafted on Bolshevik \nthought.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. In addition, the non-Bolshevik members of the \nBashrevkom proved even more intractable in 1920 than in 1918-\n1919. Some who rebelled against Sovnarkom were put under arrest \nand, on Stalin's recommendation, transferred to Moscow prisons. \nOnly Lenin seriously opposed him. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. A \nclash between Lenin and Stalin might be postponed, but not \npermanently avoided. Just once Lenin took a trip to \nanother Russian city after the capital's transfer to Moscow in February \n1918: this was his sojourn in Petrograd in July 1920 for the start of the \nSecond Congress of the Communist Internationa1.48 Lenin had no \nmetropolitan prejudice. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters. Lenin \nand his sister Mariya were being driven by chauffeur Gil to the \nSokolniki district on the outskirts of Moscow to visit his wife \nKrupskaya. Lenin was not \ncompletely intimidated. Lenin had further humiliation in store. They sought mercy on the grounds that they had assumed \nthey were robbing someone calling himself Levin rather than Lenin. After all, the Bolshevik \nparty was committed to the eradication of anti-semitism (and, although \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n99 \nthe fact was not bruited, Lenin was anyway part-Jewish by descent). Lenin joked about his surrender of pistol \nand wallet to the gang in terms borrowed from the lexicon of Marxism: \n'Such a compromise was akin to our compromise with the bandits of \nGerman imperialism. '59 \nYet his interference was limited mainly to emergencies; he recognised \nthat Trotski, Stalin and other Bolshevik commissars at the fronts had \nto take decisions without automatic detailed consultation with \nMoscow. Lenin was the motor of the political machinery. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms.60 \nLenin habitually chaired Politburo sessions. Lenin's colleagues appear \nto have treated them as reassurance that someone in the Kremlin cared \nabout them and their work. It was in the \ncollegiate deliberations of the People's Commissars that Lenin \nmanaged to put flesh on the bone of Politburo decisions. Sovnarkom's decrees gained in importance; and Lenin \nensured that the Politburo's wishes were not merely sanctioned but also \nelaborated before public announcement.62 \nIn an average day, which was extremely busy, Lenin sought to \nimpose the Politburo's will on a state which was woefully chaotic \ndespite its aspirations. A source of greater irritation was his \npractice of doing things through the Politburo even when there were \nenough Central Committee members currently in Moscow to make a \nquorum; but nothing was done about this until the end of 1920 (when \nPolitburo members were in dispute with each other).6s But Lenin was among several \ncentral party colleagues who insisted. Lenin's refusal of \ntitles, awards and celebrations was to some extent a self-regarding \ntactic. Lenin was genuinely devoid of vanity. Lenin was a fellow of simple habits. He went shooting in the forests with leading Bolsheviks. His only friends were Bolsheviks. \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNearly all were comrades rather than friends. \nEXPORT OF REVOLUTION, SIEGE ECONOMY \nThe activities of Lenin and his associates in 1919 demonstrate that, \nafter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the party still adhered to its objective \nof European socialist revolution.66 \nLenin also wished to supply military assistance to the extent that the \nRed Army was capable.68 He and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership had been \nequally cheered by the communist seizure of power in Munich. It was beginning to look as if the \npredictions made by Lenin in 1917 were coming true.'69 \nAlready, however, the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics \nappeared fragile, and Lenin sensed that the Hungarian comrades were \ntoo reckless for their own good. Lenin defended his \ncolleagues; but the sole counsel he could give was as follows: 'Hold on \nfor all you are worth, and ours shall be the victory.'74 \nLenin was wrong about this: the Hungarian Soviet Republic was \noverthrown by late August and Bela Kun fled to Moscow. Yet Lenin \nwas right in his caution about international relations in the Baltic \nregion. Not only did he and Chicherin aim to avoid giving offence to \nthe Allies; they also strained to minimise the involvement of the \nindependent states in the anti-Bolshevik military operations of the year. The matter came before the Politburo on II September, and \nit took all the pressure that Lenin could muster to secure a decision to \nend the condition of war with Latvia and Lithuania as well as with \nFinland. Lenin's \ndifficulty lay in countering the arguments of the 'native' communist \nleaders of the Baltic region who wanted to keep their respective \ncountries on the agenda of revolutionary expansion. But Lenin pulled \nthe Politburo to his pragmatic viewpoint. 76 Chicherin opposed on the grounds that such a policy \nwould destroy the impression, eagerly cultivated by Soviet diplomacy, \nthat the Russian republic was uninterested in extending socialism to \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nforeign states on the point of a bayonet. Initially he had \nLenin's support.78 But subsequently Lenin agreed with Trotski that \nYudenich should not only be driven back from Petrograd but also be \nsought out and liquidated as a military force. A breach in the wall of \ninternational capitalism, Lenin felt, had been obtained. \nThrough summer 1919 Lenin kept a discreet silence about Allied \nintentions.82 \nJust as he had not highlighted the danger from the Allies in mid-\n1919, so Lenin eschewed any welcome for the lifting of the blockade. But he \nwished also to make maximum use of the situation: the official policy \nof Sovnarkom in 1918 to seek concessionnaires abroad to sink capital \ninto Russian industry was resumed. Precisely this was said by Lenin in \nan interview with the Christian Science Monitor in September 1919.84 Nevertheless, knowing the unpopularity \nof concessions and being busy with a thousand other duties, Lenin left \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n105 \nit to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade to draw up a detailed \nplan in January.86 \nSo what on earth was Lenin up to. His commitment to European \nsocialist revolution, strong as it was, was subsumed under the priority \nfor the survival of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. Lenin perceived that \nthe punitive terms of the treaty of Versailles could not but help the \ncause of the Communist International in Germany. Lenin was a stealthy, sinuous politician. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. He emphasised the role to be played by the trade unions as a \ncounterweight to the Bolshevik party.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. Militarisation of labour, for Lenin, was a regrettable necessity \nand not a policy to glory in. Grain requisitioning was the cornerstone of \nBolshevik wartime policy: the idea that a private market in wheat and \nrye might return was anathema to the party's leaders. He never ceased to believe \nthat the Central Committee had been wrong to reject his proposal, and \ntook a bitter pleasure a year later when his persecutor Lenin instigated \na reform of food-supplies policy remarkably similar to his own. 104 But \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \non this occasion Trotski did not fight his corner. Lenin had won the \ndebate, and Trotski chose to concentrate on his work in the Red Army \nand areas of economic policy where he could get Lenin to compromise \nwith him. Surveys carried out in the mid-1920s were to show \nthat the great majority of the Russian population remained Christian \nby belief; and the Bolsheviks knew that in the peripheral zones of the \nold empire - in the Ukraine, the Baltic region, Georgia and Armenia -\ndevotion to national denominations had been unaltered by the calls of \nthe party to abandon the faith. Most citizens of the Soviet republic ruled \nover by the godless Lenin were believers. His Land Decree at the Second Congress of \nSoviets had expropriated all the landed property of the Russian \nOrthodox Church, and his Basic Law on the Socialisation of the Land \nin February 1918 had confirmed this_l 06 The intention was that, by \nundermining the economic resources of religious institutions, popular \nbelief in God (or god, as Lenin put it) would be foreshortened. Lenin on 23 January \n1918 signed a Decree on the Separation of the Church from the State \nand School from the Church. Lenin \nappreciated the potential of the Patriarchate as a focus for anti-\nBolshevik opposition. On 20 October \n1918, at the First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers, he argued \nthat excessive zeal in the extirpation of 'religious prejudices' would be \ncounterproductive. 112 At the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919 he suggested that the Bolsheviks would merely give rise to \nfanaticism if offence was given to the beliefs of Christians. Lenin was \ncunning. 114 It is highly improbable that Lenin strongly disapproved.' 116 \n 110 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Russian Orthodox Church was the one remaining institution \ncapable of rallying most ethnic Russians against Sovnarkom and was \nsingled out for maltreatment by the Cheka. 120 Lenin's attentiveness was little greater \ntowards Islam. On 20 November 1917 he and Stalin had co-signed a \nproclamation to 'all labouring Moslems of Russia and the East' which \nguaranteed their freedom to worship; 121 Lenin also warned at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919 against offending Muslim \nsensibilities, and declared that the influence of the mullahs in central \nAsia was even greater than the influence of priests in Russia. But one factor must surely come \ninto the reckoning: this is that the Bolsheviks were already regarded by \nmany Russian Orthodox Christians as a gang of marauding Jews. Almost certainly Lenin did not want to inflame Russian \npopular opinion by siding too openly with religious believers who did \nnot belong to Russia's national church. His decrees of 1917 and the \nSoviet Constitution of July 1918 had promulgated freedom of \nconscience in the Soviet republic. \nIn Lenin's defence it could be said that religious persecution was not \nconfined to the actions of the Reds. 125 \nNor was he the most avid advocate of militant atheism among the \nBolshevik party leaders. 26 Lenin won the day. Even so, he continued to \nhave to protect his position against Bolsheviks with ideas more extreme \nthan his own. But Lenin had yet to determine \nhow his government should tackle the question of religion. He sensed a particular \npotential menace in the growing attractiveness of the works of the ex-\nBolshevik Aleksandr Bogdanov (whom Lenin since 1908 had charged \nwith the 'heinous' offence of philosophical idealism) to some of his \nclose party co11eagues. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism.' 133 In fact the Bolsheviks had yet again been \nmisinformed. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But he urged that Bolsheviks in the \nmeantime should look on the bright side and get on with 'the peaceful \ntasks of economic construction'. 136 \nNikolai Krestinski followed Lenin with the Central Committee's \norganisational report. Kaganovich pleaded for greater \ncentralist severity did the tirades against Lenin relent. 151 But Lenin \nrepaid Trotski's assistance to him. He also quoted from his 1918 \npamphlet The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. 163 Lenin had less reason to thank his \ncolleagues in the other section. 164 His demarche was a \nreminder that even the more cautious Bolsheviks were yet Bolshe-\nviks: Milyutin overlooked peasant attitudes to nationalisation. 165 At this point Lenin, who had \nheard of the spat only the night before, intervened against Milyutin \nwhom he accused of being impractical and ignorant of Lenin's ideas. But it was an accurate assessment of Lenin's status: the Congress \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreversed the section's choice and took Krestinski's draft theses as the \nbasis of its resolution. 167 \nTrotski momentarily took a leaf out of Lenin's book and avoided \nunnecessary controversy. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. Lenin was unconcerned that \nleaders closer to Trotski than to him -\nA. Sergeev: each of them preferred Lenin \nto Trotski. \nLenin confidently roused the Congress with his final oration. Finishing his remarks on the \neconomy, Lenin triumphantly proclaimed: 'We shall manage to resolve \nthis problem just as victoriously as we resolved the military problem, \nand shall proceed quickly and firmly to the victory of the Worldwide \nSocialist Soviet Republic.", "Bolshevik_Rule_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. Every Central \nCommittee member approved this with reluctance, taking it for granted \nthat a resurgence of private commerce would strengthen the social \nforces in the country hostile to the Bolsheviks. Unease and irritation were expressed in \ndozens of written queries passed up to Lenin at the Tenth Party \nCongress. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. Connoisseurs of his style were able to recall that in 1918, despite \nhaving being the protagonist of a separate peace treaty with Germany \nand Austria-Hungary, he insisted that others in the Bolshevik party \nleadership should go out to Brest-Litovsk to do the signing. 5 \nLenin was in the chair. The \nparty monopolised power not only in theory but also in reality; the \nsupreme issue on the agenda of Soviet politics was not to be devolved \nto the formal state authorities until policy had been fixed by the \nBolshevik leadership. 10 Lenin was staying \nout of the highlight. 13 \nThus the potential region of greatest grain surplus in the Soviet-ruled \nrepublics was to be exempted from Lenin's reform. The antagonism of \nthe Ukraine-based Bolshevik leadership, already expressed at the Tenth \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nParty Congress, may have had an influence; 14 but probably Kamenev \nand his colleagues- with Lenin in agreement in the background- were \nthemselves worried about a resurgence of Ukrainian private trade \nbefore the completion of the transfer of land from gentry and rich \npeasants. The \nBolshevik party's fear of kulak-led resistance to its authority was so \nstrong that even the Ukrainian equivalent of the committees of the \nvillage poor, abolished in Russia in December 1918, remained in \nexistence until the mid-1920s. \nBolshevik leaders before and during the Party Congress had considered \nideas on reform limited to bartering between the peasant producer and \nboth the state procurer and the individual consumer; private traders \nhad not been envisaged.t 8 \nStill Lenin kept his head down. Lenin was lying low. There was conflict between the People's Commissariat of \nFood Supplies and the Central Statistical Administration in the \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n189 \nestimation of the grainstocks available; and Lenin, with his expertise in \nthe geography of agriculture going back to his 1899 book The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia, was naturally drawn into \narbitrating. Antonov-Ovseenko, sent by the \nPolitburo as political commissar to suppress the Tambov peasant \nrevolt, wrote to Lenin in alarm at the quota assigned to the local \nauthorities.27 The reform was \ntherefore still a tremendous gamble by Lenin; it might cause more \nproblems than it solved. \nCONQUEST OF EMPIRE \nAt the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently Lenin had demanded a \nunion between workers and peasants.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved.35 Propa-\nganda would, Lenin hoped, eventually redress the discredit into which \nthe Bolshevik regime had fallen. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921.36 Armenians had followed the Azeri example in \nFebruary 1921. 37 The Bolsheviks had \nalienated the non-Russians to a lesser extent than had the Whites in \nprevious years; but this led no party leader to think that the 'national \nquestion' had been solved. On the contrary, the lands of the former \nRussian empire were seething with political unrest among the various \nnations and ethnic groups. \nThe conquest of the Transcaucasus had meant that the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic (or RSFSR), Ukraine and Belorussia \nwere joined as independent Soviet republics by Azerbaidzhan, Armenia \nand Georgia.38 But the preferred long-term ties \namong all six Soviet republics were not specified. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin.40 Lenin wished to form a \nfederation of Russia, Ukraine and other republics whereas Stalin \nwanted to incorporate these other republics in the RSFSR with rights \nof 'autonomy' of the type inaugurated with the Bashkir Republic in \n1919. To treat Ukraine in such a way, according \nto Lenin was 'chauvinism'.41 Russia and its Bolshevik leaders had to go \nout of their way to demonstrate their anti-nationalist credentials; and \nhe was annoyed that his nearest major ally in the party on these \nquestions had turned against him. Perhaps Stalin, unlike Lenin, was \nalso aiming to have as strong and large an RSFSR as possible so as to \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nact as a counterweight to a future Soviet Germany; but Lenin the \nRussian was less Russocentric than Stalin the Georgian, and he was \napparently untroubled about a Soviet federation in Central and \nEastern Europe which might not be dominated by Russia.45 Lenin could not count on defeating Stalin's \nconstitutional project in open party debate. \nNot that the affairs of the non-Russian nationalities were overlooked \nby Lenin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. On 14 April 1921 he sent an open letter to 'the \ncommunist comrades of Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan \nand the Mountain Republic' demanding that local conditions be \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n193 \nrespected. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. \nHis reasoning was not just that the region was predominantly agrarian \nor that Bolshevik rule was under threat. On 3 April 1921 a Politburo decision was taken to require \nthem to submit any treaties with Turkey to Moscow before \nratification. \nThus it came about that Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin's full support, \nsought to reinforce control over each republic by constraining them \nwithin a Transcaucasian Federation. \nLenin backed it in principle, yet deemed implementation premature. \nMyasnikyan, who had a leading role in the Armenian Bolshevik \nleadership, to appear at the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in \nDecember 1921 to demand the Transcaucasian Federation's creation. 53 \nStill there was no deliberation as to the permanent arrangements to \nbe made among the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and the proposed \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTranscaucasian Federation. Stalin wrote to Lenin on 13 January 1922 \nrepeating his commitment to the incorporation of all of them within \nthe RSFSR. Possibly he \nwas content to see the Transcaucasian Federation, which was \npromulgated despite Georgian Bolshevik resistance on 12 March, \ncome into existence before moving on to a grander constitutional \nproject. Clashes between the Central \nCommittee in Moscow and the Bolshevik politicians of Ukraine had \noccurred since 1918. 56 On 11 March 1922 the Ukrainian Politburo complained \nto the Central Committee in Moscow about a series of infringements of \nthe republic's rights as embodied in the treaty with the RSFSR.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party. The spats over the territorial limits of \nBashkiria in 1919 were followed by several others within the RSFSR; \nand, most notoriously, a menacing disturbance broke out between the \nAzerbaidzhani and Armenian Soviet republics over the ownership of \nNagorny Karabakh. In 1920 the Politburo had ruled in favour of \nArmenia, but in 1921 Nagorny Karabakh - despite being heavily \npopulated by Armenians- was handed to Azerbaidzhan.59 \nSooner or later, however, Stalin and Lenin would clash over Stalin's \nproject for 'autonomisation'. He \npromoted non-Russian Bolsheviks to high office.60 Furthermore, his duties as \nPeople's Commissar for Nationality Affairs left him in no doubt how \nfrail the Bolshevik party was in the non-Russian republics. Bolsheviks \nwere few in number, were usually disproportionately drawn from \nethnic Russians as well as from persons who had joined the party late \nin the Civil War.61 The arguments for letting republican Bolshevik \norganisations take full charge of their respective republics were not self-\nevident. To Stalin it must have seemed that Lenin had not thought out \na responsible party policy. The will to retain the peoples of the Soviet \nlands subject to the party's power and policies, by force if the need \narose, was common to both men. Stalin was therefore unprepared for \nthe intensity of Lenin's hostility when it revealed itself from autumn \n1922. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism.67 \nLenin also knew that nothing could be counted upon in advance. In \npublic he had argued, on 6 December 1920, that Russian participation \nin world trade was necessary for economic recovery everywhere.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921. \nZinoviev suffered the embarrassment of having 'black-legged' against \nthe Bolshevik party in the October Revolution; he over-compensated \nfor this in the Communist International by zeal for foreign socialist \nadventures (which may also explain the roisterings of his fellow alleged \nblack-leg Kamenev in London in 1920).72 At the time \nLenin did not comment. Lenin's diary in \nMarch was filled with considerations about the tax in kind, the \nGeorgian operation, the Kronstadt and Tambov revolts, the arrange-\nment of foreign concessions, the trade treaties, the Tenth Party \nCongress. \nThe episode shows how even Lenin did not control his colleagues \nover all policies. Equally Lenin's political distance from the March Action \ndemonstrates the intensity of his pre-occupation with the multifaceted \ncrisis confronting the Soviet state. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession.' The opposition, according to Lenin, \nwas supposedly motivated by 'Donbass patriotism'. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. On 10 \nOctober 1921 Lenin wrote to Trotski approvingly about the \nnegotiations in progress with the German high command. Soviet \nRussia was on the edge of the abyss. \nLenin unusually kept aloof from the debate among his colleagues. Lenin's favourite \nassertion that the Bolshevik party should focus on practical tasks and \nshould give up its chattering carried the implication that theorising \nshould be kept in the background.81 Yet Lenin \nfrequently tried to have his cake and eat it too. Lenin \npreferred to get on with government and to leave speculation to others. 'Left' and 'right' were no longer easily definable terms \namong Bolsheviks.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition.88 Even then, Lenin is recorded as having mentioned co-\nexistence without breathing anything about its being peaceful. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Lenin himself put \ninverted commas around 'co-habitation', thereby signalling his \nrecognition that an eventual violent clash between socialism and \ncapitalism was probable. The political \nirreconcilability of the Soviet regime and the capitalist West was a \nfoundation stone of his world-view. Toning down \nTrotski's presentation, Lenin at the Ninth Congress of Soviets \ncharacterised capitalism with the followint words: 'What has been \nachieved is a certain fragile equilibrium'. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen.92 \nTo Lenin's mind, trade links should be restored only if the gains of \nthe October Revolution and the Civil War were not damaged. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement. Lenin had been discussing only the regime's \nsurvival rather than the implementation of all the tasks described \nbefore October 1917 in The State and Revolution. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore. The \nCommunist International was not formally under Moscow's control \nand could go on conducting propaganda in its own name; and, of \ncourse, the treaty in no way stipulated a dismantlement of the so-called \ndictatorship of the proletariat in the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics. On the contrary, it was aimed at active party \nmembers in Moscow and the provinces. In elucidating his own \nintentions, Lenin had to work hard to keep fellow Bolsheviks on his \nside. \nIt was partly for this reason that, when calling for the discontinua-\ntion of earlier measures, Lenin chose to accentuate aspects of \n 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontinuity. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. Lenin repeated that the agreeing of \n'concessions' with foreign entrepreneurs would make an important \ncontribution to the resources of the Soviet state. But Lenin's \nwords involved, too, a deal of obfuscation. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. He \nforesaw the party's reluctance to abandon ultra-centralist state \neconomic intervention, and he wanted to disseminate the idea that \nthe New Economic Policy simply restored measures that had once had \nthe general concurrence of Bolsheviks. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. 104 \nLenin still wrote as a confident social engineer.' 106 He had largely \nstopped bothering with arguments put forward by non-Bolsheviks; but \non this occasion he considered the case against terror put by Martov \nthe Menshevik and Chernov the Socialist-Revolutionary.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. 'It is impossible to distinguish speculation from \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \n\"correct\" trade,' Lenin added, ' if speculation is to be understood in the \npolitico-economic sense. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'. \nHe recommended that leading members of People's Commissariats \nshould be transferred from Moscow to rural district soviets. But his remedy \nwas hopelessly inadequate; and, in recommending it, Lenin showed \nhimself to be out of touch with those many Bolshevik leaders who by \nnow enjoyed and wanted to prolong their life of privilege and power in \nthe capital. Bolsheviks had to buckle down to \ntheir own education: 'We must not be scared to admit that here there is \nstill much that can and must be learned from the capitalist.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. This was \nembarrassing for the Bolsheviks, who prided themselves on being the \n'vanguard' of the working class; but conditions in the towns could not \nbe improved until trade with the villages, which necessitated material \nincentives being given to the peasantry, was restored. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. Progress might be impeded, and it remained \nLenin's contention that it would take decades before socialism could be \nattained in Russia. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. The \nBolsheviks were few, but they were united: 'And we know what we \nwant. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. Opinion among \nMoscow Bolsheviks was very agitated; the City Party Committee \nsecretary P. 121 But Lenin, when he heard of \nthis, was infuriated. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. Tomski was withdrawn from the Central Council; and Lenin \nand Stalin replaced him at the Congress of Trade Unions and, after \ncajoling the Bolshevik fraction, secured a repeal of Ryazanov's \namendment. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. Dzierzynski as a supporter of internal \nparty discipline backed Lenin. 124 \nQuietly the matter was dropped, and Lenin was left to allow his ire to \nexpire. It could not be imposed without the co-\noperation of the party leadership in Moscow and the provinces. Once more the individual performance of Lenin would be \ncrucial. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. 131 Their words were like extra \nchapters to Lenin's booklet; they constituted a case for New Economic \nPolicy not merely to be accepted but also extended into other areas of \nthe economy. Vareikis, a Bolshevik \nsophisticated in the party's doctrines, challenged the Marxist validity \nof Lenin's attitude to the peasantry. He scrutinised Lenin's pamphlet \nwith acidic wit. Chubar added to Lenin's woes. Always the target was Lenin. There had been no such Congress or \nConference in the history of the Bolshevik party, not even in the Brest-\nLitovsk dispute. In short, Lenin's report had been out of touch with the real \nsituation.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement. 149 Yet \nLenin failed to add was that the Politburo had filled the breach. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 50 \nNonetheless Lenin had indisputably carried a greater load than the \nrest, and the load involved a concatenation of crises in the economy, \nadministration, politics, security and foreign policy. \nLenin had seen red. Coming from Lenin, it sounded utterly serious. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it. Essentially he wanted \nconfirmation that he had done his best and that his measures were \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \napproved. No other Bolshevik leader could have saved the foundations \nof the New Economic Policy at this Conference in quite this way. Lenin \nsat down, battered but victorious at last. Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. Bumazhny attacked Lenin. Lenin had misjudged the needs of situation: \nthe ordinary party members as wen as the Bolshevik inte11ectua1 elite \nhad to be addressed. But Lenin replied dismissively. This time Lenin reacted more diplomatically. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. But the Russian Communist Party \ncould not guess when it would happen. 163 \nFor the moment the Bolsheviks had to elaborate their measures on \nthe premise that the October Revolution stood alone. The \nConference had been gruelling, and had put Lenin on his mettle. \nBut nobody could any longer state that the reform had been slipped \ninto the Bolshevik official projections without sustained consultation \nand ratification. 164 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDIVIDED RETREAT \nThe Conference had barely finished when, supplied with suitable drafts \nfrom the Central Committee, Sovnarkom embarked on a legislative \ncampaign to extend the New Economic Policy. Nikolai Valentinov, an ex-Bolshevik who had many contacts \nwith the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, recorded having heard that \nVareikis shouted that Lenin had lopped off 'whole chapters of \nMarxism'. It was not until October \nthat Lenin recommenced his public defence of reform. Commemorat-\ning the fourth anniversary of the Bolshevik party's seizure of power, he \nwrote in Pravda: 'Would that such a global affair could be begun \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n215 \nwithout failures and without mistakes.' 171 His only other major statements came in two \nspeeches: the first to the regime's educational officials, the speech to the \nMoscow Bolshevik Party Provincial Conference in late October. Indeed cognoscenti of Lenin's agrarian analysis in 1917 \nwould have noticed how closely Preobrazhenski followed it;179 Lenin \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould not dismiss his critic out of hand. But Preobrazhenski, who until \nthen had worked harmoniously with Lenin, irritated him more than \nany other leading Bolshevik opponent at the time. Lenin castigated the 'empty' phrases and \n'boring' expressions of intent. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future.' 182 \nThis was the sort of rhetorical souffle which, if cooked by a \nProvisional Government minister in 1917 or a Bolshevik opositionist in \n1918-1920, Lenin would have relished puncturing. In \nthis he had the advantage that, at least by midsummer, no central or \nlocal Bolshevik leader seriously proposed that the Politburo should re-\nintroduce food-supplies requisitioning. It was \npredictable that not all his fellow Bolsheviks were reconciled to the \nfurther measures on trade, finance and industry. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. 183 \nIn fact all Bolshevik leaders were committed to the reinforcement of \ncentral state planning sooner or later; and Lenin was no exception \neither in 1921 or thereafter. Furthermore, he was determined that any \ndiscussion about the New Economic Policy should involve only \nBolsheviks. He could not stress too heavily that Bolshevik hegemony \nover contemporary issues of politics, economics and culture should be \nmaintained, 184 and he kept a weather eye open for those anti-\nBolsheviks seeking to take advantage of the reforms introduced by \nthe Politburo. Bolsheviks arguing among themselves were one \nthing; Bolsheviks indulging their enemies by allowing them access to \nthe printing press was entirely another. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed. Lenin promoted \nthe change and disliked Trotski's proposal on the grounds that it would \nlead to bureaucratic meddling. Scarcely had the ashes of the \n'trade union discussion' been raked into the earth than Trotski and \nLenin were lighting a touch-paper for yet another inflammation of the \nparty.", "Bolshevik_Rule_1918": " The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. In fact the Bolshevik central leadership lived in \nconditions which, if they were modest by the standards of the tsars, \nwere yet far removed from the still increasing poverty of Russian \nfactory workers. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas. The Cheka had had its \nmen present at both the Corn Exchange and the Mikhelson Factory, \nand Bolshevik party officials likeN.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nSverdlov and his colleagues were ruthlessly seizing a chance to lay \ncollective guilt at the door of a party which had been overwhelmingly \nmore popular that the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable. \nLenin pretended that things were happier in Soviet Russia than \nKautsky rightly contended. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. They knew the reality of \n'Soviet power'. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. Kautsky had posed a substantive \nquestion: why did prudence require the disenfranchisement of a \nRussian bourgeoisie which by Lenin's own acknowledgement was \nweak.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Offered as a review of Kautsky's booklet, Lenin's \nchapters in reality evaded the points made by both Kautsky and \nMartov in recent months. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement. \nNikolai II and the Imperial family had been moved around the country \nsince the February Revolution of 1917.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic.55 Sverdlov told the Central Committee on 19 May 1918 that a \ndefinitive decision was needed about 'what to do with Nikolai'. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. He led a small group of Bolshevik leaders in \nMoscow who questioned whether the Cheka should be allowed to kill \nthe people it arrested without handing them over for due investigation \nand trial. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign. The problem \nwas that Kamenev was outnumbered in the inner counsels of the \nBolshevik central party leadership. This resulted in a minor victory for the anti-Cheka \nBolsheviks: the Cheka had previously gloried in its licence to ignore \nother institutions. Bukharin as an individual \ncould not be acquainted with all abuses, and arbitrary, hasty decisions \nremained intrinsic to the Bolshevik party's policy. 86 Dzierzynski had requested that \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfraudsters in the state administration and the families of persons found \nto have gone over the Whites ought also to be subject to summary \nexecution by his officials. But the tension between Lenin and Dzierzynski, if it existed, \nwas negligible. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him.92 But \nnot even deaths in his own family deflected Lenin from his policy; and, \nconsciously or not, he even relished the violence. His instructions to the \nPenza Bolshevik leaders on II August 1918 are testimony to this: \n'Hang no fewer than a hundred well-known kulaks, rich-bags and \nblood-suckers (and be sure that the hanging takes place in full view of \nthe people). The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated.97 \nThese world-changing events made no appearance on the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee agenda-sheet through to the end of the year.98 \nThere was no decline of interest in Germany; but Lenin and his \ncolleagues could not be certain, at least until the first week of \nNovember, that the German military machine was irreparably harmed \nand incapable of turning its power against Moscow. Lenin saw the \nSpartakusbund, which was a splinter group of the old German Social-\nDemocratic Party led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnecht, as the \nlikeliest ally; and Joffe was instructed to start talks with them on 20 \nSeptember. Lenin wrote impatiently to Sverdlov on I October: 'Things \nhave so \"accelerated\" in Germany that we too must not fall behind \nthem. Lenin sensed that a German October \ncould follow the Russian October of the previous year: 'The \ninternational revolution has got nearer over the past week to such an \nextent that account has to be taken of it as an event of the days \nimmediately ahead. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. 107 Thus the Russian peasant was to give sustenance \nto both the Russian and the German worker. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. In October he had signed a \nfinancial deal with the German government for the delivery of 80,000 \ntons of coal to Russia; 109 and, in return, he ensured that the Bolsheviks \nof Ukraine did not try to attack the German troops. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. He had always \nfound it easier to make compromises with rival socialists abroad than \nwith those he encountered in the Russian empire. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. 122 \nREDS AND WHITES \nAmong the faults of the Spartakists had been their lack of organisation \nand preparation and their underestimation of the forces ranged against \nthem; and Lenin was right to highlight them. With no greater excuse he \nfailed to anticipate the abrupt transformation in the Russian Civil War \nin the last two months of 1918. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. Thus the Soviet republic of Russia was \nreduced to a territory little greater than the mediaeval principality of \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMuscovy. The Reds retreated in disorder on 13 \nDecember 1918. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. Since 1914 he \nhad rejected all attempts to make distinctions between reactionaries, \nconservatives, liberals and anti-Bolshevik socialists; his political \nuniverse was Manichean. The \nDon Cossacks were meanwhile causing difficulties for the Bolsheviks \nand their Red forces in the southern cities of the Volga; and the French \nhad landed their naval squadron in Odessa on the Black Sea on 18 \nDecember 1918. \nIt was in this awful winter for Bolshevism that, for the first and last \ntime, he contemplated territorial concessions to the Russian foes of the \nSoviet state.129 The terms approved by Lenin excluded neither the relinquish-\ning of land to the Whites nor even an acceptance of responsibility for \ndebts incurred by previous Russian governments. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. Lenin wanted no repetition of \nthe searing controversy he had had with the Left Communists. \nKolchak and Denikin might know about the Prinkipo offer; the \nBolshevik party, apart from a few Central Committee members, were \nkept in the dark. They were for 'Russia One and Indivisible', and in \nany case perceived that any settlement with Lenin would last only so \nlong as he felt too weak to attack them. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. There could be no certainty that they \nwould hold Moscow against Kolchak and Denikin, and Bolshevik \nfamilies had to be ready to flee in an emergency. Lenin would have been the prime quarry of the \nWhites if ever they broke their way through to the capital. \nFEEDING RUSSIA \nThere is a recurrent supposition that Lenin resorted to force against the \npeasantry only under the most extreme pressure of Civil War. In Lenin's opinion, the objective had to be \nthe centralisation of food supplies, the unification of the proletariat \nand the formation of organs of the village poor (and this was written \njust a few days before the decree on the kombedy). By the end of 1918 \nthere were nearly 140,000 committees of the village poor in European \nRussia; and 7370 peasant cells of the Bolshevik party had been \nestablished. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 156 Leading Bolsheviks \nwere turning to an extremely small region to victual both the Red \nArmy and the urban population of 'Sovdepiya'. Sovnarkom's minutes are not detailed on the point; \nbut it may well be that Lenin anticipated a resolution of the crisis in \nfood supplies through the stocks of the Ukrainian peasantry. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. \nFor the former Left Communists, the policy was yet another reason for \nabandoning opposition to Lenin; it seemed to them that their industrial \n(as well as commercial and agricultural) recommendations were at last \nbeing implemented. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction.", "Zurich_1913": " They had left their motherland involuntarily; and \nmost of them regarded Geneva, Berne and Zurich as the least hateful \nof alternative bases. A large Russian \ncommunity inhabited Switzerland. He accepted an invitation to Leipzig \nto give a lecture in April 1913;26 and in June he accompanied \nKrupskaya on a longer trip to Berne in Switzerland in search of \nmedical treatment for her worsening thyroid problem.", "Bolshevik_Theorists_1913": " Russian revolutionaries attracted little \nattention from the authorities. Swiss \norderliness could grate upon the sensibilities of Russians (although \nthis was never Lenin's reaction. \nThere was no joy for Lenin in deciding, in June 1912, to move to \nAustria-Hungary. Enquiries were made \nabout prices and passport regulations, and about the intensity of the \nlocal police's interest in Russian revolutionaries. 3 \nAnd yet Lenin and Krupskaya were still considering spending \nsummer 1912 in Geneva prior to any firm decision on their long-term \nresidence. It was \npossible to receive Russian newspapers within three days, and easier \nto contribute to and collaborate with the editors of the legal \nBolshevik press. 7 Krupskaya was to recall that Lenin was drawn to \nGalicia especially by his wish to influence the affairs of the factional \ndaily newspaper, Pravda, which had at last been issued in the capital \non 22 April 1912 under N. 8 An announcement \nthat a daily would be appearing had been made by the St Petersburg \nBolsheviks on 15 January (while the Prague Conference was taking \nplace);9 and the Prague delegates had supported schemes for an \nintensification of efforts in the legal press. 10 Lenin's belatedness in \nmoving from Paris could well have been a further sign of his \ndisapproval of the project. Perhaps, too, police agents were right that Lenin \nwas already looking forward to the working of the Fourth State \nDuma. \nBut Lenin may have had little choice. Lenin's letter to Gorki specified that the Central \nCommittee subsequently set up a Foreign Bureau in Galicia, 12 and \nthis could signify that he had moved under some pressure. Be that as \nit may, Lenin came to feel glad about the transfer. The opportunity \nfor mountain-walking in the Tatras; the similarities of everyday life \nto conditions in the Russian empire; the physical separation from the \natmosphere of internecine factional struggle in France and Switzer-\nland, which took its toll on Lenin despite his relish for it; and the \ngreater chances for Russia-based Bolsheviks to travel out to meet \nhim: all these factors contributed to a feeling that the Galician \nsojourn was only 'a semi-emigration'. Lenin continued to contribute; but the main work was \nentrusted to L. 14 In the year before moving \nto Galicia Lenin was contributing fewer articles to the Workers' \nNewspaper and Social-Democrat than to the Russia-based newspaper \nThe Star and the new periodical Enlightenment. 15 Nor were he and \nother emigre Bolsheviks alone in re-orientating their literary en-\ndeavours.17 The motivations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are \nuncertain; but perhaps the fact that no Bolshevik had up to then \nbeen similarly treated indicates that the Okhrana wanted to boost the \nmore moderate forces of Marxism in an attempt to check the growing \nradicalism of the workers' movement. In March 1913, \n Storms Before the Storm \n37 \nLenin opted for a house near the summer resort village of Zakopane, \nwhich lay close by the town railway station of Poronin and a hundred \nkilometres from Krakow.21 \nThe Bolsheviks were not the only anti-Romanov revolutionaries in \nthe area. Josef \nPilsudski, the future vanquisher of the Red Army in the Soviet-\nPolish war in 1920 and dominant Polish politician in the inter-war \nperiod, led a faction which controlled the party's Combat Organisa-\ntion. He had taken a group of activists into the Russian empire in \n1908 and robbed a train carrying 200,000 roubles. That their private contacts were \ncloser is probable, since Zinoviev subsequently suggested that \nPilsudski's men helped the Bolsheviks with their security precau-\ntions. In addition, Pilsudski had been sentenced to exile in \nconnection with the 1886 conspiracy of Lenin's elder brother \nAleksandr to assassinate the Russian emperor. 23 \nThus the emigre Bolshevik leadership was not the exclusive source \nof concern for the Romanovs in Galicia. Indeed, it was Pilsudski, not \nLenin, whose extradition was requested by the St Petersburg \nauthorities.Z4 It was Pilsudski's military units which exercised in \nthe streets and fields around Zakopane;25 and Lenin, always being \nalert to the practical requirements of armed revolution, cannot have \nfailed to have been impressed by Pilsudski's project to twin \nrevolutionism with nationalism. It is not too fanciful to suppose \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthat the Galician sojourn greatly reinforced Lenin's feeling that \nRussian social-democrats should take the 'national question' in the \nRomanov empire more seriously. \nLenin, however, did not confine himself to Galicia. He accepted an invitation to Leipzig \nto give a lecture in April 1913;26 and in June he accompanied \nKrupskaya on a longer trip to Berne in Switzerland in search of \nmedical treatment for her worsening thyroid problem. Visits to Galicia by Bolshevik Duma \ndeputies occurred sporadically through 1913, and on two occasions \nthese coincided with Central Committee meetings in Krakow and \nPoronin. All \noccurred in Galicia,31 and Lenin, naturally, played a prominent role. 32 Pravda and the Duma \ndeputies were the addressees most frequently contacted, but commu-\nnication was kept up also with many other Bolshevik supporters in \nthe Romanov lands. Krupskaya's address-book was being rapidly \nfilled and by mid-1914 it contained 271 names of contacts in the \nRussian empire, and included Bolsheviks for nearly every province of \nthe Romanov empire. Lenin railed at those who would not write regularly. 35 \nRevolutionaries in the Russian political underground, harassed by \na life on the run from the Okhrana, responded frostily to his \nimprecations. The Foreign \nBureau, since only Lenin and Zinoviev were based in the emigra-\ntion, sounded grander than it really was; and the joint sessions of the \nemigres and the Russian undergrounders prevented Lenin from \nclaiming to speak in the name of all Bolsheviks without consulta-\ntion. Most of the \nBolshevik Duma deputies even wanted a merger of Bolshevik Pravda \nand Menshevik Luch.42 Lenin muttered that Pravda was a 'sleepy old \nspinster'. \nAnd Lenin made the most of his advantages. Not for the last time, Lenin acted to \ncorrect Stalin's line.49 \nUnfortunately for them as well as for Lenin, both Sverdlov and \nStalin were arrested in February 1913, but their replacement as \neditor, Miron Chernomazov, was greatly to Lenin's liking. Taking \nover in May 1913, Chernomazov took exactly the polemical posture \ntraditionally demanded by Lenin; and fifty articles by Lenin \nappeared in the initial two months of his editorship. \nIn the Duma fraction, Bolsheviks such as M. At Poronin in September 1913, ten months after taking \ntheir seats in the Duma, they finally acceded to his arguments: 52 in \nOctober, Bolshevik and Menshevik deputies sat apart. But the persuasiveness of \nLenin, and indeed of Malinovski who worked alongside them, must \nalso have contributed to the Bolshevik deputies' eventual decision to \nbreak with their Menshevik counterparts. Lenin had exerted considerable authority in Central Commit-\ntee, in the Bolshevik Duma fraction and in Pravda. 55 He boasted in public about the election of Bolsheviks \nto the union boards. 57 \nLocal Bolshevik bodies experienced no general renaissance. The Bolsheviks had no answer to the police's interventions. \nTHE 'NATIONAL QUESTION' \nLenin, despite frequent invitations from Pravda, wrote next to \nnothing about the trade unions; there was to be no equivalent of \nWhat Is To be Done. His most \ncontroversial recommendation related to the future of the Russian \nempire. He went further than any Russian Social-Democratic Labour \nParty leader in taking account of the national aspirations of non-\nRussians, and demanded that 'the nations oppressed by the tsarist \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonarchy' should be granted 'the right of self-determination, i. Lenin the \ncentralist and internationalist par excellence agreed, but argued that \ntactical subtlety was required. The August 1912 gathering of non-Bolshevik factions con-\nvoked by Trotski had approved this very slogan. 64 \nLenin read Bauer's book immediately after its appearance, but \nmade no open comment on it for six years. This should not be allowed to disguise how much had been \nlearned by Lenin from Bauer, especially on the contingent nature of \nnationhood. Lenin also started to emphasise, as he had not done \nbefore reading the work of Bauer (as well as of Karl Kautsky), that \nnationalism would neither disappear for a lengthy epoch nor rule out \nthe possibility of economic and cultural advance for newly-indepen-\ndent nations.67 The Jewish Bund in the Russian Social-Democratic \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLabour Party had always Ieant in this direction and successfully \nadvocated it in Vienna in August 1912.69 Bauer did not have Jogiches's \nabsolute hostility to national independence movements in Europe; \nbut that did not stop Lenin from banding them together in his \npolemics against them. 70 \nLenin's main criticism was that the respective proposals of both \nBauer and the non-Bolshevik factions at Trotski's Vienna gathering \nin August 1912 were inherently bureaucratic, inefficient and anti-\ncentralist. The counter-scheme \nsketched in Lenin's theses of 1913 rejected extra-territorial proposals \nfor the national question and insisted that nationally-discrete \nterritories at local level were the best assurance that multinational \nstates would not break up into fragments. 71 \nThe replies of Lenin's opponents have fallen into undeserved \nneglect. Lenin had written breezily about protection of the minor-\nities; but, apart from equality of language rights, he had been \nextremely unspecific. Lenin treated Semkovski and Zhordania with \nvituperation concerning their extra-territorial ideas; but he presented \nno defence against their objections to his own theses. \nLenin in power was to appreciate the need to go beyond dealing \nwith the national question through autonomous nationally-based \nterritorial units. 74 \nAt all events Zhordania, rightly impugned Lenin in 1913 for trying \nto terminate debate before discussions had run their course.75 Lenin \nwas, in fact, more forthcoming in the other half of the dispute: in his \npolemic against Luxemburg and Jogiches. Moreover, he knew that most leading Bolshevik \ntheorists sympathised with Luxemburg's analysis. 76 Some were \nRussian neophytes like Nikolai Bukharin and Georgi Pyatakov; \nothers were non-Russians such as the Georgian Filip Makharadze \nand the Jewish Evgeniya Bosh. 77 Lenin could not afford not to \nengage them in an exchange of opinions.'80 Publicly he \nwas less intemperate; but his theses contained the notion that the \nbourgeoisies of Finland and Poland were pro-tsarist and that \nliberation would come to the Finnish and Polish proletariats only \nthrough alliance with the Russian proletariat.81 He made a similar \nargument about the Ukraine in the November-December 1913 issue \nof Enlightenment.84 Alone of leading \nBolshevik theorists, Stalin came to Lenin's assistance before the \n1914-1918 war.85 Indeed, Stalin provided easily the most compre-\nhensive Bolshevik analysis of the national question. Lenin supplied \nmainly fragmented materials, whereas Stalin leaned heavily on \nKautsky and produced definitions, bibliographical surveys and \narguments aplenty.86 And yet even Stalin, writing in Enlightenment \nfrom March 1913 onwards, was more eager to excoriate the Bund \nthan to argue the positive case for Lenin's policy. 87 \nBut it was close enough to Lenin's views for Lenin to be \nenormously grateful. But \nLenin glossed over the difficulty. 90 Secondly, Lenin firmly rejected \nfederalism in all its guises.91 And, thirdly, he proposed that the ultimate \nobjective for Marxists was not merely a rapprochement of the \nnationalities, but a 'fusion' which would permanently eradicate \nnational differences and consciousness.92 Under Stalin in the 1930s \nthis objective became, as Lenin had never intended, a pretext for a \nprogramme of 'Russification'; nor did the tendency entirely vanish \nafter Stalin's death. A fourth point, though, is much more to Lenin's \ncredit: after the October Revolution of 1917, Lenin's government \nconfirmed the independence of Poland (which was in any case under \nGerman occupation) but also gave it to Finland (which was not).93 \nSCANDALS \nLenin none the less continued to exude exceptional self-confidence.95 \nBauman's death in 1905 inspired Lenin to write a fulsome obituary \ndedicated to 'the eternal memory of a fighter in the ranks of Russian \nsocial-democracy'. 96 \nThe choice of an undesirable personage such as Bauman as not \nonly an acceptable but even a respected associate boded ill for the \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbehaviour of Bolsheviks when (as, admittedly, hardly seemed very \nlikely before the First World War) they took power in Russia. \nDoubts continued to arise about Lenin's judgement of individuals; \nand his mode of behaviour tacitly encouraged others to act in a \nsimilar manner. \nLenin did not have our retrospective vantage point and could not \nanticipate the full range of horrors breeding in the mind of Stalin. This was part and parcel of his \nsupport for the armed robberies conducted by Bolsheviks in the \nRussian empire in 1906-9 as well as his condoning of the marriage of \nBolsheviks A. 98 Practical activists and practical results \nwere Lenin's objectives: the criteria for assessing the means to these \nends were prudential, not moral for him. In 1914, furthermore, it \nbecame abundantly clear that Lenin's prudence could not be taken \nfor granted; and it was not Stalin but a more pressing evil, R. Malinovski, Central Committee \nmember and Bolshevik spokesman in the State Duma, vanished from \nSt Petersburg in mid-May.99 The intensifying rumours that he was an \nOkhrana informer were confirmed for everyone but Lenin. \nLenin had spurned them as a slur on Malinovski and an attempt \nto sow dissension among Bolsheviks loyal to him. But in 1912 the young Bolshevik theorist \nNikolai Bukharin arrived in Krakow. 100 Bukharin plainly meant \nLenin well, and Lenin was pleased to welcome a comrade who \nregarded himself as a 'pupil'; but Bukharin was convinced that the \nstories about Malinovski and his undercover role for the Okhrana \nwere accurate. He was \nbetter off than his Duma stipend permitted; he enthusiastically \nbacked Lenin's schismatic schemes among Bolsheviks even in that \nfirst year after the Prague Conference when other pro-Lenin \nBolshevik leaders, such as Stalin, were loathe to endorse them \nwithout qualification; and arrests of comrades were made which \nwere only explicable either by boundless ill-luck or by the existence of \na highly-placed police agent: nobody seriously suspected Lenin, \nZinoviev or Kamenev. But Lenin \nintransigently refused to accept the case. 103 \nEven when Malinovski absconded in 1914, Lenin refused to \nacknowledge reality. Again, in 1913, Lenin had written to Kamenev: \n'We have suffered some heavy arrests.' 105 To have recognised Malinovski for \nwhat he was would have led to a bout of self-reproach which was not \ncongenial to Lenin. Malinovski had been the \nBolshevik chiefs eyes, ears and even mouth in Russia. \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis blunder of Lenin's was not his worst error. Such \nwas Lenin's naivete that, even after Malinovski had disappeared and \nleft political activity (and therefore left the party in the lurch), he \nclaimed that Malinovski had been the victim of slander. Lenin \nbelieved what he wanted to believe. Petrovski had initially \ninformed Lenin that the 'Liquidators' were sowing the rumours, 107 \nbut Lenin sensed that Petrovski would not long stand by Malinovski. \nA telegram was sent from Krakow adjuring the Bolshevik Duma \nfraction not 'to get nervous'; its members were asked to refrain from \nexpelling Malinovski from the fraction. Lenin's reasoning was \nstrictly pragmatic: 'Everything is over with Malinovski, everything's \nfinished. \nYet Malinovski had retained credence in his ability to delude \nLenin. 111 Lenin, judging by his dismissive remarks about \nBukharin's being 'credulous about gossip' in 1916, 112 continued to \nfeel that the entire affair was a provocation concocted by as yet \nunidentified enemies of Bolshevism; he even wrote to Malinovski, \nafter he fell into German captivity in the war, in pursuit of further \ncollaboration. 113 \n Storms Before the Storm \n51 \nDEBATES ON WAR AND IMPERIALISM \nIf Lenin's choice of associates was widely thought to be faulty, his \nattitude to imperialism and militarism caused small resentment in his \nparty. Lenin \nread the literature, but did not essay a major contribution of his own. 114 \nThe Bolshevik I. Skvortsov-Stepanov produced a lengthy two-\npart essay on imperialism for the journal Enlightenment; but he \nelaborated few new ideas and, as with other Russian Marxists, drew \nhis inspiration on this issue mostly from theorists elsewhere in \nEurope. 116 \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe first to undertake a serious analysis of the causes of \nimperialism was Karl Kautsky, who summarised his arguments in \nhis book Socialism and C o/onialism, in 1907. 118 \nLenin read Kautsky's articles in Die Neue Zeit, but barely added to \nthe literature. Lenin was equally in line with Kautsky's argument \nwhen he added that Russian armaments manufacturers had an \ninterest in promoting an expansionist foreign policy. 121 A few \nsimilar statements came from Lenin before 1904,122 when Russia \nwent to war against Japan. \nEvidently Lenin was no less ambiguous about it than was Marx. In \nLenin's view, the Russo-Japanese war was a struggle 'between a \ndespotic and backward government and politically free and culturally \nfast progressing people'. 124 Lenin's judgement on the extent of \nfreedom in Japan may be challenged; but, in the tradition of Marx \nand Engels, he took sides in a given war by the criterion of the \nrespective political and economic 'progressiveness' of the two \nbelligerent states. Kautsky, for the German Social-Democratic Party, \nwrote passionately about the rise of militarism in Europe; and Lenin, \nMartov and Rosa Luxemburg wanted to shape a framework for \naction in the event of a general European \\\\ar.129 Lenin was content. Lenin \n(and here he left Luxemburg behind) emphasised that 'revolutionary \nwars' might be necessary.137 Hilferding's book was recognised to be not only a \nmassive contribution to Marxist theory but also a contemporary \neconomic classic.138 It is not known when Lenin read it; but he \nprobably knew its contents soon after publication. 139 This emphasis on economic measures with little \nreference to politics was to call forth criticism from Lenin in the \nFirst World War. He described imperialism as \n'capitalism in its latest stage of development' - a phrase picked up by \nLenin after 1914. Lenin read \nRadek's pamphlet and took notes, but again he did not reveal his \nopinion;144 nor did he comment on the possibility, mooted by \nKautsky from 1911, that the imperial nations might mitigate their \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrivalry and avoid war by reaching a concordat for the peaceful \ncollective exploitation of all colonial peoples. 145 This idea, which \nbecame known as the theory of 'ultra-imperialism', caused Lenin to \nput pen to paper only after 1914. \nHer Accumulation of Capital, which appeared in 1913, surveyed the \nevolution of capitalism and examined Hilferding's arguments. Lenin, having failed \nto be disconcerted by Hilferding and Radek, was annoyed with \nLuxemburg. 148 The second irritation for him was that \nLuxemburg referred to the Russian socialist debates of the 1890s, \ncontending that 'V. Ilin' (which was Lenin's main legal pseudonym) \nhad been wrong to criticise populists such as V. 149 \nLenin was enraged, standing by his old positions and taking \noffence at her few complimentary remarks about his Development \nof Capitalism. 155 \nTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU \nEurope's leading Marxist writers were familiar with the theories of \nLenin. But the level of acquaintance was low outside that group; only \na few eccentrics with a highly-developed interest in Marxian theory \nor with an idiosyncrasy for staying in touch with the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party's affairs could have filled an area bigger \nthan a postage stamp with their knowledge about Bolshevism. Lenin \nand Krupskaya rented a succession of apartments in central and \neastern Europe in streets where the neighbours had no idea of \nBolshevik politics and, as likely as not, would not have cared to \nacquire one either. \nNonetheless there was one political forum on the Continent where \nLenin was not only famous but also a major and obtrusive figure: the \nInternational Socialist Bureau. This was \nnot the First Socialist International of Karl Marx and Mikhail \nBakunin, but the Second, which had existed since 1889. Lenin attended Bureau sessions in \nthe autumns of 1908 and 1909. This tranquillity started to come to an end with the \nJanuary 1910 Central Committee plenum, which reunited the \nfactional leaderships of Russian social-democracy and turned over \nthe disputed funds from the legacy of N. All \nthree were prominent figures in the Socialist International, and their \ndeliberations about Russian social-democratic finances dragged the \nISB into the morass of Bolshevik-Menshevik disputes. 159 \nNot approving of the outbreak of peace with the Mensheviks at the \nJanuary 1910 plenum, Lenin felt uneasy about what the arbitrators \nmight do with the money. By November 1910 he was claiming that it \nrightfully belonged only to the Bolsheviks. 162 \nLenin refused to relent, visiting Berlin in March 1911 with N. \nPoletaev, the Bolshevik editor of The Star, to negotiate with Kautsky \nand his two colleagues. Neither \nZetkin nor the other two arbitrators could forget that Lenin wished \nto split the Bolsheviks from the Mensheviks, and that a definitive \nrelease of the money to two separate factions would hasten such a \ndivision. 165 Arbitrators Kautsky and Franz Mehring had already had \nenough of the entanglement in Russian socialism. She was unwilling to act unaccompanied \nas an arbitrator and, as Lenin could see, was not averse to supposing \nthat the Bolsheviks had better legal title to the money than the \nMensheviks; 168 but still she declined to take a decision. In \nannoyance, Lenin carried out his threat to turn to the lawyers. 171 Bolsheviks G. The bemused Ducos de la Haille predictably got nowhere in \nthe time appointed - not that this was condoned by Lenin, who wrote \nto complain in September 1912. 172 Lenin sought another lawyer. The \nsnag was that Lenin had entrusted all the original documents to \nDucos's safekeeping, and he perceived that Ducos might refuse to \ngive them up without receiving some compensation for his work. In \nMarch 1913, admitting to his own 'hyper-suspiciousness', Lenin \nrequested Kamenev not to pay out any cheque until he had received \nthe necessary documents. 174 In December 1913, Lenin's trepidations were \nrealised: the Socialist International started to take an interest in the \nBolshevik-Menshevik dispute. Declaring that the Russian Social-Democratic \nLabour Party had ceased to exist, he felt justified in calling for a \nmeeting of 'all factions of the Russian labour movement' in the \nRomanov empire which accepted the social-democratic party pro-\ngramme.175 Lenin foresaw that this \n 60 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould lead not only to a financial settlement quite unsatisfactory to \nhim but also to moves towards the party's organisational reunifica-\ntion. 176 Now it was Lenin's turn to \ntemporise. The ISB's invitation to Bolsheviks and Mensheviks to \nexchange opinions could not be resisted unless he was willing to \nappear to be the party splitter he really was; and, in any case, \nsocialist lawyers such as Zraggen (who was now regarded as 'very \nweak and cowardly' by Lenin) 177 did not wish to obstruct the ISB's \nplan. \nLenin's ploy was to accept the invitation to 'a mutual exchange of \nopinions' of the Russian factions while expressing objection to \nKautsky's characterisation of the Russian Social-Democratic La-\nbour Party. He beavered away at the statistics of the votes for \nBolsheviks and Mensheviks at the 1912 State Duma elections and \nat the respective print-run of Bolshevik and Menshevik newspapers. \nHis motivations were only barely disguised: Lenin wanted to seize \nand retain the mantle of legitimacy for the Bolshevik-controlled \n'party' he had inaugurated at the Party Conference in Prague in 1912; \nand he had no intention of going to the ISB's proposed 'exchange of \nopinions' meeting in order to give up his grasp on a Bolshevik-\ndominated Central Committee. But this would require a barrage of \npreparatory propaganda to convince the ISB that the Bolsheviks \nwere indeed the sole representatives of organised Marxism in the \nRussian empire and that the Mensheviks comprised only a gaggle of \nunattached emigres and anti-party, Russia-based 'Liquidators'. Lenin had not \nattended the ISB meeting in December 1913, and he made clear that \nhe would absent himself from international gatherings in the months \nto come. 183 \nRUSSIA IN 1914 \nAnd so, in the first half of 1914, Lenin faced organisational problems \nboth international and Russian. 184 This was another device \nto arrogate legitimacy for the Bolsheviks as the principal constituent \nmembers of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Krakow delegates \nwould be able to travel on to Vienna to lobby for the Bolshevik \ncause. 186 \nThis was characteristic bluff and skulduggery from Lenin. 187 Lenin had either learned from Prague or \nbowed to advice from colleagues: a genuine invitation would be \nissued in a timely fashion to the Poles, Latvians and Lithuanians so \nas to avoid the criticisms of his neglect of the non-Russian segments \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nof the party in 1912. 188 \nLenin knew full well that his Congress's self-proclamation as the \nparty's supreme assembly would be challenged by all non-Bolsheviks. 189 He highlighted the activity of the \nBolshevik deputies to the Fourth State Duma, and emphasised that \nthe Bolsheviks had swept the board in the workers' constituencies in \nSt Petersburg and Moscow, whereas the Mensheviks had scored \nvictories in more peripheral areas and often through electoral pacts \nwith liberals. Much was also made about the election of Bolshevik \nactivists to trade union boards. His claim, which may have been \nsomewhat exaggerated, was that at least sixteen out of the capital's \ntwenty boards had moved towards the Bolsheviks.190 In the absence \nof a freely-conducted survey of popular opinion, Lenin fell back on \narithmetical extrapolations.191 This was trumpery even by Lenin's standards. Someone who had been born in the \nVolga town of Simbirsk and had, in his Development of Capitalism in \nRussia, castigated others for their sloppy statistics must have been \naware of the mathematical sleight of hand here. \nWorking-class unrest, however, certainly increased in 1914. These were \nBolshevik slogans, 193 but it is a moot point whether acquaintance \nwith Bolshevism went beyond this or indeed whether most workers \non demonstrations acquired their ideas directly from Bolsheviks. \nPravda editorials; speeches by the Bolshevik Duma deputies; public \nstatements of Bolshevik trade unionists: all these had to be cautiously \nformulated so as not to attract punitive actions by police and censor. \nUnconstrained discussion of Bolshevik ideas occurred only in the \nRussian political underground, in Siberian exile and in the emigra-\ntion. Lenin and Krupskaya had no illusions about the weakness and \nlow morale in the illegal party apparatus. In February 1914, \nKrupskaya wrote bluntly: 'The illegal organisation is pulverised. The Moscow \ncomrades talked of 'a complete break-up' of party groups. 196 Lenin \nput the problem in a nutshell (but did so in a private letter, \npresumably to avoid further demoralisation among his followers in \nRussia): 'The revolutionary mood arising in recent times in Russia \nhas the tendency to keep growing but, being insufficiently guided in \nthe absence of well-established underground organisations, can \nbecome powerless and aimless.' 197 The Bolshevik leader was not \nthe only politician to wring his hands. As always, the huge size of many \nfactories and accompanying feelings of 'alienation' among workers \ncreated difficulties; and the appalling environment, with its under-\nprovision of housing and poor sewage and recreational facilities, \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nincreased the probability of political crisis. \nLenin recognised this; and, when he was not busy explaining to the \nInternational Socialist Bureau that the Bolsheviks were in better \nshape and had greater support than the Mensheviks, urged his \ncomrades to do their utmost to re-establish the illegal party \napparatus. Krupskaya's notebook continued to acquire names/01 \nbut it was of limited practical use since the police were so skilful in \ncapturing revolutionaries. In three out of the first six months of 1914, apparently, Lenin \ndid not even write to the Bolshevik Duma deputies; and these \ndeputies, overburdened with Duma activities and other speaking \nand writing engagements, seldom visited him. 202 There was also the usual pressure on Lenin to \ncool his polemical ardour. 203 Dissatisfaction with Lenin was also expressed in \nhis discharge of technical duties.'205 \nBy 1914 Lenin, too, had come to see that his protege Chernoma-\nzov's zest for polemics was causing more harm than good; and that \nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs was being provided with regular \nexcuses to shut down Pravda. Lenin acceded to Chernomazov's \nremoval and was able, because of the shortage of competent \njournalistic talent in the capital, to secure agreement for his \nassociate Kamenev (who no longer had Workers' Newspaper to edit \nin Paris) to take over Pravda's direction in February 1914. 207 \nNor was the Central Committee as troublesome to Lenin as it once \nhad been. The Bolshevik underground members who had been \nelected at Prague and had objected to his methods - Ordzhoni-\nkidze, Goloshchekin, Spandaryan - had been arrested; and the sole \nCentral Committee member from the Party Mensheviks, D. None of them, with the exception of \nStalin, 209 stood up to Lenin as Ordzhonikidze and his friends had \ndone. At any rate Lenin was accorded much scope for initiative, at \nleast in regard to the politics of the emigration. The International \nSocialist Bureau's December 1913 decision to invite all factions of the \nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party to an 'exchange of views' \nmeeting in Brussels lay on the table.210 For some months, Lenin was \nunruffled.212 Things became stickier for Lenin when the Malinovski \nscandal erupted and, as might easily have been predicted, non-\nLeninists in the party were raising a hue and cry about Lenin's \nconvoking his own Party Congress. Lenin felt he was not the faction's ideal spokes-\nman: he would lose his temper and his opponents would have a \nchance to interrogate him.217 \nLenin worked to extricate himself from the mess. He went on \ncollating information on the respective strengths of the Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks in the legal labour movement in Russia. Nikiforova took part \nas leading Bolshevik activists in Russia.220 Lenin's subsequent letter to Bolshevik Duma deputy, \nF. Summer 1914 \nwitnessed renewed labour unrest in the Romanov empire: a general \nstrike was organised by workers in Baku in June; and, from 4 July, \nstrikes and demonstrations began in St Petersburg. 222 It is impressive that \nthe Bolshevik supreme leadership, which had insisted that the \nMensheviks underrated the revolutionary potential of the working \nclass, sat around on Lenin's veranda in Poronin oblivious of the \ndisorder in St Petersburg.", "Switzerland_1913": " The main \nreason was that Switzerland's constitution provided an unusual \ndegree of civic tolerance. A large Russian \ncommunity inhabited Switzerland.", "International_Socialist_Bureau_1913": " As a socialist internationalist, he \naimed to keep workers together in mass organisations regardless of \nnational origin.86 And yet even Stalin, writing in Enlightenment \nfrom March 1913 onwards, was more eager to excoriate the Bund \nthan to argue the positive case for Lenin's policy. 114 \nThe Bolshevik I. 125 Yet he largely overlooked such subjects, until \nin 1907 he attended the Stuttgart Congress of the Second Socialist \nInternational. He drafted a plan for an article in March \n1913. 155 \nTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU \nEurope's leading Marxist writers were familiar with the theories of \nLenin. \nNonetheless there was one political forum on the Continent where \nLenin was not only famous but also a major and obtrusive figure: the \nInternational Socialist Bureau. \nThe International Socialist Bureau was drawn from the various \nnational parties belonging to the Socialist International. This was \nnot the First Socialist International of Karl Marx and Mikhail \nBakunin, but the Second, which had existed since 1889. Lenin attended Bureau sessions in \nthe autumns of 1908 and 1909.

Herve also seemed to adhere to pacifist ideas.", "Revolutionary_Situation_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Probably there would eventually have been a \nrevolution. In mid-1914, before the war, there was no economic \ncrisis. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. But in the fateful summer of 1914 few actors \nin the international drama, whether ministers or diplomats, had a \nsense of the cataclysm awaiting their nations. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. The speed of \nthe transformation of a regional diplomatic crisis into continental \nwar was staggering; and mobilisation of whole societies and \neconomies, and not merely the combatant armies, in pursuit of \nvictory was unprecedented in wars among great powers. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. \nApparently he had written an 800-word draft of 'Tasks of \nRevolutionary Social-Democracy in the European War', before \nreaching Switzerland, in the last days of August 1914. Socialism and the revolution, \nhe declared, had been betrayed. The \nwar was not a struggle between the just and the unjust; on both sides \nit was 'a bourgeois, imperialist, dynastic' conflict. Socialists ought to respond \nby preparing for a 'revolutionary war'. Here was \nan emigre revolutionary, lacking finances, organisation and person-\nnel, declaring to his colleagues that propaganda should be directed at \ntelling the largely patriotic population in Russia to welcome the \ncountry's conquest.45 His prediction \nthat defeats would induce revolutionary crisis had been correct. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. The first wartime issue of Social-Democrat, no. \nInstead he insisted that defeat for any nation was likely to engender \nrevolution. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. In 1914 his meaning \nbecame clearer as he proposed a new slogan: European civil war. Collapse \nof the Second International stated the formal case that the parties of \nthe Second International at Stuttgart in 1907 and at Baste in 1912 \nhad undertaken to oppose their countries' entry into a continental \nwar, and to use any such military conflict for 'the acceleration of the \nfall of capitalism'. He indicated that the Basle Manifesto had been composed \nwith precisely the kind of war which broke out in 1914 in mind. It was 'imperialist'; it was \na fight to the death between two armed coalitions of powers bent \nupon global domination. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. Supposedly, revolution in Europe \nhad been possible. There had been a 'crisis' in governing circles; there \nhad been a sharp worsening of material conditions; there had been a \n'raising of the activism of the masses'. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. But the \nunrest faded rapidly after the emperor declared war on Germany and \nAustria-Hungary. Still less was a revolutionary situation discernible \nin other countries.80 The labour movement across Europe \nhad been active before 1914 in strikes and protests; but calls and \nsupport for revolutionary action were remarkable for their scarcity. But lower \nwages and poorer conditions do not demonstrate the existence of a \nrevolutionary situation. There was \ntherefore a firm social base for the development of the party's \n'opportunism' in 1914. It had \nbecome a 'political detachment of the bourgeoisie'. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. And, after the initial rallying around the \ngovernment after the declaration of war, industrial conflict returned. Industrial conflict \noccurred frequently in the last months of 1915. The war was \ndefined as imperialistic; all socialists were called upon to oppose their \ngovernments; multilateral defeatism was accepted as policy; and the \nidea that a democratic peace was achievable without revolution \nacross Europe was rejected. If national \neconomies were becoming inextricably enmeshed with each other, \nthen revolution in any single country would have immediate and \nprofound repercussions elsewhere. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. Here was a \nframe of mind which sustained a lonely politician, far from home and \ndistant from power; and which, in 1917, left him uninhibited in \npromoting his party's seizure of the reins of government.", "Bolshevik_Affairs_1914": " 3 Ad Extirpanda: \n1914-1915 \nTHE JULY CRISIS \nThe First World War, breaking out in summer 1914, sealed the fate \nof old Russia. Thus the major catalysts \nfor the Bolshevik party to advance to power, as it did in 1917, were \nweak. No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government. It is worth \nrecalling that in 1914 they did not intend to initiate a socialist \nrevolution, and that Lenin declared that the next stage in the \ncountry's development would be bourgeois. Perhaps he would have \nchanged his mind; the ease with which he did so in 1917 indicates his \nchangeability, and the Bolshevik strategy of 1905 for a bourgeois \nrevolution had always carried strong traces of a zeal for socialist \nreforms. Russia had no revolution, bourgeois or \nsocialist, in 1914; but she entered a war in central Europe which \nacquired a near-global character in the following three years. Millions of people perished in \n67 \n 68 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncombat or behind the lines; and the epidemic of Spanish influenza, \nwhich killed further millions after 1918, was all the more deadly in \nconsequence of the material and social hardships induced by the \nfighting. Zinoviev was to recall that Lenin had no idea \nthat the European war really was fast approaching. Lenin in his articles in July 1914 \nanticipated a verbal international conflict among socialists, not a \nmilitary international conflict between two great coalitions of \nEuropean states; he was describing Lilliput and not Brobdingnag. Germany \ndeclared war on Russia. The Allies, including Russia, confronted the Central Powers. \nRussia's relations with Austria-Hungary had deteriorated over the \nprevious decade; and Germany's pretensions in both Eastern Europe \nand the Near East had intermittently heightened tension between St \nPetersburg and Berlin. \nBut the economic competition to be expected from Germany in \ntraditional Russian trading areas such as Persia remained a source of \nworry. Russian business in several key industrial sectors was also \nsuffering at the hands of German firms in the Russian domestic \nmarket. In addition, Russian foreign policy from the 1890s moved \ncloser towards the embrace of the French. Russian fears about Germany were complemented by \nGerman fears about Russia. \nBy 1914, the Russian emperor judged that his country's prestige \nand geopolitical interest in the Balkans were at stake. \nA mystery endures about Lenin's attitude in the pre-war years. And yet he was little \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbothered by the vicissitudes of European diplomacy or even regional \nwars in Europe. Obsessive as he was about controlling Bolshevik affairs, he \nseldom let them expunge everything else from his mind. Galicia, where Lenin was living, \nwas overrun in autumn 1914. \n Ad Extirpanda \n71 \nARREST AND RELEASE \nLenin and Zinoviev unknowingly had chosen to live in what was to \nbe the path of the Russian advance. The additional danger for the \ntwo Bolshevik leaders was that, as Russian subjects, they and their \nwives might come under suspicion in Austrian-ruled Poland as being \nspies. Anti-Russian sentiment was \nrife among local Poles. All Russian emigrants could expect to be \ncontacted by the police authorities in Krakow sooner or later and \nLenin was an obvious object of mistrust. Lenin, Krupskaya \nand the Zinovievs none the less refused to panic. Lenin rightly stated that this implicitly \nbreached the assumptions of the Second International's anti-war \npolicy. But \nsuch behaviour was not the outright opposition that Lenin deman-\nded. From today I shall cease being a social-\n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemocrat and shall become a communist. '9 There would have been \nructions in the International even if war had not broken out; and \nLenin might have been willing to disaffiliate his Bolsheviks from \nmembership. Lenin renamed \nsocial-democrats 'social-chauvinists', seeking to emphasise their \nrupture with ideals of internationalism and anti-militarism. 11 \nIt was among the socialists of the Romanov empire that hostility \nto the war was strongest and most pervasive. The antagonism to the \nmonarchy was profound in Russia, and the chasm between socialists \nand the rest of political society was vast. In most other countries \nthere were moves by socialists towards an attenuation of social strife \nuntil the war ended. Lenin's instinctive refusal to condone the Russian imperial \ngovernment's engagement in war was paralleled by the reactions of \nmany others. \nMost Bolshevik leaders, including those hostile to Lenin, fulmi-\nnated against the dynasty and its military objectives; only a few, such \nas G. Martov, Dan, and Pavel Akselrod were as \nantagonistic as Lenin to the waging of the war. \nThe Socialist Revolutionaries, too, were riven by disputes; but Viktor \nChernov and most leaders opposed support for the Russian war \neffort.16 \nAnd yet the anti-war Russian revolutionaries were initially out of \nstep with popular sentiment in the Russian empire. Leading \nsocialist opponents of the war, if they were in the emigration, chose \nSwitzerland, Sweden or the United States of America as their haven \nfor the duration of hostilities, but few emigres faced quite the \ndilemmas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin and his colleagues, caught as they \nwere on the territory of Russia's military foe. \nOn 7 August 1914 Lenin received his first visit from the \nauthorities. Lenin contacted his Polish \nfriends. Marek, a social-democratic \nparliamentarian in Austria-Hungary, to seek his intercession on \nLenin's behalf. 22 Adler and \nDiamand responded helpfully, declaring to the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs in Vienna that the suspected Russian spy Lenin was well-\nknown throughout Europe for his dedication to the 'struggle against \nRussian tsarism'. The journey required official permission in war-\ntime, and while waiting, Lenin studied the German socialist press \nwith increasing exasperation. This was ironical; within a few \nyears Greulich would be regarded by Lenin as a deadly betrayer of \nsocialism. They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 33 But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. 37 They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. He wrote out his ideas and then had them \ntyped and circulated as carbon copies to fellow Bolsheviks in \nSwitzerland.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. 40 Its origins, \naccording to Lenin, lay in the international struggle for markets; it \nwas also an attempt to divide the international working-class \nmovement and to prevent revolution.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either.44 \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov.46 And yet Lenin remained willing to \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland.48 The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. A meeting of the Duma deputies and other \nBolshevik leaders, including Kamenev, was held at Ozerki outside \nSt Peterburg. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. 79 \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. Undoubtedly there was political \ntrouble for the Russian imperial authorities, especially in St \nPetersburg, in the month before the declaration of war. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final.92 \nReproducing the outline of Zinoviev's detailed sketch, Lenin \nsuggested that such socioeconomic factors explained the party's \nabandonment of revolutionary commitments and the implicit adop-\ntion of a strategy of peaceful and piecemeal reforms. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. He wanted 'A Marxist International \nwithout and against the opportunists' . \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. Industrial conflict \noccurred frequently in the last months of 1915. But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins. Communication with Russia ceased for weeks.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. The Baugy Bolsheviks added an inflection \nto Luxemburg's argument which would have annoyed her. 104 \nBukharin came perilously close to repudiating the old Russian \nMarxist premise that Russia's next revolution would be a 'bour-\ngeois' one. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. After the Bern conference of Bolshevik emigres, Bukharin \nmoved to Scandinavia. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. In spring 1915, \nGrimm announced the convoking of an anti-war socialist gather-\ning. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1908-\n9, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. 115 The biography was completed by \nNovember; but Lenin had by then started to fill many new note-\nbooks on philosophy. Both Plekhanov and Martov re-engaged their minds \nwith philosophical issues after 1914. 117 The fact that Lenin over-\nlooked the wartime writings of his adversaries indicates how deeply \nsubmerged he had become in his own theoretical quest. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. Those \naccounts postulating a complete revolution in his philosophy after \n1914 are misleading. Lenin's publication of a second \nedition of Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1920 was not \nfortuitous. Lenin's jottings reaffirmed the independent \nexistence of the external world. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him. Lenin's \nphilosophical cerebrations did not precede and predetermine his \npolitics.' 143 This is reminiscent of Lenin's invocation in \nWhat Is To Be Done.

No doubt the Bolsheviks would have exerted much influence in \nthe course of any conceivable revolution even in a Russia which was \nat peace and was economically buoyant; but they surely would not \nhave become the monopolistic party of government.

They also had to abandon \nthe largest part of the Bolshevik faction's archive of books, \npamphlets, manuscripts and letters. 32 \nLater, when the Bolsheviks had consolidated their power in \nRussia, a search was made in Nowy Targ for them. 33 But the temporary loss, \nwhile hardly being insignificant for a politician and a bibliophile, was \ncompensated in Lenin's mind by the knowledge that he could resume \nhis struggle against the Romanov dynasty without let or hindrance. 34 \nANNOUNCING A POLICY \nSettling again in Switzerland, Lenin was a leader with an even \nsmaller following than in the pre-war period. Contact \nwith Russia had disappeared and the central emigre apparatus had \nceased to exist; and the Central Committee was a fiction; Lenin and \nZinoviev were its only members at liberty; and the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation was a shambles. The situation with the press \nwas disastrous: Pravda had been closed down by the authorities \nshortly before the declaration of war, and the Bolsheviks themselves \nhad discontinued the foreign-based Workers' Newspaper in 1912 and \nSocial-Democrat in 1913. Lenin and Zinoviev, \nwhile still rejecting the case against Malinovski (and even proceeding \nto correspond with him when, as a Russian soldier, he was captured \nand placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp), could not take risks \nwith the lives of Bolsheviks in Russia. 36 \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's early need was to rally support in the Swiss emigration, \nbeginning with the Geneva 'section' of the Bolshevik Foreign \nOrganisation. 37 They had contacts with \nBolsheviks elsewhere in Switzerland, and the news spread that the \ntwo most eminent Bolsheviks had arrived safely. Lenin fell back on \nhis experience in the underground movement in Samara and St \nPetersburg in the 1890s. Lenin's readers amounted \nto a few hundred at most, and the overwhelming majority of those \nwere emigres.39 But the contents had an historic significance; they \nwere pillars in the formation of Lenin's Bolshevism and of the official \nideology of the early Soviet state. Lenin began and ended by cursing \nthe German Social-Democratic Party. But Lenin maintained that neither the \nCentral Powers nor the Allies should be analysed so generously.41 \nAmong anti-war Bolsheviks such words caused little dissension.42 What caused controversy was Lenin's attitude to \nRussia. He summed up his position: 'From the viewpoint of the \nworking class and the toiling masses of all the peoples of Russia, the \nlesser evil would be the defeat of the tsarist monarchy. Here was \nan emigre revolutionary, lacking finances, organisation and person-\nnel, declaring to his colleagues that propaganda should be directed at \ntelling the largely patriotic population in Russia to welcome the \ncountry's conquest. No Menshevik or Socialist Revolutionary, \nhowever opposed to the Russian government and to the war, took \nthis line; and few Bolsheviks did either.44 \nLike many socialists of the Russian empire, Lenin had advocated \n'defeatism' in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. He \nrepeated it in 1914, but there was a significant difference in the \ncircumstances: nobody in 1904 expected the Japanese, if victorious, \nto occupy Russia. German war aims in 1914 were not definitively \nformulated; but political commentators in Russia, from govern-\nmental spokesmen through to Marxist theorists, anticipated that \nthe German armed forces would dismember the Russian empire and \nreduce the Russian state to a semi-colonial dependency of Germany. Russia's dire \npotential plight after a German victory was eloquently sketched by \nLenin's adversary Petr Maslov.46 And yet Lenin remained willing to \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncall for Russia's defeat even though he repeatedly asserted, with the \nmechanical reliability of a gramophone, that all belligerent states \nwere bent upon territorial expansion and political and economic \ndominion. No wonder Lenin's differential attitude to the Russian \nand German war effort policy was regarded as illogical by Bolshevik \nactivists who read his writings or listened to him in Switzerland.48 The presence of Bolshevik Duma deputy F. \nSamoilov, who had been convalescing abroad and was set to return \nto Russia shortly after the gathering, must also have been a factor; \nthe Bern Bolsheviks would not have wished to compromise \nthemselves and Samoilov in the eyes of the Swiss authorities by \nholding a session of overtly political character.49 \nNo definitive decision on policy, of course, could be taken by the \nBolsheviks of Bern alone; but Samoilov's attendance gave Lenin a \nchance to relay his policies back to Russia. In fact, the other five \nBolshevik Duma deputies, quite without Lenin's intervention, had \nbehaved with commendable adherence to the spirit of Stuttgart and \nBasle by demonstratively walking out of the State Duma session \nwhich voted war credits to the Russian government on 26 July \n1914.50 Menshevik deputies also had opposed the Russian declara-\ntion of war and left the chamber. A joint criticism by Menshevik and \nBolshevik deputies was read out by the Menshevik, V. \nLike the revolutionary emigres, however, the Bolsheviks in Russia \nhad to elaborate policy for the duration of the war. Samoilov's return \nto St Petersburg with Lenin's recommendations inevitably caused \ncontroversy. It was decided that a survey of Bolshevik opinion \nthrough the enipire was needed. Leading Bolsheviks in the capital \nwere known to take an anti-war line. But Lenin's defeatist demands \nwere contentious. A meeting of the Duma deputies and other \nBolshevik leaders, including Kamenev, was held at Ozerki outside \nSt Peterburg. \n Ad Extirpanda \n79 \nBolshevik Duma deputies such as G. \nMuranov refused to break ranks; and Lenin's regret at their exile \nto Siberia was alleviated at least somewhat by the evidence that \nBolsheviks in Russia were ready to take a stand on their anti-war \nprinciples. 51 \nIn October 1914, Lenin travelled to Geneva and Zurich to talk \nwith other Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik central emigre apparatus \nhad rapidly begun to re-emerge. \nDebate with fellow Bolsheviks in Switzerland induced changes in \nLenin's stance on the war. Karpinski asked why, if social-democrats \nwere 'internationalists' who hated the governments of all belligerent \ncountries, did Lenin prefer a German victory over Russia. Karpinski \nalso queried Lenin's rhetoric. Did Lenin really contend \nthat all Russian soldiers, conscripted from the peasantry and the \nworking class, were like the reactionary antisemitic thugs of the pre-\nwar Black Hundreds.54 Lenin excised the slur from his statements. \nMore importantly, he ceased to advocate 'defeatism' exclusively for \nRussia. He still suggested in Social-Democrat that the Russian regime \nwas the worst of Europe's regimes and that Russia's defeat was more \ndesirable than that of any other nation. Lenin brushed the question aside. 57 \nLenin added that the politics of each belligerent state had become \ninextricably linked to the politics of all the others. Socialism could \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nnot be expected 'to complete its victory within the framework of a \nfatherland'. Before 1914, Lenin had said that the \noutbreak of conflict among the European powers should be \ncountered by socialists who would launch a revolutionary war. For Plekhanov, Lenin had become an insane sloganeer \ninstead of a serious politician. But if Plekhanov would not argue with \nLenin, Lenin relished the chance to debate with Plekhanov, who \ntravelled from France on 10 October 1914 to address a Russian \nemigre gathering in Lausanne. At its end, Lenin stood \nup to denounce what he regarded as mere chauvinism and to claim \nthat Plekhanov had parted company forever with Marxism.61 His aggressiveness was not \nconfined to Russians. He no longer had the slightest respect for \nany leading Marxist in Europe. Kautsky's refusal to \ncondemn Kaiser Wilhelm, according to Lenin, was as heinous as \nPlekhanov's argument in favour of Russian national self-defence. For the first time, apart from small \ngatherings of Bolsheviks, Lenin had publicly castigated Karl \nKautsky. \nIt was Lenin's extremism that resulted in his Bolshevik friends \nremaining isolated from other Russian Marxists in emigration who \nequally abhorred Plekhanov's 'defencism'. Lenin declared his opinion frankly: 'It \nwould not be a bad thing if the Germans took Riga, Tiflis and \nHelsingfors. Lenin did not initially oppose a \nrapprochement.' Praise indeed, by Lenin's stand-\nards. Lenin also dubbed Golos ('The Voice') as the best in \nEurope.67 Lenin's \nalmost puerile stridency about 'European civil war' had no echo in \ntheir statements. The Menshevik Duma deputies, unlike their Bolshevik \ncounterparts, were not arrested; and it irritated Lenin that Chkheidze \nretained opportunities for legal propaganda. His heart hardened fast \nagainst compromise with non-Bolsheviks in the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party. 70 \nThe Bolsheviks would go it alone among Russian social-demo-\ncrats.71 Lenin also aimed to \nhave tight control over the Committee of the Foreign Organisation. \nIts fund-raising and co-ordinating functions would be useful: and \npresumably Lenin did not want it to emerge as a rival Bolshevik \nbody. He therefore planned \nto call a conference of all Bolshevik foreign sections in Bern in \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFebruary 1915 and secure the re-election of the Committee of the \nForeign Organisation. 72 \n'THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL' \nLenin was signalling, for the first time in his career, that the \nestablishment of socialism in Europe's advanced industrial countries \nhad become an immediate possibility and objective.75 This commitment, according to Lenin, had been \ninfringed. 77 \nIn Lenin's presentation, the Basle Manifesto had predicted that \nthe outbreak of a European war would be accompanied by a \nrevolutionary situation; and he argued that this had been confirmed \n Ad Extirpanda \n83 \nby events in July-August 1914. 79 \nConsequently, Lenin could not nail down his specific charges. \nA second defect lies in Lenin's contention that a European \nrevolutionary situation existed. Undoubtedly there was political \ntrouble for the Russian imperial authorities, especially in St \nPetersburg, in the month before the declaration of war. \nLenin also asserted that there had been a drastic deterioration of \nwages and conditions before 1914; but several groups within the \nworking class were better off than ever before. In fairness to Lenin, it \nmust be acknowledged that other groups were worse off and that \nstandards of living differed from country to country. Lenin's assertions were based on inadequate \nsociology and shaky argumentation. \nOnly the party leaders, according to Lenin, were in a position to act \nwith sufficient knowledge and decisiveness in the swiftly-changing \nconditions of pre-war crisis.82 Other Russian Marxists, however, believed that \nLenin and Zinoviev idealised German working-class attitudes.85 \nOther leaders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, such \nas Trotski and Bukharin, were less scathing about the German \nworkers and maintained faith in the imminence of a German \nsocialist revolution. Lenin referred to the problem only glancingly; the \ngreater problem, in his view, was constituted by the sins of the party \nleadership.87 \nConsequently Lenin's demand for the abandonment of the Second \nInternational and the establishment of a Third had few supporters \noutside Bolshevik circles. 88 Plekhanov was nearer to Lenin in washing his hands of the \n Ad Extirpanda \n85 \nSecond International; but Lenin could not found a Third Interna-\ntional with a Plekhanov, who stoutly defended the necessity for \nGermany to be defeated. \nAnd so Lenin was compelled to explain why the break with the \nGerman Social-Democratic Party had to be final. It was actually, in \nLenin's abusive caricature, a congeries of 'social-chauvinists'.93 \nWhere Zinoviev and Lenin marched intellectually, not only \nMichels but also European social-democratic leftists such as Rosa \nLuxemburg and Anton Pannekoek had gone before. At last \n 86 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin had shed the complacent optimism about the German Social-\nDemocratic Party so evident in What Is To Be Done. But to expect anything else of \nLenin is to misunderstand his mood and aims in 1914. \nSTRUGGLES AMONG BOLSHEVIKS: 1915 \nLenin, getting his second wind after the shocks of mid-1914, was \npleased. The first full year of war was nearly catastrophic for Nikolai \nII's government. The Russian armies advancing into East Prussia \nwere rebuffed. The war-industry \ncommittees were shunned by the Bolsheviks; it was mainly the right-\nwing exponents of Menshevism, under Kuzma Gvozdev who joined, \nand these were committed to national defence. But the Okhrana \ncoped adequately, strike leaders were arrested and Bolshevik party \ngroups were hunted down with notable zeal. \nNone the less Lenin and his associates felt that the chances of \nrevolution in Russia had increased. In mid-\nOctober 1914 Lenin had initiated a scheme whereby Aleksandr \nShlyapnikov, a Petersburg Bolshevik leader, would move to Stock-\nholm to operate as courier between Switzerland and Russia. Towards \nthe end of the year, Shlyapnikov had written to Lenin revealing that \nsupport for his attitude to the war was growing among Bolsheviks in \nRussia. He made arrangements for the regular dispatch of Social-\nDemocrat to Petrograd (as St Petersburg was renamed, to avoid its \nGermanic linguistic connotations). Yet Lenin's \nhopes about Shlyapnikov were soon dashed. Shlyapnikov and his \ncolleague and lover, Aleksandra Kollontai, also asked Lenin to move \nto Scandinavia to facilitate better contact with St Petersburg. They \nthemselves went to Oslo and left the Bolshevik transport arrange-\nments in ruins.98 At \n 88 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch a distance it was hard for Lenin to dissuade them from being so \nunco-operative (and he was subsequently, when it was too late, to \nrecognise the cogency of their request). The conference \nof all the emigre Bolshevik sections, scheduled for the beginning of \n1915, was delayed by the 'uncooperative' attitude taken by a small \nsection living near the village of Baugy outside Lausanne. 101 \nIn general, the conference was a victory for Lenin. The Baugy Bolsheviks added an inflection \nto Luxemburg's argument which would have annoyed her. 104 \nBukharin came perilously close to repudiating the old Russian \nMarxist premise that Russia's next revolution would be a 'bour-\ngeois' one. This, as yet, was heresy for Lenin. This \nwas a powerful incentive to Lenin to dispel fractiousness. 106 Bukharin, in his \nown view, simply desired a switch of the party's focus of work from a \nRussian bourgeois revolution towards a European socialist revolu-\ntion; he did not deny that the forthcoming revolution in Russia \nwould be bourgeois. Lenin was the sort of theorist who, in the \nMiddle Ages, would have become cantankerous about the number of \nangels who could stand on the point of a needle, but for once he saw \nthe sense in amicably talking matters over with Bukharin at \nleisure. Indeed it was more their \nproject than Lenin's. Such collaboration was crucial if Lenin's Bolsheviks were to \nappear as something greater than a tiny Russian sect. After the Bern conference of Bolshevik emigres, Bukharin \nmoved to Scandinavia. Switzerland was so much the centre of \ninternational socialist debates in the war that Lenin may have seen \nBukharin's transfer as a mode of ridding himself of a rival. Scandinavia was bound to remain the main \nclandestine transit point for Bolshevik newspapers and correspon-\ndence en route to Russia; the linkmen and couriers for the Bolshevik \nCommittee had a marvellous opportunity to manipulate the Bol-\nshevik faction's activity. Perhaps Lenin trusted in Bukharin's \nmanifest good nature and continuing high regard for him. \nFurthermore, Lenin had other things to preoccupy him. Based in Brussels until 1914, it had \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhad to be evacuated to The Hague. 111 The obvious tactic for Lenin and Pannekoek was to \ncreate their own international co-ordinating body. A march had been stolen on Lenin. It was evident \nthat several non-Bolshevik Russian Marxists such as Martov and \nTrotski would also be invited. There was also the likelihood that the \nSocialist Revolutionaries would be present. Lenin's joy at the news \nwas not undiluted. 113 \n'THE NOTEBOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY' \nLenin's expressions of pleasure in 1915 were directed at matters more \narcane. When writing Materialism and Empiriocriticism in 1908-\n9, Lenin had been intellectually close to Plekhanov. His aim had been \nnot only to denigrate Aleksandr Bogdanov as a politician but also to \nindicate the kind of philosophy acceptable to Marxists: and \nPlekhanov's influence on Lenin's chapters had been strong. 114 Now \nPlekhanov represented everything Lenin found politically distasteful. His present objective was to discover \nwhat misinterpretations of Marxian epistemology and ontology had \nprovoked the alleged political betrayal made by Kautsky, Plekhanov \nand other leaders of the Second International in 1914. 115 The biography was completed by \nNovember; but Lenin had by then started to fill many new note-\nbooks on philosophy. 117 The fact that Lenin over-\nlooked the wartime writings of his adversaries indicates how deeply \nsubmerged he had become in his own theoretical quest. 120 Lenin \noverlooked Plekhanov's startling change of heart. It fell to Martov to \nattack Plekhanov in the press for undermining the 'scientific' \nprinciples of socialism with its amoral notions of historical inevit-\n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nability and impersonal socioeconomic forces. 126 This led Lenin to a further modification. 128 \nNone the less, Lenin also went beyond Plekhanov in 1915 by \nasserting that the validity of concepts and categories was testable \nonly by their usefulness when applied to real situations. 129 \nAn emphasis on practical experimentation was hardly new among \nRussian Marxists; it had been characteristic of Lenin's old philo-\nsophical adversary, Aleksandr Bogdanov, in Empiriomonism. Lenin now \nfocused on the universe's infinite complexity. A further contention of Lenin's \nreinforces this impression. But Lenin's work was committed to the \npages of his notebooks. \nYet the shift in Lenin's thought did not occur on all fronts. \nImportant differences between the respective standpoints of Lenin \nand Bogdanov anyway remained.) In addition, Lenin repeated that \nphilosophy was divided into two principal camps, materialism and \nidealism; 137 Bogdanov thought such affirmations to be neither \nprovable nor worthy of discussion. The old Lenin \nreappeared in his draft philosophical article of 1915, when he \ntriumphantly proclaimed the attainability of 'living, fruitful, true, \npowerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge'. \nThis matters for the fate of Soviet philosophy in ensuing decades. \nIn seeking to maintain the appearance of Marxist 'orthodoxy', \nwriters in the USSR through to the mid-1980s had to trace the \nlineage of their notions from Lenin. While exploring, \nLenin was bent on discovering what would be congenial for him. Lenin's \nphilosophical cerebrations did not precede and predetermine his \npolitics. He referred to a statement by the Russian democrat \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nD.", "Red_Army_1919": " 17 \nRed offensives had been resumed in March, April and May 1919, but \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n91 \nwere all repulsed. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Kun pleaded in vain for Red Army \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n103 \ndetachments. The Red \nArmy needed guns and munitions. On 25 September 1918, after the Red \nArmy had turned back the Czechoslovak Legion's invasion, he \nenjoined his fellow believers to recognise the authority of the Soviet \nstate so long as its orders did not contravene the dictates of their \nconsciences.", "Central_Party_1919": " On 25 March 1919 Zinoviev had complained to the Central \nCommittee that Trotski was ignoring the compromises on 'the military \nquestion' agreed by the Eighth Party Congress; and Lenin was asked to \nwrite to Trotski for redress. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July.24 The central party leadership, \nmoreover, was already exercised by geo-strategical considerations. Nikolai \nKrestinski on II January 1919 had been asked by the Central \nCommittee to clarify relations between the central party apparatus \non the one hand and the newly-formed republican governments, \nrepublican party bodies and even the People's Commissariat of \nNationality Affairs on the other. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia. The push for tight unification had grown \neven in the central party organs. The Politburo resolved on 13 December 1919 that \nonly with their sanction would the republic be established. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. His own greatest contribution came through his chairman-\nship of the central party and government bodies which presided over \nthe war effort. \nIn 1919 he dominated the affairs of Central Committee and \nPolitburo. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms. No party or governmental body came near to it in \nimportance.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. No faction in the party called for change apart from the \nemerging Workers' Opposition. Trotski inaugurated the debates \nin the central party leadership. In the Central \nCommittee, however, tempers flared. The party should campaign for freedom of \nconscience for all denominations; and Lenin's friend V. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But at the second session, on 30 March, the \nCentral Committee was rebuked. \nSapronov, the Democratic Centralist: 'In that case I put the question to \ncomrade Lenin: just who is it who will be appointing the C[entral] \nC[ommittee].'138 Sapronov prophesised that the result would be 'the \ndictatorship of the party bureaucracy' . Volin \nand others praised the Central Committee. Central Committee member \nM. 'Statification' was the \nparty's objective.161 Lenin left things to his \ncolleagues according to the pre-arrangement of the Central Committee. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. 169 In any case this was not a Central Committee of factions.", "Central_Party_1917": " 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. This intra-party \nphenomenon was observable throughout the Great War. As a result, they said, a 'party of leaders' had \nemerged rather than a 'mass party'. The German \nIndependent Social-Democratic Party, which included Kautsky in its \nleadership, was riven by factionalism, and its left-wing sections had \napproached the German Communist Party for co-operation.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends.37 This dubious prediction ignored the difficulties that a \nCommunist Party of Great Britain would experience in recruiting \nmembers if it forswore a role as rebel against the political status quo. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.67 A consensus had arisen \nthat the new communist parties in the colonies should preserve their \nindependence from other anti-imperial political groups. Evidently, if \nthe Communist International wanted such parties, it had to give them a \nrationale beyond helping the indigenous bourgeoisies to power.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo. By a vote \n The Tar in the Honey \n131 \nof 58 to 24 the British communists were told to join the Labour Party.95 \nIncreasingly the central party leaders recognised that their policies \nwould have a greater impact on society when refracted through the \nprism of an outstanding political figure.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. \nThe pressure-cooker had been under dangerous strain all year, and the \nstart of the Ninth Party Conference on 22 September 1920 was watched \nnervously by the central party leaders as the 116 delegates with voting \nauthority assembled. 146 Delegates \nwho had come to the Conference to rebuke the central party leadership \nas a whole witnessed a verbal brawl between two individual leaders, \nLenin and Stalin. Democratic Centralists T. Zinoviev stated bluntly: 'The chief conclusion \nof the proletarian revolution is the need for an iron, organised and \nmonolithic party. \nSapronov reiterated his complaints: about the organisational reprisals \nagainst the Democratic Centralists; about the secrecy surrounding the \ndiscussions of the local committees as well as the central party \napparatus; about the authoritarian methods rampant throughout the \nparty. Bureaucratic centralism reigned. The Democratic Centralists \nthought the standpoint of the Workers' Opposition, which called for \nworking-class rank-and-file party members to have a decisive impact \non policy and for the working class as a whole to control all economic \nproduction and distribution, was demagogy. Lutovinov and the \nWorkers' Opposition replied that the Democratic Centralists behaved \nno differently from supporters of Lenin in their local party \ncommittees. But \nthe Bolshevik party's claim to have hundreds of thousands of working-\nclass members was accompanied by the acknowledgement that most of \nthem had no active role in party life. Bukharin, too, \nsupported the notion of the party as the vanguard of the working \nclass and the central party apparatus as the vanguard of the party.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power. 'On the Proletkults', a central party \ncircular sent out on I December 1920, was written without the \nassistance of either him or any other sympathiser of the movement such \nas Anatoli Lunacharski. That it did not take place \nin the winter of 1920--1921 is attributable to the onset of the most \ndangerous political crisis confronting the party since the October \nRevolution.", "Central_Party_1921": " A Central Committee plenum \nmet on the Congress's last day, and appointed the new Politburo.8 Only at this stage did the \ncentral party leadership make its intentions fully public. The central \nparty apparatus had scrutinised and sanctioned the details. 39 Almost certainly the temporising was caused by \ndisagreements among central party leaders. Both continued to insist upon a strictly centralised, unitary \nparty.48 The rest of the central \nparty leadership, too, wanted to hold the republics of the Transcau-\ncasus to heel. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. His \npamphlet On The Food Tax and his subsequent speeches to the Tenth \nParty Conference, in May 1921, concentrated on domestic economics \nand politics at the expense of the international situation except insofar \nas he mentioned concessionaires. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. 126 239 delegates assembled \nin the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin on 26 May 1921 to hear their \nleadership's account of themselves. 138 Central \nCommittee member V. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 .' 173 The Eleventh Party Conference returned to such \nmatters in December 1921. When \nAdolf Joffe had written to him in this vein, he responded on 17 March \n1921 with text and verse on the difficulties he perennially faced in \ngetting his way: 'The old Central Committee (1919-1920) beat me \ndown on one of the most gigantically important questions, as you \nknow from the discussion [about the conflict between the Water-\nworkers Union and Tsektran in the early stage of the \"trade union \ncontroversy\"]. And the Politburo ruled the country in the interstices of the \nCentral Committee meetings. \nThe other central public institutions were subordinate to the party \napparatus. \nThe one central institution which, in his estimation, needed an \noverhaul was that same central apparatus of the party. The supervision of an emergent mixed economy \ndemanded that the central party organs should effect a masive increase \n Against the Wall \n221 \nin their control of the party in the provinces. 17 But Lenin was also comradely: 'We'll get \ntogether and we'll work amicably in the same party. On \n20 February 1922, the Politburo expelled him from the party.38 But a debate could not indefinitely be \npostponed: a questionnaire was issued to fraternal communist parties \nabout the prospects of revolution in the rest of Europe.40 This was in \nApril 1921. \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNext day they wrote to the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, still unapologetically describing the Action as a step \nforward for the communist movement. His \narguments for the New Economic Policy as delivered to the Tenth \nParty Conference in May 1921 were replicated with confidence. The boundary between what was pro-party and what \n 236 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwas anti-party was definable by reference to the party programme. Zinoviev presented the leadership's conclu-\nsions to the Twelfth Party Conference in August 1922 (while Lenin was \nrecuperating from a stroke). Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. The claim was outrageous that, from start to \nfinish, the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee had participated \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nactively in the counsels of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. The party was to be presented with \ndecisions and consulted only minimally; the first year of the New \nEconomic Policy, coming after the disputes of 1920-1921, had been a \nbattering experience. Lenin considered it vital that a united front \nshould be formed by the Central Committee, and had exerted himself \n Against the Wall \n249 \nto this end despite ill-health as preparations were made for the opening \nof the Eleventh Party Congress in Moscow on 27 March 1922. Party unity and loyalty to the line of the Central \nCommittee were the objective.211 The Central Committee was not given an easy time.216 An internal party grouping that should \nhave been ended its life in the previous year was far from being \nmoribund.", "Central_Party_1923": " The party leaders, with few exceptions, were exterminated. The party leadership \nhad brought this about. The cultural \nimperatives of the party were enormous. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Central Control \nCommission, staffed by workers and peasants, would learn to run the \nstate and improve its work; it would also, by delegating members to \nparticipate in Politburo sessions, supervise what went on in the central \nparty apparatus. There was 'bureaucracy' even in the party.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained.' 34 On 31 March the Central \nCommittee plenum supported the Politburo's position. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup. At the Thirteenth \nParty Conference in January 1924 his chances of breaking up the \nalliance of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev were blown to the winds. A \nsplit in the party, with Stalin and Trotski on opposing sides, was in the \nmaking; and Stalin consolidated his grasp on the Secretariat of the \nCentral Committee.", "Central_Party_1918": " The 'party-\nstate' was their invention. On coming to govern in October 1917, \nthey had expected to squeeze power in the party's fist. The party was ceasing to operate as a distinct \norganisation. At the \nSeventh Party Congress, Yakov Sverdlov as Central Committee \nsecretary had urged the imposition of 'iron discipline' and 'strict \ncentralism'. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. \nHe had said as much at the Seventh Party Congress in March 1918. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917. Only six out of fifteen full members \nof the Central Committee stayed in the capital in the second half of \n1918.12 Military exigency prevented the central party leadership from \ngathering regularly. They demanded that the party should recover its separate status \nand impose control over all public institutions. Kaganovich and Osinski argued in late 1918 that, if the \nparty was to run a centralised state efficiently, it needed to be efficiently \ncentralised itself. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. Indisputably the central party \nleadership had treated the rest of the party with a growing brusqueness. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst. \nBOLSHEVISM'S LEADER \nThis complacency about the Central Committee and its Secretariat was \ncoming under strain by the end of 1918. Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov.21 But the usefulness of inner subcommittees was not \ndenied, and a further experiment was undertaken in early October 1918 \nwhen a 'Bureau of the Central Committee' began to meet.22 On 16 \nJanuary 1919 the Central Committee met and established an \nOrganisational Bureau (or Orgburo) to take charge of internal party \nbusiness.23 The Orgburo quickly \nbecame a fixture in the central party apparatus. As things turned out, the \nCentral Committee met more often in the first months of 1919 than in \nprevious months; but this was not an unqualified bonus for Lenin.44 \nAnd yet he did not want the central party apparatus, despite their \nrivalry, to fall apart.49 \nSverdlov's death gave impetus for a re-organisation of the central \nparty apparatus. He was pre-\neminent in the Central Committee. Even the \nfact that the German Social-Democratic Party won more seats - 163 \nout of a possible 421 51 -\nthan any other party in the Constituent \nAssembly elections of January 1919 and formed a coalition with non-\nsocialist parties had the advantage that, in time, social-democrats could \nbe exposed as having connived in capitalism's survival. 52 \nThis attempt to sow dissent in the leadership of a rival party lay \nunpublished.56 \nHe arranged a meeting to take place on 21 January 1919 between \nCentral Committee representatives, led by himself and Trotski, and \nforeign communists working in Moscow. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The platform, accepted by the Congress on 4 March, \nsketched the proletariat's advance to the inauguration of socialism by \nbreaking with Kautskyism and overthrowing the bourgeois state \nmachine.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. A show of solidarity was needed in wartime. But even this exasperated \nTrotski, who sent a furious telegram to the central party leadership.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise.' as he delivered the Central \nCommittee's report. 107 The party had also had to feel its way in building a Red \nArmy. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants.' 110 \nThis indirect defence of the Central Committee was attacked by local \nleaders resenting the slights delivered to lower party bodies. \n Only One Year \n77 \nDemocratic Centralist N. 133 This was a massive defeat for the Central Committee.140 Lenin waded in. 148 Fellow Democratic Centralist \nT.

' 1 56 \nThe wrangling continued until exhausted delegates voted to hand the \ndraft resolution over to a commission for further editing.

But both of them were expecting to \nbe buffeted by complaints at the Eighth Party Congress.88 Such was \nhis confidence that he asked the Central Committee for permission to \nabsent himself from the Eighth Party Congress and return to deal with \nthe emergencies at the front.

For the programme accepted by the Eighth \nParty Congress was predominantly his programme.", "Bolshevik_Opposition_1919": " The decrees of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War must not \nbe treated as an accurate gauge of reality. Nor were Lenin and his colleagues \npusillanimous in the exercise of repression. Merciless struggle, \nmonolithic unity and and the strictest discipline were catch-phrases \nof Bolshevik public life. \nThere can equally be no doubt that the Bolsheviks were violent on a \nmassive scale even if not as comprehensively as was their officially-\nstated intention. After the Eighth Party \nCongress, Lenin and his colleagues informed local Bolshevik bodies \nthat an 'extraordinarily threatening danger' was posed from the east. The White army fled in chaotic fashion and mid-Siberia \nwas returned to Bolshevik rule. Lenin had spent the previous \nmonths calling for the forces of Kolchak to be fought and pursued \n88 \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n89 \nwithout mercy; but he did not want to appear responsible for \nKolchak's summary liquidation. He gave orders that any future official \nexplanation should suggest that local Bolsheviks were responding to a \nlocal emergency. Nor is he likely to have worried that, if the Reds \neven then lost the Civil War or if an anti-Bolshevik crusade from \nabroad succeeded, similar treatment might be meted out to him in \nretaliation; for he knew his deeds had already made him a marked \nman2 It may simply be that he wanted to persuade other White units to \nsurrender of their own volition.4 To the Eastern front political commissars, fighting \nKolchak, Lenin had written on 29 May 1919: 'If we haven't conquered \nthe Urals by the winter, I consider the doom of the Revolution \ninevitable. Lenin gave way, but not before precious time was lost in \nsecuring Petrograd's defences.9 \n 90 \nLenin: A Political Life \nEarlier spats had occurred among Politburo members; but Lenin had \navoided involvement. On 25 March 1919 Zinoviev had complained to the Central \nCommittee that Trotski was ignoring the compromises on 'the military \nquestion' agreed by the Eighth Party Congress; and Lenin was asked to \nwrite to Trotski for redress. Already in May 1919 there \nhad been signs that Lenin thought S. Lenin, with reservations but also with decisiveness, took \nthe side of Stalin and Zinoviev. Nevertheless Lenin would not go all the way with Stalin. Lenin emphasised this in an open letter on behalf of the \nCentral Committee on 9 July. On 3 July, as the Bolshevik Central Committee was having \nits frantic meeting in the capital, Denikin issued his Moscow Directive. \nThe Bolsheviks and their Red Army, almost to their own surprise, had \npulled off victory in the main theatre of conflict over the Russian \nempire. Lenin celebrated enthusiastically. The bulk of the population also lived under \nBolshevik rule. Very well, then: Bolshevik propaganda should be \ndiverted towards attracting their support. But they and Lenin had no illusions \nabout each other. \n 92 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Red Army ruthlessly secured dominance over its rivals. There were plenty \nof them, and Lenin's misjudgement about Petrograd was simply the \none he was personally and primarily responsible for. But he had made \nfewer than most of his colleagues; and those, like Kamenev, who \nforesaw difficulties more clearly than he, would never have led the \nBolsheviks to the party's satisfaction. \nGATHERING THE LANDS \nIt had been the ending of the Great War rather than any success \nagainst the Whites that had first brought Lenin and his colleagues back \nto deliberations on the 'national question' in the former Russian \nempire. The \nConstitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic (or \nRSFSR) drawn up in summer 1918 was extremely unspecific; and even \ndebate at the Eighth Party Congress had avoided specifying what \nrelations were to be pursued among the various republics. The creation of \nindependent Soviet republics had been initiated by Lenin. Vacietis, \nSupreme Commander of the Red Army, on 29 November 1918 \ninsisting that such a proliferation would 'remove the opportunity for \nthe chauvinists of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estland [i. Otherwise, \nLenin added, the troops of the Reds would not be treated as \n'liberators'. In \nthe winter of 1918-1919, Adolfloffe was sent to Belorussia to persuade \nlocal Bolsheviks that the RSFSR's interest would be served by a line of \n'buffer republics' between itself and powerful states to the west. 25 Their \nimmediate re-incorporation into an undisguisedly Moscow-based state \nmight instigate an even more British and French anti-Bolshevik \ncrusade than at present. Lenin kept a rein on policy. Leading local \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n93 \nBolsheviks in each Soviet republic were not easily reconciled to their \nown declarations of independence.27 \nBut these Bolsheviks did not control the Red Army. Without Lenin's \nassistance, they could not conquer their own countries. The policy of \nLenin, Stalin and Trotski had therefore to be accepted.28 But the only published elucidation \nwas the Party Congress decision to treat the Ukrainian, Belorussian, \nLithuanian and Latvian Communist Parties as regional party \norganisations subordinate to the authority of the Russian Communist \nParty in Moscow.29 \nThat a close formal link between the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics (and not just between party bodies) should be forged had \nbeen decided, but was not announced. The Central Committee on 16 \nJanuary 1919 had secretly ordered Bolsheviks in Belorussia to inititate \nnegotiations for a 'union' of all the republics, including Russia.30 \nEvidently Lenin did not want to be seen as an initiator. The fiction of \nnon-intervention by Moscow in non-Russian affairs had to be \nmaintained. For example, the Politburo on 23 \nApril 1919 resolved to ask the Ukrainian Bolshevik leadership to \nascertain how best 'a fusion of Ukraine with Soviet Russia might be \narranged'.31 Such language indicated that Lenin was yielding now to \nthe arguments of the Stuckas and the Mickeviciuses. \nFurthermore, the Bolsheviks in command of the other republics were \nnot always sensitive to national traditions - and often they carried \n 94 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthrough measures in total defiance of local society.32 For example, the \nUkrainian Bolsheviks had harassed the so-called middle peasantry and \ntried, in places, to impose collective farming by force. Consequently \nLenin may well have judged greater centralisation of authority to be \nless risky than letting the local Bolshevik-led governments enjoy much \nautonomy. Not that Lenin ever needed great encouragement to \ncentralise.33 \nUkrainian Bolshevik consent was also to be sought; and yet, even \nbefore treaty documents were signed, Lenin approved a directive to the \nparty leadership in Kiev stipulating that 'the People's Commissars of \nthe RSFSR should become People's Commissars of the Union with the \nPeople's Commissariats of Ukraine as their regional plenipotenti-\naries'. \nConsultations proceeded with Bolsheviks in the other republics. \nInstead, on 1 June 1919, a draft resolution was taken from Lev \nKamenev at the Politburo in favour of a 'military-economic union' of \nRussia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Belorussia. The Politburo controlled the entire \nparty and, despite occasions of serious disobedience, the Civil War \nwitnessed a strong insistence of authority on local Bolsheviks and \nconsequently on republic governments. In August 1919 Christian \nRakovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian Sovnarkom, was brusquely \nordered by the Politburo to close down several People's Commissariats \nand to dispense with a Ukrainian Council of Defence and Labour.36 A \ncontrast is sometimes drawn between Lenin and Stalin on basic aspects \nof the national question. Typically he \nwrote an open letter on 28 December 1919 stating that it was up to the \nworkers and peasants of Ukraine to determine 'exactly what federative \nlink' to have with Soviet Russia. But Lenin was disingenuous. Naturally he had no \nobjections to particular further measures which increased the power \nof Moscow vis-a-vis the republics. It was \nplanned by Stalin's Commissariat as early as 18 March 1918, but the \nbattles with the Whites in the Volga region and the Urals rendered it \nimpracticable for a whole year. 38 \nFurthermore, the Tartars against the expectations of the Bolsheviks \nproved to be aggressively self-assertive. As if this was not enough, the \nexiguous Bolshevik cadres in the Tartar-inhabited lands could not be \ncounted on to support the formation of a Tartar Republic along the \nmodel of Bashkiria.40 \nThe basic problem was that, as the Mensheviks had warned the \nBolsheviks before 1917, the former Russian empire was a quilt of \ninterstitched nationalities. No single ethnic group lived alone in a \nclearly demarcated zone; and, as often as not, the attempt to designate \n 96 \nLenin: A Political Life \nsuch zones aggravated inter-ethnic tensions. There was some \ncompensation for the Bolsheviks. Mirsaid Sultan \nGaliev, a rare Bolshevik from Tataria, had come to believe in the \nnecessity of a huge Turkic-speaking socialist state being carved out of \nthe Russian empire, larger even than the ill-fated Tartar-Bashkir \nRepublic. He also wanted aspects of Islam to be grafted on Bolshevik \nthought.44 \nLenin manifestly wanted to resolve the 'national question' within tight \nparameters. In addition, the non-Bolshevik members of the \nBashrevkom proved even more intractable in 1920 than in 1918-\n1919. Some who rebelled against Sovnarkom were put under arrest \nand, on Stalin's recommendation, transferred to Moscow prisons. \nOnly Lenin seriously opposed him. The aUiance between Stalin and Lenin on \nthe 'national question' which had held firm against criticism at the \nSeventh Party Conference of April1917 and the Eighth Party Congress \nof March 1919 was beginning to break apart. A \nclash between Lenin and Stalin might be postponed, but not \npermanently avoided. Just once Lenin took a trip to \nanother Russian city after the capital's transfer to Moscow in February \n1918: this was his sojourn in Petrograd in July 1920 for the start of the \nSecond Congress of the Communist Internationa1.48 Lenin had no \nmetropolitan prejudice. But he had an exceptional inclination towards \ncentralism, and assumed that his presence in Moscow was crucial to the \nsmooth running of the central political machinery. Old \n 98 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasant women in 1918-1920 would have provided him with little in \nthe way of politically supportive anecdotes. \nThis even occurred when Lenin, after the arrest of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in July 1918, visited their headquarters. Lenin \nand his sister Mariya were being driven by chauffeur Gil to the \nSokolniki district on the outskirts of Moscow to visit his wife \nKrupskaya. Lenin was not \ncompletely intimidated. Rather he was astounded, and shouted out to \nthem: 'My name is Lenin. Lenin had further humiliation in store. They sought mercy on the grounds that they had assumed \nthey were robbing someone calling himself Levin rather than Lenin. After all, the Bolshevik \nparty was committed to the eradication of anti-semitism (and, although \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n99 \nthe fact was not bruited, Lenin was anyway part-Jewish by descent). Lenin joked about his surrender of pistol \nand wallet to the gang in terms borrowed from the lexicon of Marxism: \n'Such a compromise was akin to our compromise with the bandits of \nGerman imperialism. Lenin's telegram \nto Trotski ran as follows: 'In connection with the coded telegram from \nthe three commanders of the Eastern front I propose we should \nappoint [S. '59 \nYet his interference was limited mainly to emergencies; he recognised \nthat Trotski, Stalin and other Bolshevik commissars at the fronts had \nto take decisions without automatic detailed consultation with \nMoscow. Lenin was the motor of the political machinery. In accordance with arrangements made in the previous \n 100 \nLenin: A Political Life \nyear, the central party bodies constituted the apex of the state's \ndeliberative and decision-making mechanisms.60 \nLenin habitually chaired Politburo sessions. Lenin's colleagues appear \nto have treated them as reassurance that someone in the Kremlin cared \nabout them and their work.6s But Lenin was among several \ncentral party colleagues who insisted. Lenin's refusal of \ntitles, awards and celebrations was to some extent a self-regarding \ntactic. Lenin was genuinely devoid of vanity. Lenin was a fellow of simple habits. He went shooting in the forests with leading Bolsheviks. His only friends were Bolsheviks. \n 102 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNearly all were comrades rather than friends. \nEXPORT OF REVOLUTION, SIEGE ECONOMY \nThe activities of Lenin and his associates in 1919 demonstrate that, \nafter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the party still adhered to its objective \nof European socialist revolution.66 \nLenin also wished to supply military assistance to the extent that the \nRed Army was capable.68 He and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership had been \nequally cheered by the communist seizure of power in Munich. It was beginning to look as if the \npredictions made by Lenin in 1917 were coming true.'69 \nAlready, however, the Hungarian and Bavarian Soviet Republics \nappeared fragile, and Lenin sensed that the Hungarian comrades were \ntoo reckless for their own good. Lenin defended his \ncolleagues; but the sole counsel he could give was as follows: 'Hold on \nfor all you are worth, and ours shall be the victory.'74 \nLenin was wrong about this: the Hungarian Soviet Republic was \noverthrown by late August and Bela Kun fled to Moscow. Yet Lenin \nwas right in his caution about international relations in the Baltic \nregion. Not only did he and Chicherin aim to avoid giving offence to \nthe Allies; they also strained to minimise the involvement of the \nindependent states in the anti-Bolshevik military operations of the year. The matter came before the Politburo on II September, and \nit took all the pressure that Lenin could muster to secure a decision to \nend the condition of war with Latvia and Lithuania as well as with \nFinland. Lenin's \ndifficulty lay in countering the arguments of the 'native' communist \nleaders of the Baltic region who wanted to keep their respective \ncountries on the agenda of revolutionary expansion. But Lenin pulled \nthe Politburo to his pragmatic viewpoint. 76 Chicherin opposed on the grounds that such a policy \nwould destroy the impression, eagerly cultivated by Soviet diplomacy, \nthat the Russian republic was uninterested in extending socialism to \n 104 \nLenin: A Political Life \nforeign states on the point of a bayonet. Initially he had \nLenin's support.78 But subsequently Lenin agreed with Trotski that \nYudenich should not only be driven back from Petrograd but also be \nsought out and liquidated as a military force. A breach in the wall of \ninternational capitalism, Lenin felt, had been obtained. \nThrough summer 1919 Lenin kept a discreet silence about Allied \nintentions.82 \nJust as he had not highlighted the danger from the Allies in mid-\n1919, so Lenin eschewed any welcome for the lifting of the blockade. Precisely this was said by Lenin in \nan interview with the Christian Science Monitor in September 1919.84 Nevertheless, knowing the unpopularity \nof concessions and being busy with a thousand other duties, Lenin left \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n105 \nit to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade to draw up a detailed \nplan in January.86 \nSo what on earth was Lenin up to. This \nhad never disappeared from his calculations; and, to his satisfaction, it \nhad also become the viewpoint of most of his Left Communist \nopponents of 1918. Lenin and his colleagues were disappointed by \nevents in Munich and Budapest in 1919. Lenin was a stealthy, sinuous politician. Strikes \n 106 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbroke out all over the areas controlled by the Russian Soviet republic.92 In general the Politburo- as well as all \nthe state agencies which were subordinate to it - maintained the \ndevelopment of policies from 1918. He emphasised the role to be played by the trade unions as a \ncounterweight to the Bolshevik party. But it was a sign of Lenin's \nconfidence that he refrained from comment on Workers' Oppositionist \nnotions.96 \nInitiative in foreign and military affairs came often from Lenin, but \nnot in relation to the economy in 1919.98 Lenin ostensibly felt likewise.99 This was a long way from endorsing \nlabour armies as a main durable agency of post-war reconstruction, \nand exemplified the disjunction between the thinking of Lenin and \nTrotski. Militarisation of labour, for Lenin, was a regrettable necessity \nand not a policy to glory in. 100 \nLenin and Trotski gave their speeches on the issues without naming \neach other in dispute; the tone was comradely. Grain requisitioning was the cornerstone of \nBolshevik wartime policy: the idea that a private market in wheat and \nrye might return was anathema to the party's leaders. Lenin was so \ninfuriated that he accused Trotski of supporting 'Free Trade-ism'. 104 But \n 108 \nLenin: A Political Life \non this occasion Trotski did not fight his corner. Lenin had won the \ndebate, and Trotski chose to concentrate on his work in the Red Army \nand areas of economic policy where he could get Lenin to compromise \nwith him. Surveys carried out in the mid-1920s were to show \nthat the great majority of the Russian population remained Christian \nby belief; and the Bolsheviks knew that in the peripheral zones of the \nold empire - in the Ukraine, the Baltic region, Georgia and Armenia -\ndevotion to national denominations had been unaltered by the calls of \nthe party to abandon the faith. Most citizens of the Soviet republic ruled \nover by the godless Lenin were believers. His Land Decree at the Second Congress of \nSoviets had expropriated all the landed property of the Russian \nOrthodox Church, and his Basic Law on the Socialisation of the Land \nin February 1918 had confirmed this_l 06 The intention was that, by \nundermining the economic resources of religious institutions, popular \nbelief in God (or god, as Lenin put it) would be foreshortened. 111 \nTikhon wanted the Reds to be defeated and did not withdraw his \nanathema on them; but his aim was to facilitate the Church's survival \nuntil such time as Lenin's government fell from office. Lenin \nappreciated the potential of the Patriarchate as a focus for anti-\nBolshevik opposition. On 20 October \n1918, at the First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers, he argued \nthat excessive zeal in the extirpation of 'religious prejudices' would be \ncounterproductive. 112 At the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919 he suggested that the Bolsheviks would merely give rise to \nfanaticism if offence was given to the beliefs of Christians. Lenin was \ncunning. 114 It is highly improbable that Lenin strongly disapproved. liS Behind \nthe scenes, Lenin blatantly fomented anti-religious violence. A \ntelegram from him to the Penza Soviet Provincial Executive \nCommittee on 9 August 1918 may well be the tip of a bloodstained \niceberg: 'Received your telegram.' 116 \n 110 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Russian Orthodox Church was the one remaining institution \ncapable of rallying most ethnic Russians against Sovnarkom and was \nsingled out for maltreatment by the Cheka. As early as 1903, at \nthe Second Party Congress, Lenin had brought the 'sects' to the party's \nattention. Their grievances against the Romanov autocracy, he argued, \nshould be used by Marxists as a means of strengthening the struggle \nagainst Nikolai II. The party should campaign for freedom of \nconscience for all denominations; and Lenin's friend V. 120 Lenin's attentiveness was little greater \ntowards Islam. On 20 November 1917 he and Stalin had co-signed a \nproclamation to 'all labouring Moslems of Russia and the East' which \nguaranteed their freedom to worship; 121 Lenin also warned at the \nEighth Party Congress in March 1919 against offending Muslim \nsensibilities, and declared that the influence of the mullahs in central \nAsia was even greater than the influence of priests in Russia. But one factor must surely come \ninto the reckoning: this is that the Bolsheviks were already regarded by \nmany Russian Orthodox Christians as a gang of marauding Jews. Almost certainly Lenin did not want to inflame Russian \npopular opinion by siding too openly with religious believers who did \nnot belong to Russia's national church. His decrees of 1917 and the \nSoviet Constitution of July 1918 had promulgated freedom of \nconscience in the Soviet republic. \nIn Lenin's defence it could be said that religious persecution was not \nconfined to the actions of the Reds. Lenin was fighting a Civil War; he would rather over-\nrepress than risk leaving opponents the chance to counter-attack. 125 \nNor was he the most avid advocate of militant atheism among the \nBolshevik party leaders. 26 Lenin won the day. Even so, he continued to \nhave to protect his position against Bolsheviks with ideas more extreme \nthan his own. But Lenin had yet to determine \nhow his government should tackle the question of religion. He sensed a particular \npotential menace in the growing attractiveness of the works of the ex-\nBolshevik Aleksandr Bogdanov (whom Lenin since 1908 had charged \nwith the 'heinous' offence of philosophical idealism) to some of his \nclose party co11eagues. \nLenin, welcoming the 553 voting delegates to the Bolshoi Theatre on 29 \nMarch 1920, exulted: 'The internal development of our revolution has \nled to the greatest, quickest victories over the enemy in the civil war \nand, because of the international situation, these victories have turned \nout nothing less than a victory of the soviet revolution in the weakest \nand most backward country, a victory over united global capitalism \nand imperialism.' 133 In fact the Bolsheviks had yet again been \nmisinformed. Lenin gave the Central \nCommittee's political report, emphasising that the Politburo 'had \n And Ours Shall Be the Victory \n113 \nresolved all questions of international and domestic policy'. But he urged that Bolsheviks in the \nmeantime should look on the bright side and get on with 'the peaceful \ntasks of economic construction'. 136 \nNikolai Krestinski followed Lenin with the Central Committee's \norganisational report. \nSapronov, the Democratic Centralist: 'In that case I put the question to \ncomrade Lenin: just who is it who will be appointing the C[entral] \nC[ommittee]. Kaganovich pleaded for greater \ncentralist severity did the tirades against Lenin relent.142 Trotski, turning to the \nUkraine-based opponents of the central party apparatus, questioned \ntheir own efficiency by claiming that, out of every hundred activists \nthey mobilised to the Red Army, 'five went and ninety deserted.'143 \nKrestinski did not trade insults, 144 1eaving it for Lenin to summarise \nthe case for the Central Committee. 'It is necessary,' declared Lenin in sprawling \nchunks of rhetoric, 'it is necessary to be able to grasp that we are now \nfaced with a practical task, that we must deal with the businesslike task \nof the quickest victory over collapse and ruin with all the forces, with \nthe genuinely revolutionary energy, with the uncompromising zeal with \nwhich our best comrades- the workers and peasants in the Red Army-\ndefeated Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. 146 At session three, the same evening, Trotski \nkept up the non-apologetic style with his report on 'economic \n 114 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconstruction'. 151 But Lenin \nrepaid Trotski's assistance to him. He also quoted from his 1918 \npamphlet The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. 163 Lenin had less reason to thank his \ncolleagues in the other section. 164 His demarche was a \nreminder that even the more cautious Bolsheviks were yet Bolshe-\nviks: Milyutin overlooked peasant attitudes to nationalisation. 165 At this point Lenin, who had \nheard of the spat only the night before, intervened against Milyutin \nwhom he accused of being impractical and ignorant of Lenin's ideas. But it was an accurate assessment of Lenin's status: the Congress \n 116 \nLenin: A Political Life \nreversed the section's choice and took Krestinski's draft theses as the \nbasis of its resolution. 168 \nNo Party Congress had gone so smoothly for Lenin. Lenin was unconcerned that \nleaders closer to Trotski than to him -\nA. Sergeev: each of them preferred Lenin \nto Trotski. \nLenin confidently roused the Congress with his final oration. Finishing his remarks on the \neconomy, Lenin triumphantly proclaimed: 'We shall manage to resolve \nthis problem just as victoriously as we resolved the military problem, \nand shall proceed quickly and firmly to the victory of the Worldwide \nSocialist Soviet Republic.", "Bolshevik_Opposition_1922": " Prominent Bolsheviks were not \nunusual in trying to hide away the altercations among themselves. Most \npeople knew next to nothing about the Bolshevik wrangling about the \nNew Economic Policy; and the rumours about dissension in the party, \nwhich had came to the ears of those observers with friends in the \nparty's higher echelons, were dying down. And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. There were rows about foreign trade, about state \nbureaucracy, about the Soviet constitution, about party administration \nand even about the division of responsibilities among these same \ncolleagues. \nBolshevik leaders, including Lenin, were irked that a retreat from \nsupposedly socialist policies had been forced upon them. Not only Lenin and Trotski but also the rest \nof the Politburo peppered their public statements with references to the \nFrench Revolution and its eventual retreat from ideological radicalism. \nThe possibility that the New Economic Policy might initiate a counter-\nrevolution from within was in their thoughts and was sustained by the \nstridency of attacks made by non-Bolshevik Russians in emigration \nwho predicted this very denouement. \nLenin's illness reduced the chances for differences of opinion \nremaining amicable in the Politburo.5 Even so, Lenin kept his own pessimistic \ncounsel.7 \n 258 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe central party leaders surveyed these developments carefully, \ndeciding to make no public announcement. By then the Politburo \nwas facing difficulty in explaining Lenin's protracted absence from \nMoscow.10 \nLenin had always been attentive about his health.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. \nMaksim Gorki heard from Lenin about the pains in his head; his sister \n Testament to a Revolution \n259 \nMariya remarked how savage they had become by the winter of 192(}-\n1921. On that occasion Lenin had tried to \nmake little of his difficulty: 'My leg's tired, I've got pins and needles.'16 \nThese were to be hints for Osipov that Lenin had almost certainly \nsuffered a series of mild strokes. The novelty was that Lenin now urged that Rykov and \nTsyurupa should use the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (or \nRabkrin) as their main administrative apparatus of supervision.22 Lenin irritatedly replied on 5 May, defending Rabkrin and \nrejecting Trotski's demands about the State Planning Commission. \nTrotski and Lenin argued as if it could be taken for granted that \nLenin would shortly return to his political jobs. The scheme proposed \nby him was carefully limited to the matter of his Sovnarkom deputies \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand their functions. The Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic's most \nreluctant f. Another hypothesis was that Lenin was suffering merely \nfrom massive over-work.30 \nThere was another potential diagnosis which the Politburo withheld \nfrom public deliberations: namely that Lenin had syphilis. As yet we cannot say beyond peradventure \nthat Lenin was not suffering from it.37 This perfectly characterised Lenin's circumstances. \nYet Lenin simply could not understand a life outside politics.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke. Valentinov also noted that, in the pre-revolutionary \nyears, it was usually a crisis in politics which precipitated the elation or \nthe depression in Lenin. The various trade treaties obtained by the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic were encouraging; but the unilateral \nabrogation of the debts contracted by Nikolai II and the Provisional \nGovernment had inhibited potential investment. \nSeveral leading Bolsheviks began to argue that the business of \nimports and exports therefore be partially denationalised.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation. \nLenin objected in writing to Kamenev that there was nothing wrong \nwith the monopoly if only adequate 'terror' were to be applied to those \nforeigners who were 'buying up our officials with bribes' .49 Lenin's summer \nconvalescence gave the proponents of denationalisation their chance. Trotski, like Lenin, \nwas hostile to the repeal of the state monopoly. 5\u00b0 If Lenin and Trotski \nhad trusted each other better, things might have been different. Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski. Since its inception, he had stressed that the New \nEconomic Policy should involve the maintenance of state control over \ntrade; and he saw terrible dangers in any lessening of control: 'A \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspecialist-smuggler at the frontier is one thing; but it is entirely another \nmatter to have the entire peasantry which will defend itself as a whole \nand fight against any authority trying to deprive it of its \"own\" \nprofit'.s9 \nActive supporters of Lenin in the party leadership's front rank were \nfew. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. The severe aches and pains returned on 25 November, and \nLenin was incapacitated. Mariya Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] said not to \nbother him with anything- and that, if he himself enquires after the \nanswers, to ask whomever is appropriate.'67 The doctors this time were successful in their \ninsistence: Lenin was to stop work absolutely for a whole week.70 Lenin was a tough old bird and in \nfact kept on working; but on 13 December, at eleven o'clock in the \nmorning, his doctors advised that he would be seriously at risk if his \ndisobedience continued. By midday on 12 \nDecember Lenin had made up his mind to ask Trotski for support.73 To Lenin's delight, Trotski replied \npositively the same day. \nLenin had turned the tables on them. Lenin sent it a letter rejecting the criticisms ofKrasin \nmade by Bukharin, who had emerged as the theorist among those \ncalling for the abolition of the state monopoly.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership. \nTrotski had been highly suspect to Lenin since the 'trade union \ncontroversy', and Stalin had been among Lenin's most valuable \nsupporters in limiting the influence of the party's left wing.81 \nLenin's health problems in the winter of 1921-1922 had pushed him \ncloser and closer to Stalin. Vyacheslav Molotov was \npolitically more reliable for Lenin than his trio of predecessors: \nKrestinski, Serebryakov and Preobrazhenski.82 \nLenin needed a new Sverdlov, and he thought Stalin would fit the bill \ndespite the unsettled relations between them in the past. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. In 1920, \nmoreover, Lenin had objected to the maverick behaviour of Stalin in \nthe Red Army's invasion of Poland. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress.86 In any case, bad blood had not come \nbetween Lenin and Stalin; as yet their disputes had been kept within the \nbounds of a party which thrived on polemics. Just such a colleague - a colleague who had \nappeared to concur with Lenin on most fundamental current issues -\nwas to Lenin's liking as he himself made arrangements for his \nconvalescence.90 At \nthe plenum of the Central Committee it was Lenin who intervened to \nput minds at rest.91 This was not the \nsuggestion of someone who opposed Stalin's appointment.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time.94 Lenin on this occasion was \nignored by his colleagues. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. He wished to allay any suspicion \nharboured by Lenin that the Politburo was doing things which, if he \nhad been fit, would have incurred Lenin's displeasure. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin.99 Lenin put Stalin at his ease. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. \nThe only notable discomfiture in the conversations between Lenin \nand Stalin was not of Stalin's making. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. Why had Lenin chosen his political colleague for this \nmission. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. Lenin and Martov had belonged to \nthe same St Petersburg Marxist organisation in the 1890s; they had \nfounded the newspaper Iskra together in the emigration in 1900. \nSubsequently they had fallen out: Lenin the Bolshevik struggled \nagainst Martov the Menshevik. \nRevealing what had passed between him and Lenin, he asked them \nwhat he should do. Lenin perked up a little at this and asked: 'Are you up to some \ncunning.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. He himself had \nalways had ambitions as a theorist as well as an administrator, and \nevidently thought his writings on the national question to be a \nsubstantial contribution to a growing revolutionary corpus; and, while \nStalin could not match the flashes of inspiration in the humanities and \nthe social sciences displayed by Trotski and Bukharin, there is little in \nthe work of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Pyatakov or any other outstanding \nBolshevik politician which put them out of his intellectual class. \nLenin's overt friendliness to Stalin was anyway predicated upon \nneed. 110 \nKamenev's refusal to pick up the anti-Stalin banner was the final \ninducement for Lenin to turn towards Trotski. Their past disagreements had once provoked \nTrotski to shout at Lenin that he was a 'hooligan' at a Politburo \nmeeting. 112 This self-restraint \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmight now pay dividends. Lenin was choosing him \nin the absence of a sensible and reliable alternative and was giving no \nguarantee that, should his own health be restored to him, he would not \nrevert to a more cautious relationship. He had his greatest impact when \nworking with the approval of Lenin. The October Revolution and the \nCivil War had brought them together, and Lenin was inviting Trotski \nto resume close collaboration. \nTHE GEORGIAN AFFAIR \nLenin's rumblings in the dispute over foreign trade were a pallid \nrehearsal of his volcanic eruption about the new Constitution. A \nCongress of Soviets was due to be held in late December, and its \nproceedings were expected to define the relations between Russia and \nthe other Bolshevik-led republics of the former Russian empire. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. \nLenin still desired a multi-republican federation wherein the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic was a constituent republic alongside \nthe other Soviet republics; Stalin continued to call for the other Soviet \nrepublics simply to be pulled into the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet \nRepublic with rights of regional autonomy. Tensions \nbetween Moscow and the non-Russian republics increased in 1921-\n1922, with Ukraine and Georgia being especially annoyed by the \nprovisions of the treaties they had signed with the RSFSR. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. The Georgian Bolsheviks \nstrenuously objected to Stalin's proposal that the Georgian republic \nshould be incorporated in a Transcaucasian Federation (which in turn \nwould enter the RSFSR). Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 117 A \nregional federal authority should be able to forestall inter-republican \nstrife; and, much as the Georgian Bolshevik leaders felt done down by \nthis, they had not always shown attitudes typical of socialist \ninternationalism. The Georgian Bolsheviks had even \nwished to introduce a law on citizenship which would discriminate \nheavily against the several non-Georgian minorities in the republic. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. 119 \nWhere the Georgian Bolsheviks failed, however, the party leadership \nin Ukraine had some success. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. Lenin's guard was lowered by a \nnumber of factors. There is no sign that Stalin's 'autonomisation' \nproject was discussed by Lenin and Stalin at the Gorki sanatorium in \nthe summer. The result was that, despite their vehement disagreement \nin 1920, Lenin remained confident that Stalin would yield to him: only \ngradually did he conclude that the General Secretary was not only \nintransigent but even devious on the matter. \nAfter the Russo-Ukrainian flurry and Lenin's stroke the question \nwas again pushed into the background. Only on 10 August, weeks \nbefore Lenin returned to work in the Kremlin, did the Politburo \ninstruct the Orgburo to 'prepare the question of the interrelationships \nbetween the RSFSR and the independent republics'. In addition, all matters of finance, trade, industry, \nsecurity, transport, communications, food supplies and military \norganisation would be handled directly by the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic; and no national appellation other than the \nword 'Russian' was to appear in the union's title. 129 \nThe decks were cleared for a struggle between Lenin and Stalin; and \nStalin, quite apart from having the advantage of being fit and active, \nfelt that he had reason on his side and that the party would support \nhim. The memory of Lenin's difficulties on the 'national question' in \n1917-1919,130 when Stalin had been mainly on his side, reinforced \nStalin's intuition that Lenin would lose this time. 133 The Armenian Central Committee took \nthe same line five days later; and on 16 September the party's \nTranscaucasian Regional Committee confirmed this on behalf of \nBolsheviks in Armenia, Azerbaidzhan and Georgia. 136 \nEven the Armenian party was less than ecstatic about Stalin's \nproposals, asking that the republics should explicitly be accorded \n'broad autonomy' within the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic \nand that time should be set aside to prepare the population for what \nwas to happen. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'. 139 \nThere was a tacit reluctance among local Bolsheviks to accept the \nstatus of mere 'autonomous republics' for their territories. They did not \nwant to ape the model of the Bashkir Republic within the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. \nPetrovski from the Ukraine was similarly unhappy, and Armenia's \nrepresentative Lukashin was disconcerted by Stalin's brusqueness \nabout the rights of the republics in the future federal order. 143 It was at \nthis point that Lenin came back into the reckoning. The new federation was to be called \nthe Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia and not the Russian \n Testament to a Revolution \n279 \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. 147 \nIf Stalin underestimated Lenin's determination, others did not. Lenin would see to that. Taken slightly aback, \nStalin scribbled: 'I don't know.'149 \nLenin had got his tail up.'150 By this he meant not \nonly Russians in his party who overlooked the wishes of the non-\nRussians in the general population but also non-Russian Bolsheviks \nwho were similarly insensitive. Lenin was well enough \nto attend, but had to withdraw at midday because of toothache. 152 Kamenev and Bukharin \ntook up the torch from Lenin and denounced the seepage of \nchauvinism into the Soviet state's activities. \nThe members included Stalin, Kamenev, Pyatakov, Rykov, Chicherin \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Kalinin as well as representatives from each of the non-Russian \nrepublics. 154 \nStalin in any case saw that Lenin was not properly recovered. When \nLenin returned to chair Sovnarkom on 3 October, an agreement held \namong its members to avoid controversy lest he become agitated. (In \nfact he became a lot more agitated because of this plot of gentility \nagainst himl)155 Stalin also knew that the Georgian Bolshevik leaders' \nhostility to being included in a Transcaucasian federation still cut no \nice with Lenin. 157 At a meeting of the Transcaucasian \nRegional Committee of the Bolshevik party, Ordzhonikidze referred to \nthem as 'chauvinistic filth' .158 The Mdivani group's complaint reached \nLenin's ears, but he replied that he was amazed at the improper tone of \ntheir criticisms of Ordzhonikidze. \nOrdzhonikidze delightedly complied, referring to the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition as a 'Menshevik deviation' . Lenin did not \nsympathise with them, and Kamenev and Bukharin wrote to them \ncondemning their action. 163 In vain did the resigners \nwrite to Lenin protesting the justice of their cause.164 As yet Lenin, \nwhile not liking Stalin's attitudes, thought that his actions were \njustified. And Stalin showed his guile by acceding to the demand of the \nGeorgian Bolshevik dissenters for an investigative mission to be sent to \nTbilisi. The dissentient Georgian Bolsheviks nervously \nawaited their fate. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests. 169 \nLenin in Moscow was beginning anyway to see the need to keep an \neye on Stalin.172 Lenin was appalled. The opening \nwords were portentous: 'Evidently I am deeply guilty before the \nworkers of Russia inasmuch as I failed to intervene with sufficient \nvigour and sufficent sharpness in the notorious question of \n\"autonomisation\", officially designated, it seems, as the question of \nthe union of soviet socialist republics.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. 177 This was ratified at a Congress of Soviets of the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic. The Georgian Bolsheviks had \nbeen defeated. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. The Bolshevik \nparty leadership had been casual in drafting legislation; they were \nactivists and wanted action, not fine laws which could never be broken. \nThey were also collectivists and, although no one doubted that Lenin \nhad enjoyed a predominant political position, he had no formal title to \nthis effect within the party. \nThe only leader who could broach the question was Vladimir Ilich \nLenin himself, and it was typical of his tough-mindedness that he \ndetermined to do so. His main worry was the \ndurability of the party's rule over society in a world of states hostile to \nthe Soviet republic. Trotski was the renowned co-instigator \nof the October Revolution, Zinoviev headed the Executive Committee \nof the Communist International and Kamenev was chairman of the \nMoscow Soviet. 182 Lenin's perspicaciousness was dipping here. \nRykov and Tsyurupa, who had figured in his planning for the re-\norganisation of the governmental machinery, were rightly excluded \nfrom the list even though they were prominent politicians with much \n 284 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncurrent power. Lenin knew that they lacked the weight to affect the \nbalance of authority in political conflicts. Few \nBolsheviks outside the Politburo membership would have judged him \nto be any more worthy of inclusion than Pyatakov. Stalin, moreover, was thought to lack \ncompetence as a theorist - a major failing in a Bolshevik leader of that \nepoch. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. A party split, he asserted, was the greatest threat to the \nsurvival of the Soviet republic. 183 \nNone of the six colleagues came out well from Lenin's comments. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). On Bukharin, \nLenin's comments were equally astringent.' Lenin was merciless: 'He has \nnever studied and, I think, never fully understood dialectics. Lenin had concluded that not \none of his highly-placed colleagues was worthy to succeed him. Lenin, despite believing in the popular accessibility of \nMarx's ideas, was blithely asserting that the party's second greatest \ntheorist had basically misconceived the nature of Marxism. \nLenin did not claim that the plan was a panacea. This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. \nIn late December, too, Lenin asked Krupskaya to confide the message \nto Trotski that his feelings towards him since Trotski had escaped from \nSiberia to London in 1902 had not changed and would not change \n'until death itselr. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin. And his avoidance of the analysis of character was \naccompanied by an inclination to trace the potential for a party split \nto general factors of the environment of politics after the October 1917.' 189 \nThis cumbersome remark was meant to indicate that Trotski and \nStalin might eventually find themselves on opposing sides in a dispute \nabout the rival claims on the party's favour on behalf of the working \nclass and the peasants. 'But I hope,' Lenin added, as if chiding himself \nfor his gloomy thoughts, 'that this is an all too distant future and an all \ntoo improbable event to talk about.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. The alienation of most workers from \nthe party was already a commonplace of Bolshevik thought, and nearly \nall peasants were either too exhausted or too ignorant to take the \nSoviet regime seriously. Lenin's bipartite summary of the party's \ndependence on the two classes, furthermore, omitted to mention its \nreliance on the sprawling administrative stratum in order to maintain \nits own 'stability'. Lenin foresaw that a schism was possible \nsimply over issues of personal jealousy and ambition. Evidently Lenin aimed to have an independent source of \ninformation: yet another sign that he took nothing and no one, not \neven his new ally Trotski, for granted. Lenin reeked nought of this. '201 Krupskaya kept the incident secret from Lenin, \nhowever, on the grounds that he might be upset. \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThat Stalin could have lost his own self-control to the extent of bad-\nmouthing his leader's wife and comrade is remarkable. It may be that, \nas was rumoured about him not long afterwards, he had already \nconcluded that Lenin's life was fast drawing to its close and that he had \nnothing to lose. Perhaps he judged that 'Lenin is kaput' . But he also knew about Lenin's resilience. \nThe struggle over foreign-trade policy continued to exercise the minds \nof the Bolshevik leaders. Lenin was still a dangerous and important \npiece on the chess-board. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.205 Lenin evidently was intent on some political \nreform, and no one had more to lose from this than Stalin. The \nSoviet leader, hated by his enemies at home and abroad as the Red \ndictator, did not take easily to dictation of the literary kind.215 It was Volodicheva \nwho took down the six thumbnail sketches of Bolshevik leaders. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session. All three were friends, and Lenin must surely have trusted \nthem implicitly.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command. In their later lives they were wiJiing \npolitical handmaidens unto Stalin; and there is definite evidence that at \nleast Glyasser took an anti-Trotski position in the controversies of \n1923.218 \nNothing can yet be proved, but it would not be totally surprising if \nthese young women, squeezed in a vice of contrary loyalties and \nsensing that Lenin would not last much longer, continued to yield \ninformation to Stalin.", "Communist_International_Congress_1917": " The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. Deliberations on both the Second \nCongress of the Communist International and several wrangles over \npersonnel preceded the item on the telegram from Lord Curzon. \n'THE INFANTILE DISEASE OF\"LEFTISM\" IN COMMUNISM' \nIn April and May 1920, in advance of the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, Lenin composed a pamphlet of thirty \nthousand words. This is exactly what was best known about him among the \nCommunist International delegates already assembling for the \nCongress in Moscow.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. \nAn electoral pact would enable the communists to gain a few \nparliamentary seats. \nNevertheless The Infantile Disease of 'Leftism' was a milestone in the \ndevelopment of international communism. Plainly he wished to subject all Communist International \nparties to firm discipline. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.3 \nTHE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERNATIONAL \nDelegates to the Second Communist International Congress congre-\ngated in Moscow in summer 1920 and, in deference to Petrograd's \nstatus as the birthplace of the October Revolution, they took the train \nto the north and assembled in the Smolny Institute on 19 July 1920. The \nCommunist International would be able to bring the sincere but misted \nleftists of central and eastern Germany to their senses.49 \nBut it was Julian Marchlewski from the Communist Workers' Party of \nPoland that made the Congress look closely at the current military \ncampaign in Poland. Moreover, he insisted that the Congress should formulate a policy \nmandatory for all member parties of the Communist International. The Congress was exhilarated, and delegates \nwere inhibited from protesting against Zinoviev's theses. 55 Nor did it \nharm Lenin's interests at the Congress that the entire third session, \nwhich followed on 24 July, was given up to disputes among the foreign \nparties.57 Yet he did not quite get a clear path from the \nCommunist International delegates. His modified submission \nto the Communist International Congress demanded that support be \ngiven to the 'revolutionary movement' in colonies and not to the \n'bourgeois-democratic liberation movement'. At the Congress he stated for the first \ntime explicitly that 'the Communist International should advance and \ntheoretically establish the proposition that, with the assistance of the \nproletariat of the advanced countries, the rest of the countries can \nmove over to the soviet system and - through certain stages of \ndevelopment - towards communism while by-passing the capitalist \nstage of development.67 A consensus had arisen \nthat the new communist parties in the colonies should preserve their \nindependence from other anti-imperial political groups. Evidently, if \nthe Communist International wanted such parties, it had to give them a \nrationale beyond helping the indigenous bourgeoisies to power.70 \nNext day, at session six, Zinoviev reported on the conditions of \nadmission to the Communist International.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo.80 Not until4 August, in session thirteen and over two \nweeks into the Congress, was a report offered by a leader who did not \ncome from the Bolsheviks.84 Delegates moved on to discuss the statutes of the \nCommunist International at session fourteen that evening. Diplomatic \nconsiderations entrusted the report to a non-Russian: there had been \ncriticisms that the Russians were ruling the Congress. The Bulgarian \nChristo Kabakchiev was asked to propose statutes which, by \nempowering the Congress to set up a highly centralised structure for \nthe Communist International, would lend still greater power to the \nBolsheviks.93 \nBy the closing rally on 7 August 1920 the Bolsheviks could look back \non a Congress where no attempt at any basic alteration of their \nimperious proposals had been successful. \nCULT OF A STATESMAN \nUnforced acclaim for Lenin came from the Soviet and foreign delegates \nat the Communist International Congress. Paul Levi, the \ntheoretician of the German Communist Party, had been startled by his \nencounter with the Bolshevik leader at the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. The decision had been taken at the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, but had to be kept secret since so many \nparticipants were 'nationalists and pacifists'. Next day started with the \nsixth session's discussion on the Second Communist International \nCongress. He boasted \nthat the Central Committee had had the Congress on its agenda for the \nprevious three months; and that most problems at the Congress had \nrelated to decisions on which foreign organisations were to be allowed \nto join. A \nseizure of power there by socialists continued to be regarded as crucial \nto the flourishing of the Soviet regime, and Clara Zetkin was invited to \naddress the Party Conference in connection with recent developments. 187 Radek \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndefended himself against a previous charge that, out of sectarianism, he \nhad allied himself with anti-Zetkin German communists not wanting to \ninvite non-communist leftist socialists to the Komintem Congress. 194 Lenin's political report, which had \nopened the Conference, was not even voted upon. But in 1917 they agreed about more than they disagreed \nabout. 204 He had forgiven him his Left Communism in 1918.234 Lenin in turn refused.", "Soviet_War_1917": " 5 The Tar in the Honey \nTHE POLISH-SOVIET WAR \nCivil wars are notoriously messy wars. \nThe 'Russian' Civil War was similarly complex, equally bitter. The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In 1918 the Bolshevik-led \nReds had fought against the armies assembled by the Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in the Volga. Russians fought with Russians. The first great campaign after \nthe October Revolution was the invasion of the Ukraine by Bolshevik-\nled troops in December 1917. There was also much fighting \nbetween the various non-Russian peoples. In December 1919 the Supreme \nAllied Council called for a frontier to be drawn between Russia and \n117 \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPoland (which was to be named the Curzon Line after the British \nForeign Secretary). The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation. No Polish \nor Soviet leader seriously expected that conflict of some kind could \npermanently be avoided. In addition, conflicts had occurred between Polish and \nnon-Bolshevik Ukrainian forces. The Bolsheviks would be \ndisclosing a desire to use their armies to envelop Europe in political \ndisturbances and insurrections. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. The Polish-Soviet war was \nfar from dominating the agenda. 10 \nInside the core of the Bolshevik central leadership there was a sharp \nreversal of the roles played in the Brest-Litovsk dispute. Lenin, who had insisted on avoiding war at that \ntime, had become its most committed advocate. By coincidence Stalin, \ntoo, had moved to a pro-war position alongside Lenin; but even he had \nworries about the invasion. Lenin \nwas furious.' 16 For not even Lenin, despite his unbridled \noptimism, thought that the Red Army with its northern sector under \nTukhachevski could occupy Poland and unaided set up a socialist \nadministration. 17 \nThe pamphlet began with a declaration: 'At the present historical \nmoment, the situation is precisely that the Russian model displays \nsomething - and something extremely essential - to all countries about \ntheir inevitable and not distant future. The harshness of the Romanov \nmonarchy had forced Russian socialist theorists into becoming emigres \nand thus brought them into contact with the rest of the world's latest \nideas, and the years before 1917 saw the Bolsheviks test these out \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintensively in a variety of activities: illegal and legal work; small party \ngroups and mass organisation; parliamentarianism and terrorism.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. A Soviet Germany was his \nprimary foreign objective. Lenin asserted that similar deals had been done \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks before 1917.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. For Bauer \ncontended that Bolshevism, while being suited to the peculiar \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconditions of Russia, ill-befitted the rest of industrial Europe.51 The second session was delayed for \nfour days white Lenin and his Russian colleagues concentrated on the \nPolish war. 54 \nThe Bolshevik leaders manipulated the proceedings with cunning. Capitalism, Lenin maintained, could not be \nleapt o'er. In 1917 \nhe had still been contending that capitalism already existed to a very \nlarge extent in the former Russian empire.83 Such heresy was attacked by the \nBolshevik Grigori Sokolnikov. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. Lenin and \nfriends had breached the walls of global capitalism. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery.1\u00b01 An official photograph was \ntaken of him in January 1918 and reproduced extensively}02 May Day \nwas celebrated in the same year by Demyan Bedny, a Bolshevik \nversifier, with a paean entitled 'To The Leader'.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. And yet the Soviet republic had a predominantly \nagrarian economy, was poorly served by its network of transport and \ncommunication and had been battered by the effects of the Civil War. Lenin was not an ordinary Russian. And his strategical \ndeviousness was reminiscent of Stalin's Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. 126 Stalin, too, warned against the nationalism \nof Polish workers; for him, Lenin exaggerated the ability of the Red \nArmy to detach the Warsaw working class from support for \npatriotism. They assumed \nthat the Bolsheviks were internationalist in ideology but Russians in \nintention. This notion was given credence by the summons of the anti-\nBolshevik General Brusilov, in retirement since 1917, and to all \nRussian officers to rally to the Russian flag in the country's hour of \nneed.' 34 For Lenin this necessitated simply a 'mad \nreinforcement of the attack on Poland'. The Bolsheviks themselves would have to sue for peace. The \nSoviet-Polish war had ended in catastrophe. 140 \n 138 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAt last the lid placed on internal Bolshevik disputes was blown off. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. The advance on Warsaw, which Lenin described unreservedly \nas a 'war of offensive', showed how wrong Pilsudski had been. The Bolsheviks could sue for peace from a \nposition of strength. He maintained, moreover, \nthat the Soviet economy was improving and that the anti-Soviet \nalliance of Poland, France and the Russian Whites was being disrupted \nby conflicting aims. If the Polish government refused Moscow's terms, \nwar would be resumed and would result in a Red victory. He reminded the Conference that the danger \nfrom Wrangel was as great as had been posed by the Polish armed \nforces, and that other fronts still existed in the Soviet republic: in the \nCaucasus, in Turkestan and by Lake Baikal. The Red Army had in fact been routed; but, according to Trotski \nat the Conference, this had been unforeseeable (even though he had, \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonths beforehand, foreseen it). The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. 168 Lenin joined the assault on Stalin. The \nimplication was that Stalin had been ambitious to take command of \nthe entire Red campaign. 'Hands off Russia. This transforma-\ntion on the spur of the moment resulted from a new mood in Moscow, \nbut was no basis for assessing the international situation. Accused of unwarranted \npessimism, he reminded the Conference that it had been leaders such \nas Kamenev and Zinoviev who had opposed the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in October 1917.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin. Schisms among Russian \nMarxists before 1914 led him to cease to show respect for \nPlekhanov, Trotski, Martov, Maslov, Zhordania and Bogdanov. 197 \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe single Bolshevik who figured in his mind as a commensurate \ntheorist was Nikolai Bukharin. But in 1917 they agreed about more than they disagreed \nabout. \nBogdanov and Lenin had fought a political and philosophical battle in \n1908-1909, ending with an organisational schism between their \nrespective supporters in the Bolshevik faction.202 But otherwise he retained his anti-Bogdanovist \nanimus, and Bogdanov's name appears more often than any other in \nthe expletive-laden commentary by Lenin in the margins of Bukharin's \nbook. Lenin himself wrote in the jargon of \ncontemporary Marxism, often with tedious prolixity; but he would \nnever have allowed himself to refer, for example, to wartime economic \ncollapse as 'expanded negative reproduction'207 or to the effects of \nBolshevik policy in 1918-1920 as 'the resurrection of industry in a \nsocialist formu1ation'.22H \nThe necessity for the working class to undergo cultural development \nafter the October Revolution had been asserted by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution in mid-1917.234 Lenin in turn refused.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power.", "Left_Wing_1917": " His detour into the history of his party drove \nhome the message to left-wing elements in the Communist Inter-\nnational's parties that the Russian Communist Party, the only \naffiliated party which had seized and kept power, had achieved its \nends by avoiding ultra-leftist sloganeering. Within \nthe German Communist Party itself there remained a left-wing faction \nhighly critical of the official leadership. The German left-wing communists \naimed at a dictatorship of the proletariat wherein the proletariat held \ndirect power. \nNevertheless The Infantile Disease of 'Leftism' was a milestone in the \ndevelopment of international communism. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.46 This was a greater \nobstacle to communism's advance than left-wing 'infantilism'.47 Giacinto \nSerrati from the Italian Socialist Party congratulated the Red Army on \na campaign that was going welt against the Potes. \nThis attitude was superseded after October 1917.", "Bolshevik_Opponents_1917": " \nThe 'Russian' Civil War was similarly complex, equally bitter. The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In 1918 the Bolshevik-led \nReds had fought against the armies assembled by the Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in the Volga. By the end of the year this conflict had \nbeen superseded by a struggle between the Reds and the anti-socialist \nforces of the Whites. Russians fought with Russians. Nor were the various \ncampaigns exclusively a Russian affair. The first great campaign after \nthe October Revolution was the invasion of the Ukraine by Bolshevik-\nled troops in December 1917. There was also much fighting \nbetween the various non-Russian peoples. In December 1919 the Supreme \nAllied Council called for a frontier to be drawn between Russia and \n117 \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPoland (which was to be named the Curzon Line after the British \nForeign Secretary). The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation. In addition, conflicts had occurred between Polish and \nnon-Bolshevik Ukrainian forces. Bolsheviks \nwere enjoined by him to treat 'the new adventure with utmost \ntranquillity'.4 Other Bolsheviks who had \nadvocated the same treaty were not immune from a subsequent \ncompulsion to prove their revolutionary credentials by advocating \nrisky ultra-leftist putsches. But Lenin had no need to demonstrate the genuineness of his \nradicalism. The Bolsheviks would be \ndisclosing a desire to use their armies to envelop Europe in political \ndisturbances and insurrections. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. This act showed \nthat the Bolsheviks aimed at more than hot pursuit in order to teach \nPilsudski a lesson. The Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee, \nor Polrevkom, proclaimed the removal of the country's existing cabinet \nand issued decrees on land, industry, administration and security in line \nwith Bolshevik policies in Russia since 1917. The Polrevkom shifted its headquarters westwards as the Red \n 120 \nLenin: A Political Life \nArmy advanced. 10 \nInside the core of the Bolshevik central leadership there was a sharp \nreversal of the roles played in the Brest-Litovsk dispute. Lenin, who had insisted on avoiding war at that \ntime, had become its most committed advocate. Lenin was the sole fire-breathing enthusiast. His \nperception of the significance of nationalism was acute in relation \nmainly to the territory of the old Russian empire (whereas the \nBolshevik left tended to have fuzzy vision here). They, moreover, shared the \nassumption that the October Revolution in Russia would expire unless \nfraternal revolutionary states were established elsewhere in Europe; \nthey had also become loath to challenge Lenin's general judgement: by \n1920 it was accepted in the Central Committee that he had been right \nabout the October Revolution and the treaty ofBrest-Litovsk. Lenin \nwas furious. In late July 1920 it \nlooked to Lenin and to many governments in the West that he might \nwell succeed. 17 \nThe pamphlet began with a declaration: 'At the present historical \nmoment, the situation is precisely that the Russian model displays \nsomething - and something extremely essential - to all countries about \ntheir inevitable and not distant future.19 The \nBolsheviks in Lenin's opinion had been placed in an excellent position \nto learn the necessary lessons early. The harshness of the Romanov \nmonarchy had forced Russian socialist theorists into becoming emigres \nand thus brought them into contact with the rest of the world's latest \nideas, and the years before 1917 saw the Bolsheviks test these out \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintensively in a variety of activities: illegal and legal work; small party \ngroups and mass organisation; parliamentarianism and terrorism.2\u00b0 \nLenin's argument was that the Bolshevik tradition had not been leftism \nfor its own sake.21 (This was also a piece of self-\npromotion: Lenin had wanted both to enter the Duma and sign the \npeace.25 \nLenin was scathingly realistic: 'We can (and must) begin to construct \nsocialism not from human material which exists in fairy-tales and is \nspecially created by us but from the legacy bequeathed to us by \ncapitalism.27 Lenin repeated his pre-1914 \nargument that, while parliamentarianism would not produce a \n The Tar in the Honey \n123 \ntransition to socialism, no party should pass up the opportunities \nafforded by Dumas and Reichstags for propaganda. Lenin maintained that it was \nKautsky, Bauer and other opponents of communist parties who held to \nfixed and unalterable strategical schemata.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. Lenin insisted \nthat, as the Bolsheviks had had to accept the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, so \nthe German comrades might even have to acquiesce in the treaty of \nVersailles for a lengthy period. Lenin did not wish to discourage sympathisers. Lenin asserted that similar deals had been done \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks before 1917. A Bolshevik-Menshevik coalition had \nbeen formed in 1906 because most Bolsheviks and Mensheviks desired \nit; they did not come together because a newly-formed Bolshevik \nfaction wanted to become more influential by means of association \nwith a more popular Menshevik faction. It showed how confident \nLenin had become. He was claiming, not too subtly, the \nwisdom of the patriarch; and, whenever he indicated past mistakes \nmade by the Bolshevik party, he adduced the rashness of his own \nBolshevik opponents. He \nalso played on the assumption that no one would have the knowledge \nor presumption to challenge his tendentious exposition of Bolshevik \nparty history.3 \nTHE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERNATIONAL \nDelegates to the Second Communist International Congress congre-\ngated in Moscow in summer 1920 and, in deference to Petrograd's \nstatus as the birthplace of the October Revolution, they took the train \nto the north and assembled in the Smolny Institute on 19 July 1920. In \nparticular, he called upon member parties to accept the organisational \nrules proposed by the Bolshevik party.43 \nLenin erroneously asserted that the British Independent Labour Party \nwas seeking affiliation to the Communist International.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. For Bauer \ncontended that Bolshevism, while being suited to the peculiar \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconditions of Russia, ill-befitted the rest of industrial Europe.51 The second session was delayed for \nfour days white Lenin and his Russian colleagues concentrated on the \nPolish war. 54 \nThe Bolshevik leaders manipulated the proceedings with cunning. He had not forgotten \nhis problems with the Bolshevik party at the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919. Capitalism, Lenin maintained, could not be \nleapt o'er.61 In mid-1920, faced with Communist \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \nInternational comrades from entirely non-industrialised countries, he \nhad had to re-think his strategy. In 1917 \nhe had still been contending that capitalism already existed to a very \nlarge extent in the former Russian empire.63 \nNor did Lenin yet try to link his newly-developed thinking to his \npractice in 1917. The strategy of the Bolshevik leader in the October \nRevolution was replete with inchoateness and contradictions; but, at \nleast in some respects, it was premised on the capacity of a Russia \nwhich was not fully industrialised to move directly, even if gradually, \ntowards a socialist order. For Lenin, it was de rigueur to present himself as the most \northodox Marxist; and he was untroubled by the fact that this \nnecessitated playing fast and loose with the contents of Marx's \ncorrespondence with Russian nineteenth-century agrarian Marxists.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo.72 Crispien stood up to it, castigating Bolshevik attitudes to \nrevolutionary terror and to the peasant question.73 Belatedly, on 30 \nJuly, Lenin joined in. The Bolsheviks had selected him to deliver the report on \nparliamentarianism.80 Not until4 August, in session thirteen and over two \nweeks into the Congress, was a report offered by a leader who did not \ncome from the Bolsheviks.81 \nLenin recounted his experience with the Bolshevik party in 1917, \nwhen he had initially hoped to incorporate the principle of land \nnationalisation and, after criticism, had had to remove this particular \ndemand from his theses.83 Such heresy was attacked by the \nBolshevik Grigori Sokolnikov. The Bulgarian \nChristo Kabakchiev was asked to propose statutes which, by \nempowering the Congress to set up a highly centralised structure for \nthe Communist International, would lend still greater power to the \nBolsheviks. After all that \nLenin had said about Europe's 'social-chauvinists' and his schismatic \nbehaviour in 1917, the British comrades were as much mystified \nas annoyed.93 \nBy the closing rally on 7 August 1920 the Bolsheviks could look back \non a Congress where no attempt at any basic alteration of their \nimperious proposals had been successful. It was a triumph for \nBolshevism and for Lenin in particular. But the general tone was anyway deferential towards \nLenin. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. Lenin and \nfriends had breached the walls of global capitalism. Factory owners \nand bankers were the world's worst sinners whereas the Bolsheviks \ncould be brought to repent their ways. \nCULT OF A STATESMAN \nUnforced acclaim for Lenin came from the Soviet and foreign delegates \nat the Communist International Congress. Lenin, as leader of party and \ngovernment, was the obvious subject. Often Lenin, alongside Trotski, was depicted as a \nJew.96 \nBut the anti-Bolshevik portraitists did not know this; their intention \nhad blatantly been to stir up hostility to the Bolsheviks by playing on \npopular antisemitism. A cult of Lenin was in the making. The Bolsheviks pulled \ndown the memorials to Russian emperors, replacing them with hastily-\ncommissioned busts and statues of protagonists. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery.99 Its rationale \nfor focussing attention on the living Lenin was provided by Mikhail \nOlminski, who had written a biographical piece on him for a Moscow \nBolshevik newspaper in mid-1917 and who in 1918 called for Lenin to \nbe studied as the incarnation of 'the colossal revolutionary proletarian \ncollective' .100 By then the Bolshevik press had been lavishing regular \npraise on the party's chief. A poem in his honour had been published in \nPravda as early as 29 October 1917.1\u00b01 An official photograph was \ntaken of him in January 1918 and reproduced extensively}02 May Day \nwas celebrated in the same year by Demyan Bedny, a Bolshevik \nversifier, with a paean entitled 'To The Leader'. 103 \nThe attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918 was followed by \noutpourings about his preciousness to the party. A sentimentalised \naccount was written by Grigori Zinoviev, who asserted that Lenin had \nundergone penury in Switzerland in service of the revolutionary \ncause. Lenin \nwas said to have been 'crowned with thorns of slander'; and \nL. Sosnovski maintained in a Petrograd newspaper that his survival \nof a Socialist-Revolutionary attack proved that there was something \nbeyond the normal about him: 'Lenin cannot be killed.' 106 \nLenin did not encourage this overtly. Lenin made his \nexcuses and left in the middle of the proceedings. Others had put it more crudely by stating that Lenin had \nbecome a dictator.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. On his return to Russia in 1917 he \nhad been inventive in fashioning his message and his image under the \nscrutiny of public opinion. He did not stop trying to identify himself \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith the working class after the October Revolution. Lenin also went \non wearing his workman's peaked cap, which had been effective in \nwinning popularity at mass meetings in 1917. \nKnowledge about Lenin was perforce restricted. The ubiquitousness of \nthe 'Lenin cult' was therefore a mainly posthumous phenomenon. Lenin was becoming as much 'the little father' to the \npeasantry as Nicholas 11. 117 This phenomenon did not mean that most \npeasants were consciously pro-Bolshevik. 1 18 \nEven the fact that this permission was extracted from Lenin against \nthe resistance of his prejudices was not counted against him. Lenin was not an ordinary Russian. \nLenin did not share the aspirations of ordinary Russians. 121 \nThat Lenin should have impressed this upon Levi was remarkable \nenough: the advocate of'European civil war' in 1914-1917 had become \nthe supporter of a Burgfrieden between the German bourgeoisie and \nworking class. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. 129 But on a rare visit from the front to Moscow, Trotski could \nfind only Rykov to back his own opposition to opening an offensive; \nand Rykov came over to Lenin's side once the invasion had been \nstarted. They assumed \nthat the Bolsheviks were internationalist in ideology but Russians in \nintention. This notion was given credence by the summons of the anti-\nBolshevik General Brusilov, in retirement since 1917, and to all \nRussian officers to rally to the Russian flag in the country's hour of \nneed. 133 \nThroughout the campaign Lenin had thrust the Red Army into an \naggressive posture.' 34 For Lenin this necessitated simply a 'mad \nreinforcement of the attack on Poland'. The Bolsheviks themselves would have to sue for peace. 140 \n 138 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAt last the lid placed on internal Bolshevik disputes was blown off. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. This was the \nmotivation, according to Lenin, for Pilsudski's incursion into the \nUkraine.' Lenin allowed that \ndiplomatic mistakes might have been made. The Bolsheviks could sue for peace from a \nposition of strength. 144 Lenin, by means of Pravda, was seeking \nto deceive foreign embassies into believing that the Red Army could \nand would fight on regardless. His had been the first trip abroad \nby a major Bolshevik figure since before the October Revolution (and \nit is worth noting by comparison that Lenin, an inveterate traveller \nbefore 1917, made no foreign excursion for the rest of his life; indeed he \ntravelled no further than from Moscow to Petrograd on any particular \noccasion). Kamenev warned that the Committee of Action in England \nwas constituted by anti-Bolsheviks. The Red Army had in fact been routed; but, according to Trotski \nat the Conference, this had been unforeseeable (even though he had, \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonths beforehand, foreseen it). Minin, serving as political commissar with the \nFirst Cavalry Army, charged Lenin with evading basic questions. The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. 168 Lenin joined the assault on Stalin. Neither Lenin nor Trotski deigned to respond. The statistical information was accompanied by a \ncomplaint that local party committees seldom appreciated the strains \nof work in Moscow. Perhaps Lenin \nwould not have offended so many fellow Bolsheviks even if he had been \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngiven one of the 'dirty' jobs in the Red Army done by Trotski and \nStalin. Lutovinov and the \nWorkers' Opposition replied that the Democratic Centralists behaved \nno differently from supporters of Lenin in their local party \ncommittees. 177 But Lenin intervened only briefly, \nopining that the Central Committee's attackers were not so much \ndemagogic as simply exhausted. He recalled that, in the \ncorridors of the Congress, he had canvassed non-Soviet participants to \ntake more active steps to support the Bolsheviks. 185 By 1920 she had become an admirer of the Bolshevik \nleader. Snapping away at the heels of Zinoviev and \n- not so discreetly - Lenin, he noted how the caution of the Bolshevik \ncentral party leadership about the possibility of imminent socialist \nrevolution in Europe had changed abruptly into extraordinary \noptimism as the Red Army advanced into Poland. 187 Radek \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndefended himself against a previous charge that, out of sectarianism, he \nhad allied himself with anti-Zetkin German communists not wanting to \ninvite non-communist leftist socialists to the Komintem Congress. \nThis, he stated, was untrue; and he added that Lenin's own The \nInfantile Disease, published shortly before the Congress, had had the \npurpose of pushing away those leftists who were not entirely adherents \nof Bolshevik party policies. If Lenin's idea had been to attract as many \nleftists to Moscow as possible, why attack Anton Pannekoek and \nothers so viciously in print. Accused of unwarranted \npessimism, he reminded the Conference that it had been leaders such \nas Kamenev and Zinoviev who had opposed the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in October 1917. 194 Lenin's political report, which had \nopened the Conference, was not even voted upon. Even more extra-\nordinary was Lenin's absence from the last session.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin. Schisms among Russian \nMarxists before 1914 led him to cease to show respect for \nPlekhanov, Trotski, Martov, Maslov, Zhordania and Bogdanov. It is true that practically all prominent \nBolsheviks, including those of a practical bent like Stalin, had \npretensions as Marxist theorists. Trotski, moreover, had returned to Lenin's side \nand was a political thinker of distinction among Bolsheviks. Never-\ntheless Lenin paid them little heed, reading their books but not \nadjusting his ideas much in reaction. 197 \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe single Bolshevik who figured in his mind as a commensurate \ntheorist was Nikolai Bukharin. But in 1917 they agreed about more than they disagreed \nabout. \nBogdanov and Lenin had fought a political and philosophical battle in \n1908-1909, ending with an organisational schism between their \nrespective supporters in the Bolshevik faction.202 But otherwise he retained his anti-Bogdanovist \nanimus, and Bogdanov's name appears more often than any other in \nthe expletive-laden commentary by Lenin in the margins of Bukharin's \nbook.203 Lenin had forgiven Bukharin his alleged anarchism in the \nGreat War (and indeed had recognised that the allegation was \nunfounded). Lenin adopted an ironical stance: 'Ooot1 Oh. Lenin himself wrote in the jargon of \ncontemporary Marxism, often with tedious prolixity; but he would \nnever have allowed himself to refer, for example, to wartime economic \ncollapse as 'expanded negative reproduction'207 or to the effects of \nBolshevik policy in 1918-1920 as 'the resurrection of industry in a \nsocialist formu1ation'. Lenin tried to sugar the pill. '218 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's recensio academica contained the following headline: 'A \nspoonful of tar in a barrel of honey. These alleviated Lenin's concern lest \nBukharin should go over not only to Bogdanov's philosophy but even \nto his political recommendations; for Bogdanov had always con-\ndemned the violence and illegitimacy of the October Revolution. These aspects were but lightly \ndrawn, but Lenin was alert to them. In the first place, there were \nBukharin's repeated Eositive references to 'sociology': always a term \nspat out by Lenin.225 \nThe introduction written for this new edition mentioned Bogdanov; \nbut Bukharin was an equal, if unnamed, target as Lenin renewed the \n The Tar in the Honey \n149 \nintra-Bolshevik dispute on philosophy.226 Lenin was motivated not \nonly by the intellectual issues but also by their connection with current \npolitical discussions in the party about the working class. But \nthe Bolshevik party's claim to have hundreds of thousands of working-\nclass members was accompanied by the acknowledgement that most of \nthem had no active role in party life.227 This was anathema to Lenin as a \nstrategy of revolutionary change, and he derided Bogdanov's ideas on \n'proletarian culture' as themselves being 'bourgeois and reaction-\nary\u2022.22H \nThe necessity for the working class to undergo cultural development \nafter the October Revolution had been asserted by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution in mid-1917.232 Lenin tried \nto intimidate Bukharin back into line.233 Bukharin \nrefused to play Lenin's game.234 Lenin in turn refused. On 9 October 1920 he wrote to Lenin: 'I \npersonally consider that to \"conquer\" bourgeois culture in its entirety, \nwithout destroying it, is as impossible as \"conquering\" the bourgeois \nstate.' This statement essentially accused Lenin of attitudes to \nrevolution espoused by his deadly enemy Karl Kautsky.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power.238 The disagreement with Lenin impelled \nBukharin into an intense bout of reading (which was beyond Lenin's \ncapacities since he could hardly cope with his governmental and party \nduties in any case).240 A row over \n The Tar in the Honey \nlSI \nBolshevik cultural policy was in the making.", "German_Communist_Party_1917": " The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In December 1919 the Supreme \nAllied Council called for a frontier to be drawn between Russia and \n117 \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPoland (which was to be named the Curzon Line after the British \nForeign Secretary). The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation. Zinoviev, who had an additional stain on \nhis record for having opposed the October Revolution, was to behave \nin this fashion when calling for a German communist seizure of power \nin 1923. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. Deliberations on both the Second \nCongress of the Communist International and several wrangles over \npersonnel preceded the item on the telegram from Lord Curzon. 11 Both had opposed a separate peace \nwith Germany in 1918. Lenin \nwas furious.' 16 For not even Lenin, despite his unbridled \noptimism, thought that the Red Army with its northern sector under \nTukhachevski could occupy Poland and unaided set up a socialist \nadministration. \n'THE INFANTILE DISEASE OF\"LEFTISM\" IN COMMUNISM' \nIn April and May 1920, in advance of the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, Lenin composed a pamphlet of thirty \nthousand words. His detour into the history of his party drove \nhome the message to left-wing elements in the Communist Inter-\nnational's parties that the Russian Communist Party, the only \naffiliated party which had seized and kept power, had achieved its \nends by avoiding ultra-leftist sloganeering.23 \nAmong his targets were the communists of Germany. The recently-\nformed German Communist Party had already lost its left-wingers, \nwho had established the German Workers' Communist Party. Within \nthe German Communist Party itself there remained a left-wing faction \nhighly critical of the official leadership. The German left-wing communists \naimed at a dictatorship of the proletariat wherein the proletariat held \ndirect power.'26 Then he dealt with the contention of the German leftist \nfaction that parliaments were 'an historically and politically redundant' \narena of revolutionary struggle.27 Lenin repeated his pre-1914 \nargument that, while parliamentarianism would not produce a \n The Tar in the Honey \n123 \ntransition to socialism, no party should pass up the opportunities \nafforded by Dumas and Reichstags for propaganda. The ultra-leftism inside and outside the German \nCommunist Party was identified by him with the Kautskyism which \nwas considered a heresy throughout the Communist Jnternational.29 \nThe German Communist Party as a whole- and not just its leftists-\nwas called upon by Lenin to be more flexible. The German \nIndependent Social-Democratic Party, which included Kautsky in its \nleadership, was riven by factionalism, and its left-wing sections had \napproached the German Communist Party for co-operation. The \nGerman Communist Party, in Lenin's opinion, had wrongly rejected \nthese overtures.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. A Soviet Germany was his \nprimary foreign objective. Lenin insisted \nthat, as the Bolsheviks had had to accept the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, so \nthe German comrades might even have to acquiesce in the treaty of \nVersailles for a lengthy period. The test of the German Communist \nParty's seriousness about obtaining power was its capacity to accept \nthe necessity of harsh compromises. \nAn electoral pact would enable the communists to gain a few \nparliamentary seats.37 This dubious prediction ignored the difficulties that a \nCommunist Party of Great Britain would experience in recruiting \nmembers if it forswore a role as rebel against the political status quo. \nNevertheless The Infantile Disease of 'Leftism' was a milestone in the \ndevelopment of international communism. Plainly he wished to subject all Communist International \nparties to firm discipline. News came through that the German Communist Party had \nsplit into two factions and that the communist sympathiser in the \nItalian Socialist Party, Amadeo Bordiga, had come out against putting \nup parliamentary candidates. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd.3 \nTHE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERNATIONAL \nDelegates to the Second Communist International Congress congre-\ngated in Moscow in summer 1920 and, in deference to Petrograd's \nstatus as the birthplace of the October Revolution, they took the train \nto the north and assembled in the Smolny Institute on 19 July 1920.40 His report exhibited \ndelight that the Independent German Social-Democratic Party, the \nFrench Socialist Party and the American Socialist Party had broken \nwith the Second International.43 \nLenin erroneously asserted that the British Independent Labour Party \nwas seeking affiliation to the Communist International.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. The \nCommunist International would be able to bring the sincere but misted \nleftists of central and eastern Germany to their senses.48 Kart Reinhardt, \nspeaking for the Austrian Communist party, expressed revulsion about \nthe barbarous repression of Beta Kun's Soviet republic in Hungary.49 \nBut it was Julian Marchlewski from the Communist Workers' Party of \nPoland that made the Congress look closely at the current military \ncampaign in Poland. 54 \nThe Bolshevik leaders manipulated the proceedings with cunning. He had not forgotten \nhis problems with the Bolshevik party at the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919.61 In mid-1920, faced with Communist \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \nInternational comrades from entirely non-industrialised countries, he \nhad had to re-think his strategy.67 A consensus had arisen \nthat the new communist parties in the colonies should preserve their \nindependence from other anti-imperial political groups. Evidently, if \nthe Communist International wanted such parties, it had to give them a \nrationale beyond helping the indigenous bourgeoisies to power.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo. Officially he \nrepresented the Polish delegation; but he had belonged to the Russian \nSocial-Democratic Labour Party before 1914 and had lived in Moscow \nintermittently since 1918.84 Delegates moved on to discuss the statutes of the \nCommunist International at session fourteen that evening. After all that \nLenin had said about Europe's 'social-chauvinists' and his schismatic \nbehaviour in 1917, the British comrades were as much mystified \nas annoyed. By a vote \n The Tar in the Honey \n131 \nof 58 to 24 the British communists were told to join the Labour Party. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. \nCULT OF A STATESMAN \nUnforced acclaim for Lenin came from the Soviet and foreign delegates \nat the Communist International Congress. Lenin, as leader of party and \ngovernment, was the obvious subject. A cult of Lenin was in the making. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery. 103 \nThe attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918 was followed by \noutpourings about his preciousness to the party.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. Paul Levi, the \ntheoretician of the German Communist Party, had been startled by his \nencounter with the Bolshevik leader at the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International. Levi thought that, if a non-communist \ngovernment in Berlin were to go to war against the Allies, his own \n 136 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty should refrain from involvement. 119 Lenin, however, remon-\nstrated that German communists should even form what he called 'an \nunnatural bloc' with the extreme political right in such a contingency. 120 A German anti-Allies campaign \nwould therefore be a war of national liberation. Once it had been won, \nthe German Communist Party in turn would resume the political \noffensive against the German bourgeoisie. 121 \nThat Lenin should have impressed this upon Levi was remarkable \nenough: the advocate of'European civil war' in 1914-1917 had become \nthe supporter of a Burgfrieden between the German bourgeoisie and \nworking class. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. Lenin was determined to press on to Warsaw and then to \nBerlin. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. A \nseizure of power there by socialists continued to be regarded as crucial \nto the flourishing of the Soviet regime, and Clara Zetkin was invited to \naddress the Party Conference in connection with recent developments. 187 Radek \n 144 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndefended himself against a previous charge that, out of sectarianism, he \nhad allied himself with anti-Zetkin German communists not wanting to \ninvite non-communist leftist socialists to the Komintem Congress.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin.

The \nyear 1917 witnessed not one uniform revolutionary process but a \nmultitude of variegated revolutions, and the ensuing years saw the \noutbreak of many intersecting civil wars. In 1918 the Bolshevik-led \nReds had fought against the armies assembled by the Socialist-\nRevolutionaries in the Volga. By the end of the year this conflict had \nbeen superseded by a struggle between the Reds and the anti-socialist \nforces of the Whites. Russians fought with Russians. Nor were the various \ncampaigns exclusively a Russian affair. The first great campaign after \nthe October Revolution was the invasion of the Ukraine by Bolshevik-\nled troops in December 1917. There was also much fighting \nbetween the various non-Russian peoples. Border disputes raged \namong the Armenians, Azeris and Georgians; and the violence \ninvolved adjacent states. In December 1919 the Supreme \nAllied Council called for a frontier to be drawn between Russia and \n117 \n 118 \nLenin: A Political Life \nPoland (which was to be named the Curzon Line after the British \nForeign Secretary). The Bolshevik commit-\nment to European revolution, too, exacerbated the situation. In addition, conflicts had occurred between Polish and \nnon-Bolshevik Ukrainian forces. Negotiations in the autumn between \nSovnarkom and Paderewski were aborted by mutual mistrust; and the \nPolish military commander Josef Pilsudski held talks with the ousted \nUkrainian nationalist leader Semion Petlyura for a war to be fought to \nestablish a border federation of Poland and Ukraine in opposition to \nthe Soviet republic of Lenin and Trotski.2 \nSuch seizures of power had happened so often in the Ukraine in the \nprevious years that Lenin was not unduly disconcerted. Bolsheviks \nwere enjoined by him to treat 'the new adventure with utmost \ntranquillity'.3 But Lenin's judgement, eccentric \nas it was, revealed what was in his own mind.4 Other Bolsheviks who had \nadvocated the same treaty were not immune from a subsequent \ncompulsion to prove their revolutionary credentials by advocating \nrisky ultra-leftist putsches. But Lenin had no need to demonstrate the genuineness of his \nradicalism. The Bolsheviks would be \ndisclosing a desire to use their armies to envelop Europe in political \ndisturbances and insurrections. 7 The Bolshevik Central \nCommittee assembled for a plenum on 17 July. This act showed \nthat the Bolsheviks aimed at more than hot pursuit in order to teach \nPilsudski a lesson. The Polrevkom shifted its headquarters westwards as the Red \n 120 \nLenin: A Political Life \nArmy advanced. 10 \nInside the core of the Bolshevik central leadership there was a sharp \nreversal of the roles played in the Brest-Litovsk dispute. Lenin, who had insisted on avoiding war at that \ntime, had become its most committed advocate. His \nperception of the significance of nationalism was acute in relation \nmainly to the territory of the old Russian empire (whereas the \nBolshevik left tended to have fuzzy vision here). They, moreover, shared the \nassumption that the October Revolution in Russia would expire unless \nfraternal revolutionary states were established elsewhere in Europe; \nthey had also become loath to challenge Lenin's general judgement: by \n1920 it was accepted in the Central Committee that he had been right \nabout the October Revolution and the treaty ofBrest-Litovsk. Lenin \nwas furious. In late July 1920 it \nlooked to Lenin and to many governments in the West that he might \nwell succeed. \n'THE INFANTILE DISEASE OF\"LEFTISM\" IN COMMUNISM' \nIn April and May 1920, in advance of the Second Congress of the \nCommunist International, Lenin composed a pamphlet of thirty \nthousand words. 17 \nThe pamphlet began with a declaration: 'At the present historical \nmoment, the situation is precisely that the Russian model displays \nsomething - and something extremely essential - to all countries about \ntheir inevitable and not distant future.19 The \nBolsheviks in Lenin's opinion had been placed in an excellent position \nto learn the necessary lessons early. The harshness of the Romanov \nmonarchy had forced Russian socialist theorists into becoming emigres \nand thus brought them into contact with the rest of the world's latest \nideas, and the years before 1917 saw the Bolsheviks test these out \n 122 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintensively in a variety of activities: illegal and legal work; small party \ngroups and mass organisation; parliamentarianism and terrorism.2\u00b0 \nLenin's argument was that the Bolshevik tradition had not been leftism \nfor its own sake. There was some truth in this; but it neglected Lenin's \nperiods of recklessness and intransigence. Lenin wanted to describe the less rumbustious \nepisodes of the past.25 \nLenin was scathingly realistic: 'We can (and must) begin to construct \nsocialism not from human material which exists in fairy-tales and is \nspecially created by us but from the legacy bequeathed to us by \ncapitalism.27 Lenin repeated his pre-1914 \nargument that, while parliamentarianism would not produce a \n The Tar in the Honey \n123 \ntransition to socialism, no party should pass up the opportunities \nafforded by Dumas and Reichstags for propaganda. Lenin maintained that it was \nKautsky, Bauer and other opponents of communist parties who held to \nfixed and unalterable strategical schemata.31 But Lenin's distortion of the history of 1917, with \nwhich the non-Russian parties of the Communist International were ill-\nacquainted, served current political ends. Lenin insisted \nthat, as the Bolsheviks had had to accept the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, so \nthe German comrades might even have to acquiesce in the treaty of \nVersailles for a lengthy period. Lenin did not wish to discourage sympathisers. Lenin asserted that similar deals had been done \nbetween Bolsheviks and Mensheviks before 1917. A Bolshevik-Menshevik coalition had \nbeen formed in 1906 because most Bolsheviks and Mensheviks desired \nit; they did not come together because a newly-formed Bolshevik \nfaction wanted to become more influential by means of association \nwith a more popular Menshevik faction. He was claiming, not too subtly, the \nwisdom of the patriarch; and, whenever he indicated past mistakes \nmade by the Bolshevik party, he adduced the rashness of his own \nBolshevik opponents. He \nalso played on the assumption that no one would have the knowledge \nor presumption to challenge his tendentious exposition of Bolshevik \nparty history. Ultra-leftism, wrote the \nquintessential ultra-leftist of 1917, had to be disowned bl the Second \nCongress of the Communist International in Petrograd. In \nparticular, he called upon member parties to accept the organisational \nrules proposed by the Bolshevik party.44 In addition, \nLenin expatiated on German developments. For Bauer \ncontended that Bolshevism, while being suited to the peculiar \n 126 \nLenin: A Political Life \nconditions of Russia, ill-befitted the rest of industrial Europe.51 The second session was delayed for \nfour days white Lenin and his Russian colleagues concentrated on the \nPolish war. 54 \nThe Bolshevik leaders manipulated the proceedings with cunning. 55 Nor did it \nharm Lenin's interests at the Congress that the entire third session, \nwhich followed on 24 July, was given up to disputes among the foreign \nparties. He had not forgotten \nhis problems with the Bolshevik party at the Eighth Party Congress in \nMarch 1919. Capitalism, Lenin maintained, could not be \nleapt o'er.61 In mid-1920, faced with Communist \n 128 \nLenin: A Political Life \nInternational comrades from entirely non-industrialised countries, he \nhad had to re-think his strategy. In 1917 \nhe had still been contending that capitalism already existed to a very \nlarge extent in the former Russian empire.63 \nNor did Lenin yet try to link his newly-developed thinking to his \npractice in 1917. The strategy of the Bolshevik leader in the October \nRevolution was replete with inchoateness and contradictions; but, at \nleast in some respects, it was premised on the capacity of a Russia \nwhich was not fully industrialised to move directly, even if gradually, \ntowards a socialist order. For Lenin, it was de rigueur to present himself as the most \northodox Marxist; and he was untroubled by the fact that this \nnecessitated playing fast and loose with the contents of Marx's \ncorrespondence with Russian nineteenth-century agrarian Marxists.71 \nForeign parties at the Congress were subjected to pressure by \nBolsheviks in sessions seven and eight; but the German Independents \nCrispien and Dittmann were singled out for such treatment by others \ntoo.72 Crispien stood up to it, castigating Bolshevik attitudes to \nrevolutionary terror and to the peasant question. He also \ncomplained about his delay in breaking with Kautsky: almost a capital \noffence in Lenin's eyes. The Bolsheviks had selected him to deliver the report on \nparliamentarianism. It was an ironic choice in the light of Bukharin's \nreputation for hostility to the use of parliaments by Europe's socialists \nin the Great War;76 and Lenin relished hearing him declare that \ncommunists had to use parliaments as instruments of political struggle.80 Not until4 August, in session thirteen and over two \nweeks into the Congress, was a report offered by a leader who did not \ncome from the Bolsheviks.81 \nLenin recounted his experience with the Bolshevik party in 1917, \nwhen he had initially hoped to incorporate the principle of land \nnationalisation and, after criticism, had had to remove this particular \ndemand from his theses.83 Such heresy was attacked by the \nBolshevik Grigori Sokolnikov. Diplomatic \nconsiderations entrusted the report to a non-Russian: there had been \ncriticisms that the Russians were ruling the Congress. The Bulgarian \nChristo Kabakchiev was asked to propose statutes which, by \nempowering the Congress to set up a highly centralised structure for \nthe Communist International, would lend still greater power to the \nBolsheviks. After all that \nLenin had said about Europe's 'social-chauvinists' and his schismatic \nbehaviour in 1917, the British comrades were as much mystified \nas annoyed.93 \nBy the closing rally on 7 August 1920 the Bolsheviks could look back \non a Congress where no attempt at any basic alteration of their \nimperious proposals had been successful. It was a triumph for \nBolshevism and for Lenin in particular. But the general tone was anyway deferential towards \nLenin. The Bolsheviks had taken power; they had won their Civil War; \nthey were bursting through to Poland and, with luck, would soon be in \nBerlin. Lenin and \nfriends had breached the walls of global capitalism. Factory owners \nand bankers were the world's worst sinners whereas the Bolsheviks \ncould be brought to repent their ways. Lenin, as leader of party and \ngovernment, was the obvious subject.96 \nBut the anti-Bolshevik portraitists did not know this; their intention \nhad blatantly been to stir up hostility to the Bolsheviks by playing on \npopular antisemitism. A cult of Lenin was in the making. \nThis attitude was superseded after October 1917. The Bolsheviks pulled \ndown the memorials to Russian emperors, replacing them with hastily-\ncommissioned busts and statues of protagonists. The Bolshevik \nrevolutionary hero belonged to the party's imagery.99 Its rationale \nfor focussing attention on the living Lenin was provided by Mikhail \nOlminski, who had written a biographical piece on him for a Moscow \nBolshevik newspaper in mid-1917 and who in 1918 called for Lenin to \nbe studied as the incarnation of 'the colossal revolutionary proletarian \ncollective' .100 By then the Bolshevik press had been lavishing regular \npraise on the party's chief.1\u00b01 An official photograph was \ntaken of him in January 1918 and reproduced extensively}02 May Day \nwas celebrated in the same year by Demyan Bedny, a Bolshevik \nversifier, with a paean entitled 'To The Leader'. 103 \nThe attempt on Lenin's life in August 1918 was followed by \noutpourings about his preciousness to the party. A sentimentalised \naccount was written by Grigori Zinoviev, who asserted that Lenin had \nundergone penury in Switzerland in service of the revolutionary \ncause. Lenin \nwas said to have been 'crowned with thorns of slander'; and \nL.' 106 \nLenin did not encourage this overtly. Lenin made his \nexcuses and left in the middle of the proceedings. Others had put it more crudely by stating that Lenin had \nbecome a dictator.' 110 \nYet the Bolshevik party leader and Sovnarkom chairman did protest \ntoo much. On his return to Russia in 1917 he \nhad been inventive in fashioning his message and his image under the \nscrutiny of public opinion. He did not stop trying to identify himself \n 134 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwith the working class after the October Revolution. \nKnowledge about Lenin was perforce restricted. The ubiquitousness of \nthe 'Lenin cult' was therefore a mainly posthumous phenomenon. 117 This phenomenon did not mean that most \npeasants were consciously pro-Bolshevik. \nIn reality Lenin was crucially responsible for several policies which \naggrieved the peasantry. Lenin was not an ordinary Russian. \nLenin did not share the aspirations of ordinary Russians. According \nto Lenin, Kapp and his associates differed from Russian counter-\nrevolutionaries in the crucial respect that they were determined to \noverthrow the treaty of Versailles. 121 \nThat Lenin should have impressed this upon Levi was remarkable \nenough: the advocate of'European civil war' in 1914-1917 had become \nthe supporter of a Burgfrieden between the German bourgeoisie and \nworking class. Nor was Lenin \noblivious of the difficulties. For \nLenin was willing to do a deal with the kind of militarists who would \nbecome Nazis by the end of the decade. 129 But on a rare visit from the front to Moscow, Trotski could \nfind only Rykov to back his own opposition to opening an offensive; \nand Rykov came over to Lenin's side once the invasion had been \nstarted. They assumed \nthat the Bolsheviks were internationalist in ideology but Russians in \nintention. This notion was given credence by the summons of the anti-\nBolshevik General Brusilov, in retirement since 1917, and to all \nRussian officers to rally to the Russian flag in the country's hour of \nneed.' 34 For Lenin this necessitated simply a 'mad \nreinforcement of the attack on Poland'. The Bolsheviks themselves would have to sue for peace. The \nSoviet-Polish war had ended in catastrophe. 140 \n 138 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAt last the lid placed on internal Bolshevik disputes was blown off. \nUnusually the right of making the first report was given to a non-\nmember of the Bolshevik party: the obscure Polish communist \nWladislaw Ulanowski. This was the \nmotivation, according to Lenin, for Pilsudski's incursion into the \nUkraine. The advance on Warsaw, which Lenin described unreservedly \nas a 'war of offensive', showed how wrong Pilsudski had been. Small \nstates like Estonia and Georgia, despite what was called by Lenin their \nbourgeois orientation, had made peace with Moscow.' Lenin allowed that \ndiplomatic mistakes might have been made. The Bolsheviks could sue for peace from a \nposition of strength. He maintained, moreover, \nthat the Soviet economy was improving and that the anti-Soviet \nalliance of Poland, France and the Russian Whites was being disrupted \nby conflicting aims. 144 Lenin, by means of Pravda, was seeking \nto deceive foreign embassies into believing that the Red Army could \nand would fight on regardless. His had been the first trip abroad \nby a major Bolshevik figure since before the October Revolution (and \nit is worth noting by comparison that Lenin, an inveterate traveller \nbefore 1917, made no foreign excursion for the rest of his life; indeed he \ntravelled no further than from Moscow to Petrograd on any particular \noccasion). Kamenev warned that the Committee of Action in England \nwas constituted by anti-Bolsheviks. 148 He was pouring cold water on \nthe interpretation of the situation abroad given earlier by Lenin. The Red Army had in fact been routed; but, according to Trotski \nat the Conference, this had been unforeseeable (even though he had, \n 140 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmonths beforehand, foreseen it). Minin, serving as political commissar with the \nFirst Cavalry Army, charged Lenin with evading basic questions. The revolutionary administration of \nRussia was right to attempt to stimulate the outbreak of European \nsocialist revolution. 168 Lenin joined the assault on Stalin. Neither Lenin nor Trotski deigned to respond. The statistical information was accompanied by a \ncomplaint that local party committees seldom appreciated the strains \nof work in Moscow. Lenin, escaping much censure in the debate on \nthe Polish campaign, continued to evade blame in discussions of \nKrestinski's report. Perhaps Lenin \nwould not have offended so many fellow Bolsheviks even if he had been \n 142 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngiven one of the 'dirty' jobs in the Red Army done by Trotski and \nStalin. 177 But Lenin intervened only briefly, \nopining that the Central Committee's attackers were not so much \ndemagogic as simply exhausted. Lenin had very nearly \ndestroyed the effectiveness of Zinoviev's duplicity. He recalled that, in the \ncorridors of the Congress, he had canvassed non-Soviet participants to \ntake more active steps to support the Bolsheviks. 185 By 1920 she had become an admirer of the Bolshevik \nleader. \nThis, he stated, was untrue; and he added that Lenin's own The \nInfantile Disease, published shortly before the Congress, had had the \npurpose of pushing away those leftists who were not entirely adherents \nof Bolshevik party policies. \nBukharin tried to rehearse the arguments already put by Zinoviev while \nLenin kept silent. Accused of unwarranted \npessimism, he reminded the Conference that it had been leaders such \nas Kamenev and Zinoviev who had opposed the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in October 1917. 194 Lenin's political report, which had \nopened the Conference, was not even voted upon. Even more extra-\nordinary was Lenin's absence from the last session.' 195 But \nwhere was Lenin. Schisms among Russian \nMarxists before 1914 led him to cease to show respect for \nPlekhanov, Trotski, Martov, Maslov, Zhordania and Bogdanov. It is true that practically all prominent \nBolsheviks, including those of a practical bent like Stalin, had \npretensions as Marxist theorists. Trotski, moreover, had returned to Lenin's side \nand was a political thinker of distinction among Bolsheviks. 197 \n 146 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe single Bolshevik who figured in his mind as a commensurate \ntheorist was Nikolai Bukharin. Lenin had followed his career in the \nGreat War with almost fatherly care. But in 1917 they agreed about more than they disagreed \nabout. \nBogdanov and Lenin had fought a political and philosophical battle in \n1908-1909, ending with an organisational schism between their \nrespective supporters in the Bolshevik faction. Lenin had several \ncardinal objections to him.202 But otherwise he retained his anti-Bogdanovist \nanimus, and Bogdanov's name appears more often than any other in \nthe expletive-laden commentary by Lenin in the margins of Bukharin's \nbook.203 Lenin had forgiven Bukharin his alleged anarchism in the \nGreat War (and indeed had recognised that the allegation was \nunfounded). Lenin adopted an ironical stance: 'Ooot1 Oh. Lenin himself wrote in the jargon of \ncontemporary Marxism, often with tedious prolixity; but he would \nnever have allowed himself to refer, for example, to wartime economic \ncollapse as 'expanded negative reproduction'207 or to the effects of \nBolshevik policy in 1918-1920 as 'the resurrection of industry in a \nsocialist formu1ation'. Bukharin had \nbetrayed the faith, and Lenin offered summary judgement. His position on the far bank from Lenin was indicated in a \n'scholasticism of terms contradicting dia[lectica1] mat[eralism] (i. \nMarxism)'. '218 \n 148 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLenin's recensio academica contained the following headline: 'A \nspoonful of tar in a barrel of honey. However lightly \nLenin tried to let Bukharin down and however enthusiastically he \naffirmed that the book contained only a 'small inadequacy' (and \nneeded only twenty to thirty pages excised),220 the fundamental \ncriticism was not withdrawn. These alleviated Lenin's concern lest \nBukharin should go over not only to Bogdanov's philosophy but even \nto his political recommendations; for Bogdanov had always con-\ndemned the violence and illegitimacy of the October Revolution. These aspects were but lightly \ndrawn, but Lenin was alert to them. In the first place, there were \nBukharin's repeated Eositive references to 'sociology': always a term \nspat out by Lenin.2 2 Unlike Bukharin, Lenin regarded twentieth-\ncentury sociologists as bourgeois apologists who harmed the socialist \ncause. Lenin was \nundaunted: in September 1920 he determined to re-enter the \nphilosophical fray by sanctioning a second edition of his 1909 \nphilosophical philippic Materialism and Empiriocriticism.225 \nThe introduction written for this new edition mentioned Bogdanov; \nbut Bukharin was an equal, if unnamed, target as Lenin renewed the \n The Tar in the Honey \n149 \nintra-Bolshevik dispute on philosophy.226 Lenin was motivated not \nonly by the intellectual issues but also by their connection with current \npolitical discussions in the party about the working class. But \nthe Bolshevik party's claim to have hundreds of thousands of working-\nclass members was accompanied by the acknowledgement that most of \nthem had no active role in party life.227 This was anathema to Lenin as a \nstrategy of revolutionary change, and he derided Bogdanov's ideas on \n'proletarian culture' as themselves being 'bourgeois and reaction-\nary\u2022.22H \nThe necessity for the working class to undergo cultural development \nafter the October Revolution had been asserted by Lenin in The State \nand Revolution in mid-1917.232 Lenin tried \nto intimidate Bukharin back into line. He also suggested that, instead of \n 150 \nLenin: A Political Life \nraking up a controversy with Bogdanov that was a decade old, Lenin \nshould do everyone the favour of reading what Bogdanov had written \nmore recently .234 Lenin in turn refused. The cultural objectives of the \nmoment, it seemed to Lenin, ought to be less ambitious: literacy, \naccount-keeping and administrative capacity. On 9 October 1920 he wrote to Lenin: 'I \npersonally consider that to \"conquer\" bourgeois culture in its entirety, \nwithout destroying it, is as impossible as \"conquering\" the bourgeois \nstate.236 Lenin, \nkeeping unusually calm at such sniping, retorted algebraically: \n'(I) Proletarian culture= communism; (2) it is carried out by the \nRCP [Russian Communist Party: RS]; (3) class-proletarian [power.238 The disagreement with Lenin impelled \nBukharin into an intense bout of reading (which was beyond Lenin's \ncapacities since he could hardly cope with his governmental and party \nduties in any case). Like Lenin in the epistemological controversy of \n1908-1909, Bukharin wanted material to confound his adversary.240 A row over \n The Tar in the Honey \nlSI \nBolshevik cultural policy was in the making.

Even among Bolsheviks there \nwere inhibitions about the desirable scope of the state's pretensions. \nThe October Revolution was meant, in Lenin's words, to introduce a \ndictatorship of the proletariat. The fact that the party had used \nviolence against the working class had not eradicated a feeling among \nBolsheviks that the interests of the workers should be protected. Leading Bolshevik \ntrade unionists, such as Central Committee member Mikhail Tomski, \nwere comfortable with the notion of a one-party and one-ideology \nstate. Trotski, People's \nCommissar of Military Affairs, requested the militarisation of Soviet \npublic life. Lenin despaired of his Politburo and Red Army colleague. There \nhad been assaults on Lenin's management of both the Polish campaign \nand the party's internal affairs, and a resolution had been passed on the \nneed to reform party organisation. The \npeasants of Russia and the Ukraine were taking up arms against the \nSoviet authorities. In Lenin's estimation, these were the issues requiring urgent \nattention. For a start, Trotski was resting his case on practicality as well \n 154 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas theory.3 \nLenin, however, had luck inasmuch as his policy neither necessitated \nan unsettling change in the measures of the day nor confronted \nparticularly fearsome adversaries; for the Democratic Centralists and \nWorkers' Opposition did not much trouble him. Lenin, as he had shown in controversy after controversy before the \nGreat War and would show again in the foreign-trade discussion of \n1922, was even more likely to act in such a fashion. His abrasiveness \ntowards the Democratic Centralists and Workers' Opposition did not \ncease, and he remained unapologetic about the political departments \nwhich had been castigated at the Ninth Party Conference by many \nlocal committee men who otherwise supported the Lenin-Trotski \nleadership. Lenin would tolerate him no \nmore. Tomski returned from the Conference of Trade Unions, where \nhe had officially represented the Bolshevik Central Committee, and \n Less Politics. \nPressing their case, Lenin and his group proposed counter-theses which \nwere accepted by ten votes to four. 11 But Zinoviev was \nnot a reconciler and Tomski had had a blazing polemic with Trotski at \nthe Congress of Trade Unions; 12 Rykov had been the butt ofTrotski's \nsarcasm at the Ninth Party Congress; 13 Artem had previously hugged \nclose to Lenin. These were \non the 'left' of the Bolshevik political spectrum: Bukharin, Dzierzynski, \nKrestinski, Radek and Serebryakov. Lenin was forced to back off. 16 \nThe commission's composition was balanced equally between Lenin \nand Trotski. Lenin was represented by Rudzutak, Trotski by himself. 19 Like all the \nBolshevik leaders, he had a genuine ideological commitment. \n 156 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTrotski refused to participate in the charade. \nThis time he was more aggressive than Lenin. Lenin had gained a new ally in the person of Zinoviev.22 But the stand-off between Lenin and \nTrotski meant that his reduced group held the balance of power in the \nCentral Committee; and, although not all of the group's members liked \nhis specific slogan, it was sufficiently vague to allow them to force it \nthrough as Central Committee policy. Lenin was as \nannoyed with Bukharin in 1920 as with Trotski two years previously. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. \nLenin remained extraordinarily complacent. It was \nKalinin, not Lenin, who insisted on 14 September that the Politburo \nshould establish a commission of enquiry into the conditions of the \npeasantry.27 Lenin stuck to the grain requisitioning, to the labour \narmies, to a virtual state monopoly in industry; he also reiterated his \ncommitment to attracting concessionnaires into the Russian economy.28 \nVisiting peasants, however, did not let Lenin forget them. By pitching the workers against the peasants, Lenin was setting \nup a situation like the fight between the goat and the ram, in which the \nlynx, whom Belyaev likened to world capitalism, could be the \nbeneficiary.30 Lenin's defence of official policy was not quite as \ndogged as usual. 31 Lenin hoped to indicate that the Politburo was mindful of the \npeasantry's distress. \nLenin rejoiced. \nThis gave Lenin the chance to re-think War Communism.38 In the Civil War the Bolsheviks had exacted taxes, \ngrain and conscripts from village communes as a whole. Compensation on an individual basis was thought to \nsmack of indulgence to the kulak; and, even though the committees of \nthe village poor were disbanded in Russia in December 1918, class \nstruggle in the countryside remained the state's conscious objective. Let \nus be clear about Lenin's new thinking.39 Opinions were divided, and Lenin and Preobrazhenski were \ninstructed on 20 December to draft a resolution on the agrarian \nquestion presentable to the Eighth Congress of Soviets.40 \nOn the same day Lenin gave a report to the Bolshevik fraction on \nforeign concessionnaires.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. Not only the Workers' \nOpposition but many other Bolshevik speakers saw concessions as a \nbetrayal of the Revolution, the proletariat, Marx and communism.44 \nLenin had greatly misjudged the adaptiveness of his party. Having been \nlate in perceiving the dire condition of the economy, he had failed to \nprepare the minds of his fellow party activists before the Congress of \nSoviets. Lenin trimmed his report on behalf of \n 160 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSovnarkom of those aspects which had been most contentious. Disagreements in the \nCentral Committee about the trade unions were being aired at the \nCongress of Soviets; and Bolshevik delegates had to be carefully \ncourted if the Congress was not to turn into a fiasco. Strife returned to the Bolsheviks \nwith a vengeance. In vain did Lenin propose that 'the best politics \nhenceforward will be less politics'.45 \nWhat saved him from humiliation was the unreadiness of Bolsheviks \nto undo him in front of the small number of Mensheviks, Socialist \nRevolutionaries and Left SRs at the Congress. The Bolshevik party's \nmonopoly was not yet total, not quite. Solidarity of some basic kind \nwith the party leader was essential. Furthermore, it did Lenin no harm \nthat these other socialist parties were asking for a reform of economic \npolicy more basic than Lenin's proposal.46 \nLenin dissociated himself from such an abandonment of War \nCommunism. He railed against peasants who became involved in what \nthe Bolsheviks called speculation.47 \nBut Lenin was still not out of the woods. Polemics on the agrarian \nquestion were almost inevitable even when Bolshevik delegates to the \nCongress were on their best behaviour. On 24 December, Lenin \nrepeated to a Bolshevik fraction meeting that a turn towards 'the \npeasant individual economy' was required.49 Even \nLenin, however, was taken aback at the vituperative discussion which \nensued. Despite his best efforts, the Bolshevik fraction at the Congress \nrejected the Lenin-Preobrazhenski proposals on the grounds that they \nfavoured only the kulak. Lenin was angry. \nThe Central Committee met in the emergency on 27 December, and \nLenin described in graphic detail how truculent the Bolshevik delegates \n Less Politics. \nLenin was empowered to go back to the fraction to re-assert the policy \nof the Central Committee.51 Lenin was \njaunty.55 In the Politburo, unbeknownst to \nthe rest of the party, there persisted the dispute about concessions. The acrimony \nwas such that the Politburo opted, by five votes against four, to \nprohibit an open 'party discussion'. Her \ncorpse was conveyed by train to Moscow's Kazan Station at three \no'clock in the morning of II October 1920. Lenin was present and \n 162 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfollowed the coffin through the cold, snow-laden streets.' 58 Lenin and Inessa probably had a sexual liaison \nof some kind before the Great War, and the emotional tie persisted.62 Whether Lenin reciprocated her attitude to him is not \nknown for certain. \n163 \ndiscussion', commenced on 30 December under the gaze of the \nBolshevik party fraction at the Congress of Soviets. Lenin and \nZinoviev stood together against Trotski. Lenin \nconcentrated his fire on Trotski.' Lenin declared that the working class still needed unions to \nprotect its interests. 67 \nLenin emphasised, in an off-the-cuff remark, that the Soviet state \nwas 'not a workers' but a workers' -and-peasants'' state. Bukharin obviously thought that he \ndetected a theoretical gaff, and made an interjection to Lenin's speech: \na rare occurrence by 1920. Before the October Revolution, Lenin had called for the \ninception of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest \npeasantry'. But Lenin disdained to enter \ndebate on the topic. \u00b7n \nLenin had come upon a formula that would see off his adversaries: it \nconveyed pride in the results of the October Revolution while \n 164 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindicating that the workers had a continuing need of protection by \ntrade unions. Despite having most Central \nCommittee members on his side, Lenin could not manipulate the \nadministrative levers of a Secretariat staffed by Trotski's sympathisers: \nKrestinski, Serebryakov and Preobrazhenski.76 The underlying explanation is that \nLenin stood for party unity and was able to portray Trotski as a \nsplitter. Trotski reacted \nby claiming that Lenin's indulgence to the unions was a rhetorical ploy. \nTo a large extent Trotski was right (even though it is equally true that \nLenin was hostile to the extreme anti-unionism of Trotski). And yet \nBolsheviks in the localities faced conditions which could no longer be \nhandled exclusively by command and violence. Yuri Milonov, the \nSamara provincial party leader was unwitting to call for the \nabrogation of the party's dominance over the soviets and trade \nunions; and E. lgnatov, a Bolshevik official in Moscow, wished to \nsupply the soviets with the right to veto appointments in the trade \nunions. Both baulked at the request of Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra \nKollontai for an equitable division of powers among party, soviets and \ntrade unions. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd. 78 Lenin castigated \nShlyapnikov as an anti-party syndicalist and his ideas as a 'syndicalist \ndeviation' from Bolshevism.79 Lenin ignored the evidence. Shlyapnikov \ndid not want to abolish the Bolshevik party; his platform was not \ndesigned to entrust the working class with untrammeled power. He was \nnot a syndicalist, and Lenin knew it. Yet Lenin, having been patient \nwith his party critics until the Eighth Congress of Soviets in December, \nhad his blood up.80 \nLenin introduced a philosophical dimension to the discussion: \nalways a sign of his irritation. Comical \nas this is as a response to Bukharin's perfectly ordinary and innocent \nturn of speech, it was written in earnest: 'In parenthesis it is \nappropriate to note for the benefit of young party members,' asserted \nLenin, 'that it is impossible to become a conscious, real communist \n 166 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwithout studying -\nand truly studying -\neverything written by \nPlekhanov on philosophy since this is the best of the entire \ninternational literature of Marxism. A \nPolitburo decision was taken on 28 January 1921 enjoining Trotski and \nZinoviev, who were on an investigatory mission for the Council of \nLabour and Defence in the Urals, to relegate questions about the trade \nunions to the background. Resentment of Bolshevik political and \neconomic policies within a garrison that had supplied the shock troops \nfor the party in 1917 was reaching boiling point. The peasantry hated the \ncontinuation of the forcible requisitioning of food, the imposition of \nlabour duties and the military conscription of their young men; and \ntheir discontent was clearly focussed on the Bolshevik party and its \ncommissars.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A.

They were determined to \nsecure justice for their cause, and offered a still greater threat to Lenin \nand his associates in 1921 than they had to Kerenski in 1917.89 \nThe Politburo met again on 2 February 1921.92 \nAt first sight it was a bit rich of Lenin to harass Tsyurupa. It is also clear that the striking workers and \nmutineering sailors did not yet unduly bother Lenin and his associates. \nEqually interesting is the lack of Lenin's prominence in the debate.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.97 Since the October Revolution the tendency of \nBolshevik policy had been in the direction of reinforced state \nregulation of the economy. \nBut Lenin had been shaken into re-thinking his own attitudes more \nand more deeply. He had taken detailed notes on grievances expressed \nat a special meeting of non-Bolshevik peasant delegates at the Eighth \nCongress of Soviets on 22 December 1920.98 In addition, he visited \ncertain villages in Moscow province: Yaropolets on 14 November 1920 \nand Modenovo on 15 December 1920. \nPeasants also streamed into the capital seeking an audience with the \nSoviet leader throughout the winter of 1920-1921. Their memoirs were to be written within a political \nenvironment that brooked no criticism of the Bolshevik party and \nSoviet government; and, in any case, the nature of his office was bound \nto deter people from speaking frankly even to a man of Lenin's \nrenowned approachability. 102 The first Bolshevik \nofficial to do so in Lenin's presence was V. 103 \nDid Sokolov finally change Lenin's mind. \nAt a conference of metal-workers on 4 February 1921 Lenin merely \nhinted at the direction of his thought. Four full members were present: Lenin, \nKamenev, Stalin and Krestinski. 107 It was at \nthis meeting that Lenin, having listened to a report by Deputy People's \nCommissar for Agriculture N. Lenin's jottings \nwere the basis of what became known as the New Economic Policy. \nLenin's draft was scribbled out on a single sheet of paper and handed \nto a working party consisting of Kamenev, Tsyurupa and Osinski. 110 No \nPolitburo resolution was recorded on the proposed change of policy; \nand Lenin, in contrast with his behaviour in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, held back from joining this crucial working party. The intra-party discussions in early 1918 had nearly \nbroken up the party. Already the Bolsheviks were at sixes and sevens \nabout the trade unions; and, at a moment of peasant revolts, Lenin had \nto handle his collapsible party with extreme care. \nPolitburo meetings throughout February decided the personnel and \n 170 \nLenin: A Political Life \npractical measures needed to crush the resistance to Bolshevik party \npower. 113 \nOn 16 February 1921 the Politburo decided to sanction a press \ndebate on the pros and cons of a tax in kind. A cautious approach was \nmaintained: the participants would be lesser Bolsheviks and not the \nparty's leaders. Several amend-\nments had been made to Lenin's sketch. 119 Neither \nLenin nor anyone else in the Politburo looked on the reform with \nenthusiasm, and no one wanted to incur unpopularity for pushing it \nthrough without the consent of most party leaders. 123 \nNevertheless Lenin might not have reconciled the Party Congress to \nthe tax in kind if popular rebellions had not intensified. It was by no \nmeans universally accepted in the party that a lowered level of state-\nprocured grain would alleviate urban food-supply difficulties; and the \nvehemence of the Bolshevik fraction's reaction to the much milder \nproposal for agrarian reform made by Lenin and Preobrazhenski at the \nEighth Congress of Soviets lingered in the Politburo's memory. Strikes and food \nshortages shook the minds of all Bolsheviks in Moscow. Strikes broke out \nin Petrograd, and an anti-Bolshevik leaflet campaign had been \norganised. Arrests of active \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, including those who were \nfactory labourers, were demanded. The original advocates \nof the tax were denounced by some Bolshevik activists as being \n 172 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSocialist Revolutionaries (as indeed Sokolov had once been);128 and \nthe tax was said to involve a re-installation of 'bourgeois relations' in \nthe economy (as in fact it did). 129 From Bolshevik leaders in the \nUkraine, including the entire Ukrainian Central Committee, there had \ncome a protest that a tax in kind would impede the People's \nCommissariat of Food Supplies from extricating any grain whatsoever \nfrom the peasants at a time of an anti-Bolshevik peasant revolt across \nthe southern provinces.130 \nBut Lenin held firm.131 Nor did he fait to \nemphasise that the contents of the Ukrainian Bolshevik protest had \nacknowledged that the local working-class population already \ndemanded such a reform so that they could barter with the \npeasantry. 132 The Central Committee in Moscow fell into line with \nthe Politburo's recommendations. This time Lenin took charge, becoming commission \nchairman. \nLENIN'S COHORT \nThe party remained in a condition of shock at the divergence between \nLenin and Trotski over the trade unions. \n173 \nthe country who grew up thinking that the October Revolution had \nbeen led by an individual called 'Lenintrotski' .135 In 1918, during the \nBrest-Litovsk disrute, Lenin and Trotski had avoided trenchant \nmutual criticisms. \nLenin and Trotski knew that such a menace was not as acute as it \nappeared. Trotski had been asked by Lenin in the October Revolution \nto become People's Commissar for Internal Affairs. To be sure, he may have been exaggerating concern \n 174 \nLenin: A Political Life \nabout his ethnic origin in order to avoid receiving certain posts.144 \nFurthermore, his readiness to turn the party upside down in pursuit of \nhis preferred policies was demonstrated by the 'trade union discussion'; \nand his behaviour after Lenin's death hardly betokens a person \nreluctant to inherit the position of dominant party leader. \nNevertheless in the winter of 1920-1921, while Lenin enjoyed the \nappearance of good health, Trotski fought him over policy only; there \nwas no attempt to reduce Lenin in importance. \nTrotski was undoubtedly putting a sincere case, and he was right to \nargue that the trade-union question touched on almost every aspect of \nthe party's strategy: state power, economic reconstruction, workers' \nrights, local self-government; but he should also have known that the \naverage party official, tried and tested in the heat of the military \nconflict of 1917-1920, felt that debate was a luxury which was ill-\naffordable by the Bolsheviks. Scarcely a month \npassed when Lenin omitted to make such a comment. Instead the \ntalk among Bolshevik party officials was that, with his power-base in \nthe Red Army, he might become the Napoleon of the Soviet regime. \nBolsheviks thought much about the precedents in the history of the \nFrench Revolution. Trotski's non-Bolshevik past and his abrasive \ntreatment of the party in 1918-1920 gave grounds for the fear that a \nBonapartist counterrevolution might be undertaken under his leader-\nship.J46 \nLenin meanwhile gained from his evident wish to deflect the party \nfrom a damaging discussion. Even Aleksandr Shlyapnikov in the Workers' \nOpposition spoke respectfully about him (whereas Shlyapnikov's \nabhorrence of Trotski was so intense that he refused to make common \ncause with him in 1923 when Trotski at last spoke in favour of internal \nparty reform). \n175 \nas if the sole way open to them to prove that they were still Joyal \nBolsheviks was to refer affectionately to 'Vladimir Ilich' . Zinoviev hurried round the \nmajor party organisations on Lenin's behalf, talking stingingly about \nthe People's Commissar for Military Affairs. Those Bolsheviks who \nhad been at the front in the Civil War, he emphasised, had scant \nunderstanding of conditions and possibilities in the rear. Lenin would have certainly have done so if \nhe thought he could have got away with it. 151 This group, forced to \ncome off the fence dividing Lenin and Trotski, scared Lenin in 1921 by \ndeciding initially in favour of Trotski.' 153 Zinoviev's platform, more \nthan Lenin's, conceded that appointmentism was a problem in the \nparty. Lenin revelled in verbal \nambiguity. At a time of strikes and mutinies there could be little \n 176 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprospect of prolonging their existence, and Trotski complied. Party organisation after organisation, despite \nTrotski's visits to them in person, came over to Lenin's side. Weeks \nbefore the Tenth Party Congress Lenin had won the 'trade union \ncontroversy' . A cabal of fifteen leading 'Leninists' was addressed by \nhim as the Congress gathered in Moscow. Here Lenin put the case that \nTrotski should be included on their slate for election since he would be \nin a permanent minority in the Central Committee and disabled from \ncausing a split in the party. But Lenin also insisted that the main supporters ofTrotski \nshould be removed; Krestinski, Preobrazhenski, Serebryakov and \nI. Lenin must already have had it in mind to give full \nmembership in the Politburo to Zinoviev in return for his part in \nTrotski's defeat, and discussions were under way to fill the Secretariat \nwith officials who had taken Lenin's line in the winter of 1920-1921.'59 \nIn addition, Lenin planned to call a meeting of all those who agreed \nwith him on the trade unions. Lenin was amused: 'What's this I hear from a died-in-the-wool old \nfactionalist. \nAt the evening session Lenin delivered the long-awaited Central \nCommittee political report. 16s \nLenin's implicit argument was that the peasantry's capacity to \ndestabilise the authorities had been underestimated. Lenin declared that the \nfactional disagreements in the Bolshevik party were an intellectual \nluxury. Lenin described it as a 'petit-bourgeois counter-\nrevolution' more dangerous than the White invasions of Kolchak, \nDenikin and Yudenich. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry. 171 The \nreal drama lay with Lenin's strategical change since the previous \nCongress. Lenin's attitude to the Workers' \nOpposition would only cause further disunity. Osinski, for the Democratic Centralists, \nagreed with Lenin that syndicalism had grown as a force in the \nparty. Nor was Lenin immune from criticism. Sosnovski, a supporter of Trotski in the trade-union contro-\nversy, quipped that Lenin had barely mentioned the workers.176 Back came Yuri Milonov for the \nWorkers' Opposition, claiming that Lenin as Sovnarkom chairman \n Less Politics. It was his contention that the strict line on the trade unions \naccepted by Lenin at the previous Party Congress was responsible for \nstimulating working-class discontent. 178 Furthermore, a certain Rafail \ndenied that the trade-union controversy had been the luxury depicted \nby Lenin. In Moscow, as he pointed out, 'the arch-democrat Stalin' \nhad been organising Lenin's faction as if an internal party war were \nbeing fought. Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends. When the \ntime arrived for Lenin to respond to his critics, he was ill-disposed to \ncompromise. 180 That evening, \nat session four, Lenin's report was approved by 514 votes against 47 for \nthe Democratic Centralists and 45 for the Workers' Opposition. Lenin did not participate; indeed he did not re-appear at the \nspeaker's lectern until three days later. With the recent conquest of the Transcaucasus in \neveryone's mind, Stalin stressed the party's objective of equal rights for \nall nationalities; and he expatiated a bit on the tendency of several \nRussian Bolsheviks to indulge in 'Russian Great-Power chauvinism'. 185 \nFurthermore, Lenin in 1921 would indubitably have been annoyed by \nStalin's dismissiveness about national self-determination. The slogan \nremained dear to Lenin. Zatonski from the Ukraine argued against the creeping \nGreat Russian chauvinism and stated that Stalin seemed to deny that \nany republics independent from Moscow were conceivable. He also \nconfessed that he himself, a Bolshevik leader, failed to understand the \nprecise nature of the treaty between Soviet Russia and Soviet \nUkraine. 188 Anastas Mikoyan and Mikola Skrypnik, too, complained \nabout Stalin's vagueness. Still Lenin kept himself out of the \nway. \nLenin played his part again. 195 \nNothing was left to chance, and Lenin on the same day as the last of \nthe emergency sessions penned drafts of his two motions on the \nsyndicalist deviation and on party unity. 196 In the first motion, the \nWorkers' Opposition was condemned for is allegedly anti-Marxist \nideas; in the second, factional activity in general was banned on pain of \nexpulsion from the Central Committee for any faction's leader (and \nfrom the party for the faction as a whole). He emphasised that in February 1920, so far \nfrom being unorthodox as a Bolshevik, he had put forward a version of \neconomic reform not totally dissimilar from the current proposal to \nabolish grain requisitioning; he revealed also that Lenin at the time had \naccused him of 'Free Trade-ism'.200 But Trotski did little to promote \nhis case on the unions beyond asserting that the Central Committee's \nmotion was so lacking in fluency that Lenin could not have scrutinised \nit closely.202 \nTrotski retorted very reasonably that he had infringed no disciplinary \ncode; he quoted, too, Lenin's statement at the Ninth Party Congress \nagainst the 'rubbish' spoken on behalf of democratic practices in the \ntrade unions. As \n 182 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe went down to the expected defeat, he lamely declared that the trade-\nunion resolution would not survive in effect through to the Eleventh \nParty Congress. All 479 votes were cast to confirm Lenin's membership. Out of \nthe other Politburo members, Stalin came sixth in the Central \nCommittee list, Trotski a humiliating tenth and Zinoviev - who had \nbeen the peripatetic champion of Lenin's line on the trade unions in the \nwinter - an even more distressing eighteenth. \nOnly then did Lenin step forward with the Central Committee report \non the end to grain requisitioning. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'.206 At present the peasants were \ndiscontented, and Lenin added: 'Classes cannot be tricked. 213 He also implicitly challenged \nLenin's assumption that the new policy would somehow be more \norderly in implementation.214 \nTwo speakers followed in Lenin's support, including Evgeni \nPreobrazhenski: the Bolshevik Left contained many who saw that \nsome reform was urgently necessary. Frumkin, who \nworked under Tsyurupa in the People's Commissariat of Food \nSupplies, argued that Lenin's proposal would condemn workers to \ndeath by starvation. 215 \nLenin's summary speech at the end was characteristically combative. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'.218 \nLenin had handled the Congress superbly. Lenin was \nvital to the re-orientation of policies.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'.220 And yet even he, the leading figure on the Bolshevik \nRight, took a stern view. Then, in the closing minutes, Lenin quickly \nintroduced the two debates on party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist \ndeviation.", "Agree_To_Aleksei_1920": "", "Capitalism_1920": " The \nclosure of enterprises; the migration into the villages; the malnutrition \nand disease in the towns; the conscription into the armed forces: all this \nhad led to a collapse in the size, morale and political 'consciousness' of \nthe working class. His speech on 3 \nNovember 1920 set out the following basic proposition: 'The \nadministrative-economic apparatus is nothing but the union's produc-\ntion organ, i. The figures of industrial output were depressing. War Communism had to work better. \nLenin rejoiced. This was not capitalism, but it was not much like War \nCommunism either.41 Lenin \nreminded his audience: 'A question such as the existence of the Soviet \nrepublic alongside capitalist countries, a Soviet republic surrounded by \ncapitalist countries: this is such an intolerable thing for capitalism that \nany opportunity will be grasped to resume war. The political \ndivision of world capitalist imperialism was vital. The rights and activities of trade unions were a foil for \nbroader deliberations on centralism, hierarchy, electivity, social rights \nand economic development in a socialist state. The notion that trade \nunions should help to raise productivity had been settled at the Ninth \nParty Congress in March 1920.65 But Trotski had given himself up to \nabstractions: 'Why is the working class to be defended, and from \nwhom, since the bourgeoisie doesn't exist and the state is a workers' \nstate.'81 \nTOWARDS THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY \nThe 'trade union discussion' prolonged the diversion of the leadership's \nattention from problems which had begun to be addressed, however \nimperfectly, at the Ninth Party Conference of September 1920.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A. Private enterprise was a pejorative term \nin the party. An ideology which had been solidly anti-entrepreneurial \nbefore 1917 had become diamond-hard in the Civil War. \n169 \n(whereas the real problem was the state's relationship with the \npeasants). A free national \nmarket was not envisaged.130 \nBut Lenin held firm. The wrangles of \n1920-1921 were all the more astounding. \nSo, too, was the party's acceptance of the desirability of foreign \n 178 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncapitalist concessionaires taking a stake in Soviet industry.169 An economy based on large-scale units of \nproduction would not quickly be achieved. In a phrase which was becoming conventional, \nLenin suggested that the nub of the matter was 'the relation of the \nworking class to the peasantry'. Freedom of circulation is freedom of trade, and \nfreedom of trade means a return to capitalism.'208 Any communist who thought the country's \neconomic base to be reconstructible within three years was fantasising. \nExisting collective farms were examples of how not to run an \neconomy. Lenin, the denouncer of global capitalist imperialism, even \ncontended that the policy on concessionnaires was an attempt to form \n'a bloc with the capitalism of the advanced countries'. It was tantamount to stating \nthat the October Revolution should search fondly for fraternal \ncapitalist regimes.219 \nKamenev forbore to pick up Lenin's impromptu call for a 'bloc with \nthe capitalism of advanced countries'.", "Party_Leadership_1920": " His espousal of moderate reform at the \nNinth Party Conference in September 1920 was unaccompanied by \nimplementation in his own political base in Petrograd. \nThe most radical proposal for changing policy in the Bolshevik party \nhad come from Trotski in February 1920. The wartime \npressures for party unity were waning. Solidarity of some basic kind \nwith the party leader was essential. Party discipline had been infringed. \nInterested senior party officials were invited to the session of 16 \nFebruary 1921 to debate whether to sign a deal with foreign \nentrepreneurs willing to take a stake in the oil industry. Zinoviev, pseudo-prophet of internal party democracy \nsince September 1920, clamped down on Workers' Oppositionists in \nPetrograd.'81 \nTOWARDS THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY \nThe 'trade union discussion' prolonged the diversion of the leadership's \nattention from problems which had begun to be addressed, however \nimperfectly, at the Ninth Party Conference of September 1920.87 The Socialist Revolutionary A.89 \nThe Politburo met again on 2 February 1921.96 \n 168 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd yet, although a psychological gap had been crossed on 2 \nFebruary, a vaster ideological chasm lay ahead.

Lenin was the undoubted \nparty leader and was held responsible for all existing trends.199 \nAt session twelve, on 14 March, Zinoviev opened the debate on the \nsubject which had engaged party leaders in previous months: the trade \nunions.", "Party_Leadership_1921": " No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent.8 Only at this stage did the \ncentral party leadership make its intentions fully public. The central \nparty apparatus had scrutinised and sanctioned the details. 39 Almost certainly the temporising was caused by \ndisagreements among central party leaders.48 The rest of the central \nparty leadership, too, wanted to hold the republics of the Transcau-\ncasus to heel. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo.70 \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n197 \nThis emphasis was strengthened by the failure of the 'March Action' \nundertaken by the German Communist Party, on the initiative of Bela \nKun and other representatives of the Communist International, to \noverthrow the elected German government and seize power in the last \nweek of March 1921. His \npamphlet On The Food Tax and his subsequent speeches to the Tenth \nParty Conference, in May 1921, concentrated on domestic economics \nand politics at the expense of the international situation except insofar \nas he mentioned concessionaires. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. 126 239 delegates assembled \nin the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin on 26 May 1921 to hear their \nleadership's account of themselves. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 169 The party and state \nauthorities could not be accused of inactivity: instructions, decrees and \nlaws issued like a flood through a broken dam in the second half of \n1921.' 173 The Eleventh Party Conference returned to such \nmatters in December 1921. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed.", "Party_Leadership_1922": " The display of unity at the \nEleventh Party Congress reinforced the image of a unified central \nleadership. And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922.45 \nBy early March 1922 he had appeared to have won;46 but already on \n15 May he was worried enough to write to Stalin as General Secretary \nof the Central Committee requesting the Politburo's approval for a \ndirective confirming the monopoly. The controversy was bound to erupt as soon as he \nsucceeded in participating more closely in the deliberations of the \ncentral party leadership. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. But an adjutant was required to run \nthe party machinery in the provinces. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin. 125 \nThe Orgburo met on II August and set up a commission consisting \nof a representative from each of the republics as well as the following \ncentrally-based leaders: Stalin, V.' 179 He had in mind the Twelfth Party Congress, \nscheduled to convene in spring 1923.

The party leaders, with few exceptions, were exterminated. The party leadership \nhad brought this about. The cultural \nimperatives of the party were enormous. The supervisory \ntasks of party and government should be united. There was 'bureaucracy' even in the party. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission).83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup.", "Worsening_In_Circumstances_1920": " Agriculture, too, was in a disastrous condition. The wrangles of \n1920-1921 were all the more astounding.", "Exhausting_And_Shaming_1921": "85 Rumblings of the dispute were audible throughout \nsummer and autumn 1921.", "Economic_Policy_1921": " 7 The Rifle and Sickle \nDEVELOPING THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY \nThere are many examples in history of governments embarking on \nreforms without intuition about the potential repercussions. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. The genie \nof capitalism had been released back into the economy.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. He wished to ensure that the \nentire Central Committee was responsible to the New Economic \nPolicy. The \nmanifesto committed the government to buying industrial products \nabroad so that it would be worthwhile for the peasantry to maximise \ntheir sown area in anticipation of trading it later in the year. The economy \nwas collapsing. Factory production in \n1921 was a fifth of the total registered before the Great War.29 In these circumstances the \nNew Economic Policy would rapidly have to be expanded if the Soviet \nauthorities were to extricate themselves from disaster. First \nsuppression, then economic reform. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo.63 The \nlinkage with the same question was perceptible also with the \ndevelopment of policy on 'concessions'. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism. The basis of the New Economic Policy was found wanting by \nmany party officials, activists and ordinary workers. Even so, he had to admit that no profitable \nconcessions were brought into being in 1921 -or even, as he was later \nto note, in 1922. His \npamphlet On The Food Tax and his subsequent speeches to the Tenth \nParty Conference, in May 1921, concentrated on domestic economics \nand politics at the expense of the international situation except insofar \nas he mentioned concessionaires. The evidence about the prospects of \nthe major capitalist powers was patchy and ambiguous. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West.89 \nNor did his letter go beyond economic parameters.95 \n'ON THE FOOD TAX ' \nLenin sought to clarify the New Economic Policy with a pamphlet. Apparently the New Economic Policy was old hat.91 His main point was that 'state capitalism' was no bad \nobjective in a country where small-scale private production was the \npredominant form of economic activity. After the October \nRevolution he had retained and strengthened the state grain-trade \nmonopoly; in spring 1921 he was insisting on its abolition. Private \ncommerce was essential to the New Economic Policy, and he knew \nabout this contrast futt wett. 101 \nIt was also incorrect of him to assert that the New Economic Policy \nrepeated measures induced solely by the exigencies of Civil War. At the same time it allowed him \nto suggest that this same New Economic Policy, which was a retreat \nfrom socialism in some ways, was also a further advance towards it. He indicated a wish \nto produce 'a uniform economic plan for the entire state' .'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire.' 108 The \nNew Economic Policy would fail unless capitalism returned to flourish \nin a legal framework.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable. The New Economic Policy offered a starting \npoint and a destination; it did not provide a route. 120 The concern was that the anger at the \nNew Economic Policy was not confined to oppositionists but was a \nwidely-held feeling in the party. The New Economic Policy was a massive \njolt to the party. He \nhad come to recognise that an even further extension of the New \nEconomic Policy was vital. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. 131 Their words were like extra \nchapters to Lenin's booklet; they constituted a case for New Economic \nPolicy not merely to be accepted but also extended into other areas of \nthe economy. 132 Vareikis talked of the hostility to the \nNew Economic Policy in the party. But the extension of the New Economic Policy was \nanother matter altogether for them. To Vareikis's mind, the New Economic Policy abandoned \nthis approach. Describing it as the \ntrickiest aspect of the New Economic Policy, he again expressed the \nfear lest it should find expression in internal party factions. The irritation displayed by speakers in the \nearlier discussion of the New Economic Policy had at any rate been \nunaccompanied by specific proposals on policy. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it.158 Co-\nops, small-scale private industry, monetary stabilisation became \nintegral segments of the New Economic Policy. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. The \njob of selling the New Economic Policy to the party was far from over. In June 1921 Sovnarkom announced its \nintention to achieve 'a healthy monetary circulation' . It is precisely now with our \"new economic policy\" \nthat we're correcting a whole series of mistakes, that we're learning \nhow to construct a socialist building in a petty-bourgeois country \nwithout mistakes. Passionate criticisms of major aspects of \nthe New Economic Policy were made. His main point - an ominous one for all Conference \nparticipants - was that the New Economic Policy offered little to the \npoor peasants. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future. Its objectives for the future economy began \nfrom the premise that cities, factories and large-scale social units were \nthe crucible of the development of communism. 186 A further reason \nlay in the origins of the New Economic Policy. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed. The New \nEconomic Policy, as it had evolved after the Tenth Party Congress, had \ninvolved the abolition of important aspects of the state's authority to \nintervene in the operation of industry, agriculture and trade.", "Trade_Union_1921": " Factory production in \n1921 was a fifth of the total registered before the Great War. A tacit understanding therefore \nemerged between Lenin and Stalin that other more pressing matters of \npolitics and economy should engage their attention: the fractiousness \nof the 'trade union controversy' was considered an ill-affordable \nluxury. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. \nNor should factories be expected to give social-security support to their \nworkers; and collective wage bargaining through the trade unions was \nre-established in November168 Furthermore, the quest for foreign \nconcessionaires able and willing to assist the country's economic \nreconstruction, especially in the timber and oil industries, continued.", "Obliged_To_Attend_1921": " Even so, he had to admit that no profitable \nconcessions were brought into being in 1921 -or even, as he was later \nto note, in 1922.", "Bolshevik_Regime_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. Every Central \nCommittee member approved this with reluctance, taking it for granted \nthat a resurgence of private commerce would strengthen the social \nforces in the country hostile to the Bolsheviks.2 Well as he had managed the \nCongress, Lenin had also had much luck. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. Connoisseurs of his style were able to recall that in 1918, despite \nhaving being the protagonist of a separate peace treaty with Germany \nand Austria-Hungary, he insisted that others in the Bolshevik party \nleadership should go out to Brest-Litovsk to do the signing. Certainly \nhe could plead pre-occupation with other business which was being \nreported to him: the Anglo-Soviet negotiations; the Kronstadt and \nTambov revolts; the attempted seizure of power in Berlin by the \nGerman Communist Party with their 'March Action'; the worsening \nconflicts in the Soviet trade union leadership; industrial strikes in \nSoviet Russia; dissent in the Bolshevik party; the activities of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries; the establishment of 'Soviet \npower' in the Transcaucasus. 5 \nLenin was in the chair. The \nparty monopolised power not only in theory but also in reality; the \nsupreme issue on the agenda of Soviet politics was not to be devolved \nto the formal state authorities until policy had been fixed by the \nBolshevik leadership. 10 Lenin was staying \nout of the highlight. 13 \nThus the potential region of greatest grain surplus in the Soviet-ruled \nrepublics was to be exempted from Lenin's reform. The antagonism of \nthe Ukraine-based Bolshevik leadership, already expressed at the Tenth \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nParty Congress, may have had an influence; 14 but probably Kamenev \nand his colleagues- with Lenin in agreement in the background- were \nthemselves worried about a resurgence of Ukrainian private trade \nbefore the completion of the transfer of land from gentry and rich \npeasants. The \nBolshevik party's fear of kulak-led resistance to its authority was so \nstrong that even the Ukrainian equivalent of the committees of the \nvillage poor, abolished in Russia in December 1918, remained in \nexistence until the mid-1920s. \nBolshevik leaders before and during the Party Congress had considered \nideas on reform limited to bartering between the peasant producer and \nboth the state procurer and the individual consumer; private traders \nhad not been envisaged.t 8 \nStill Lenin kept his head down. Lenin was lying low. There was conflict between the People's Commissariat of \nFood Supplies and the Central Statistical Administration in the \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n189 \nestimation of the grainstocks available; and Lenin, with his expertise in \nthe geography of agriculture going back to his 1899 book The \nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia, was naturally drawn into \narbitrating. Antonov-Ovseenko, sent by the \nPolitburo as political commissar to suppress the Tambov peasant \nrevolt, wrote to Lenin in alarm at the quota assigned to the local \nauthorities.27 The reform was \ntherefore still a tremendous gamble by Lenin; it might cause more \nproblems than it solved. \nCONQUEST OF EMPIRE \nAt the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently Lenin had demanded a \nunion between workers and peasants. Gentle towards the peasants he met, Lenin was brutal in his \ndispensations of policy. \nRepression was at its most intense in the grain-producing areas of \nRussia.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved. In this tense situation no \nquarter would be offered to the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolution-\naries. Any of their leaders discovered in Moscow and Petro grad were to \nbe arrested on sight; the fitful existence allowed to their parties in the \nCivil War was to be terminated.35 Propa-\nganda would, Lenin hoped, eventually redress the discredit into which \nthe Bolshevik regime had fallen. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921.36 Armenians had followed the Azeri example in \nFebruary 1921. 37 The Bolsheviks had \nalienated the non-Russians to a lesser extent than had the Whites in \nprevious years; but this led no party leader to think that the 'national \nquestion' had been solved. On the contrary, the lands of the former \nRussian empire were seething with political unrest among the various \nnations and ethnic groups. \nThe conquest of the Transcaucasus had meant that the Russian \nSocialist Federal Soviet Republic (or RSFSR), Ukraine and Belorussia \nwere joined as independent Soviet republics by Azerbaidzhan, Armenia \nand Georgia.38 But the preferred long-term ties \namong all six Soviet republics were not specified. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin.40 Lenin wished to form a \nfederation of Russia, Ukraine and other republics whereas Stalin \nwanted to incorporate these other republics in the RSFSR with rights \nof 'autonomy' of the type inaugurated with the Bashkir Republic in \n1919. To treat Ukraine in such a way, according \nto Lenin was 'chauvinism'.41 Russia and its Bolshevik leaders had to go \nout of their way to demonstrate their anti-nationalist credentials; and \nhe was annoyed that his nearest major ally in the party on these \nquestions had turned against him. For \nLenin, the addition of Ukraine to a federal multinational state would \nmerely have been the prelude to the additions of Poland and Germany. Perhaps Stalin, unlike Lenin, was \nalso aiming to have as strong and large an RSFSR as possible so as to \n 192 \nLenin: A Political Life \nact as a counterweight to a future Soviet Germany; but Lenin the \nRussian was less Russocentric than Stalin the Georgian, and he was \napparently untroubled about a Soviet federation in Central and \nEastern Europe which might not be dominated by Russia. \nHe remained People's Commissar for Nationality Affairs, despite \ndemanding to resign on 24 November 1921, and had been used by the \nPolitburo to supervise decisions about the borderlands in general and \nthe Transcaucasus in particular during the Civil War.45 Lenin could not count on defeating Stalin's \nconstitutional project in open party debate. The Central Committee, its Politburo and its Orgburo in \nMoscow were to instruct and control all party bodies throughout the \nrepublics, and these 'local' bodies were to direct the republican \ngovernments as Moscow demanded. A tacit understanding therefore \nemerged between Lenin and Stalin that other more pressing matters of \npolitics and economy should engage their attention: the fractiousness \nof the 'trade union controversy' was considered an ill-affordable \nluxury. \nNot that the affairs of the non-Russian nationalities were overlooked \nby Lenin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. \nInitially Lenin, the lifelong harrier of the Mensheviks, advocated the \nquest of 'an acceptable compromise' with the Georgian Menshevik \nleader Noi Zhordania. Such advice from Moscow at a time when the \nRussian Mensheviks were being thrown into the prisons of the Cheka. On 14 April 1921 he sent an open letter to 'the \ncommunist comrades of Azerbaidzhan, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan \nand the Mountain Republic' demanding that local conditions be \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n193 \nrespected. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. \nHis reasoning was not just that the region was predominantly agrarian \nor that Bolshevik rule was under threat. On 3 April 1921 a Politburo decision was taken to require \nthem to submit any treaties with Turkey to Moscow before \nratification. \nThus it came about that Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin's full support, \nsought to reinforce control over each republic by constraining them \nwithin a Transcaucasian Federation. \nMyasnikyan, who had a leading role in the Armenian Bolshevik \nleadership, to appear at the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in \nDecember 1921 to demand the Transcaucasian Federation's creation. 53 \nStill there was no deliberation as to the permanent arrangements to \nbe made among the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and the proposed \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTranscaucasian Federation. Stalin wrote to Lenin on 13 January 1922 \nrepeating his commitment to the incorporation of all of them within \nthe RSFSR. It was certain \nunnamed comrades, according to Stalin, who demanded immediate \naction. Possibly he \nwas content to see the Transcaucasian Federation, which was \npromulgated despite Georgian Bolshevik resistance on 12 March, \ncome into existence before moving on to a grander constitutional \nproject. Clashes between the Central \nCommittee in Moscow and the Bolshevik politicians of Ukraine had \noccurred since 1918. 56 On 11 March 1922 the Ukrainian Politburo complained \nto the Central Committee in Moscow about a series of infringements of \nthe republic's rights as embodied in the treaty with the RSFSR.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party. He was not only an avid centraliser \nwho imposed Moscow's policies on the peripheral regions; he was also \nthe leader most often called upon by Moscow to mediate in conflicts \nbetween one region and another. The spats over the territorial limits of \nBashkiria in 1919 were followed by several others within the RSFSR; \nand, most notoriously, a menacing disturbance broke out between the \nAzerbaidzhani and Armenian Soviet republics over the ownership of \nNagorny Karabakh. In 1920 the Politburo had ruled in favour of \nArmenia, but in 1921 Nagorny Karabakh - despite being heavily \npopulated by Armenians- was handed to Azerbaidzhan.59 \nSooner or later, however, Stalin and Lenin would clash over Stalin's \nproject for 'autonomisation'. He \npromoted non-Russian Bolsheviks to high office.60 Furthermore, his duties as \nPeople's Commissar for Nationality Affairs left him in no doubt how \nfrail the Bolshevik party was in the non-Russian republics. Bolsheviks \nwere few in number, were usually disproportionately drawn from \nethnic Russians as well as from persons who had joined the party late \nin the Civil War.61 The arguments for letting republican Bolshevik \norganisations take full charge of their respective republics were not self-\nevident. To Stalin it must have seemed that Lenin had not thought out \na responsible party policy. The will to retain the peoples of the Soviet \nlands subject to the party's power and policies, by force if the need \narose, was common to both men. Stalin was therefore unprepared for \nthe intensity of Lenin's hostility when it revealed itself from autumn \n1922. \nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS \nBoth Lenin and Stalin at any rate knew that the 'national question' was \ninseparably linked to issues of foreign policy. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism. 64 \nThe Politburo was perplexed as to how to develop a line which \nwould simultaneously enhance territorial security, facilitate the spread \nof socialist revolutions and attract investment from foreign capitalists. Lenin rightly believed that, however successful they were with \nthese important but lesser states, it would be progress with the Allies \nthat would determine the Soviet regime's survival.67 \nLenin also knew that nothing could be counted upon in advance. In \npublic he had argued, on 6 December 1920, that Russian participation \nin world trade was necessary for economic recovery everywhere.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921. \nZinoviev suffered the embarrassment of having 'black-legged' against \nthe Bolshevik party in the October Revolution; he over-compensated \nfor this in the Communist International by zeal for foreign socialist \nadventures (which may also explain the roisterings of his fellow alleged \nblack-leg Kamenev in London in 1920).72 At the time \nLenin did not comment. Lenin's diary in \nMarch was filled with considerations about the tax in kind, the \nGeorgian operation, the Kronstadt and Tambov revolts, the arrange-\nment of foreign concessions, the trade treaties, the Tenth Party \nCongress. \nThe episode shows how even Lenin did not control his colleagues \nover all policies. Equally Lenin's political distance from the March Action \ndemonstrates the intensity of his pre-occupation with the multifaceted \ncrisis confronting the Soviet state. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession.' The opposition, according to Lenin, \nwas supposedly motivated by 'Donbass patriotism'. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. On 10 \nOctober 1921 Lenin wrote to Trotski approvingly about the \nnegotiations in progress with the German high command. Soviet \nRussia was on the edge of the abyss.80 His proposals for Baku, Grozny, \nDon bass and Kamchatka were contentious, and he may have judged it \nunnecessary to cause further dispute by raising doubts about the \nimminence of socialist revolutions in Europe. Lenin's favourite \nassertion that the Bolshevik party should focus on practical tasks and \nshould give up its chattering carried the implication that theorising \nshould be kept in the background.81 Yet Lenin \nfrequently tried to have his cake and eat it too. Lenin \npreferred to get on with government and to leave speculation to others. 'Left' and 'right' were no longer easily definable terms \namong Bolsheviks. On international relations, Lenin \n 200 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspoke in the most general terms to the difficulties of the labour \nmovement abroad; but, although he talked about the inception of a \ncrisis in world capitalism, he used vague language and implied no \ncriticism of Trotski.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition.88 Even then, Lenin is recorded as having mentioned co-\nexistence without breathing anything about its being peaceful. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. Lenin himself put \ninverted commas around 'co-habitation', thereby signalling his \nrecognition that an eventual violent clash between socialism and \ncapitalism was probable. The political \nirreconcilability of the Soviet regime and the capitalist West was a \nfoundation stone of his world-view. Toning down \nTrotski's presentation, Lenin at the Ninth Congress of Soviets \ncharacterised capitalism with the followint words: 'What has been \nachieved is a certain fragile equilibrium'. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen. An electoral curia for 'parasites' \n(or the former middle and upper classes) would not put the party's \npower at risk and yet would induce foreign capitalists to invest in the \nSoviet republics. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement.'93 This confidence that Bolshevism \ncould survive was to be treated by Stalin after Lenin's death as proof \nthat Lenin had believed that the building of socialism could be \ncompleted even in conditions of capitalist encirclement. Lenin had been discussing only the regime's \nsurvival rather than the implementation of all the tasks described \nbefore October 1917 in The State and Revolution. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore.94 But the state order \nof all Soviet republics remained intact despite such territorial re-\narrangements. The \nCommunist International was not formally under Moscow's control \nand could go on conducting propaganda in its own name; and, of \ncourse, the treaty in no way stipulated a dismantlement of the so-called \ndictatorship of the proletariat in the RSFSR and the other Soviet \nrepublics. On the contrary, it was aimed at active party \nmembers in Moscow and the provinces. In elucidating his own \nintentions, Lenin had to work hard to keep fellow Bolsheviks on his \nside. \nIt was partly for this reason that, when calling for the discontinua-\ntion of earlier measures, Lenin chose to accentuate aspects of \n 202 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncontinuity. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. Lenin repeated that the agreeing of \n'concessions' with foreign entrepreneurs would make an important \ncontribution to the resources of the Soviet state. But Lenin's \nwords involved, too, a deal of obfuscation. Of course, there had been armed struggle ever since 25 \nOctober 1917. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. He \nforesaw the party's reluctance to abandon ultra-centralist state \neconomic intervention, and he wanted to disseminate the idea that \nthe New Economic Policy simply restored measures that had once had \nthe general concurrence of Bolsheviks. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. 104 \nLenin still wrote as a confident social engineer.' 106 He had largely \nstopped bothering with arguments put forward by non-Bolsheviks; but \non this occasion he considered the case against terror put by Martov \nthe Menshevik and Chernov the Socialist-Revolutionary.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. 'It is impossible to distinguish speculation from \n 204 \nLenin: A Political Life \n\"correct\" trade,' Lenin added, ' if speculation is to be understood in the \npolitico-economic sense. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. 110 \nTurning to peacetime tasks, Lenin declared that 'bureaucratism' \naffected all corners of the state's activities. It was worse in his opinion \nin Moscow than in the localities. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'. \nHe recommended that leading members of People's Commissariats \nshould be transferred from Moscow to rural district soviets. But his remedy \nwas hopelessly inadequate; and, in recommending it, Lenin showed \nhimself to be out of touch with those many Bolshevik leaders who by \nnow enjoyed and wanted to prolong their life of privilege and power in \nthe capital. Bolsheviks had to buckle down to \ntheir own education: 'We must not be scared to admit that here there is \nstill much that can and must be learned from the capitalist.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. This was \nembarrassing for the Bolsheviks, who prided themselves on being the \n'vanguard' of the working class; but conditions in the towns could not \nbe improved until trade with the villages, which necessitated material \nincentives being given to the peasantry, was restored. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. Progress might be impeded, and it remained \nLenin's contention that it would take decades before socialism could be \nattained in Russia. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. The \nBolsheviks were few, but they were united: 'And we know what we \nwant. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. Opinion among \nMoscow Bolsheviks was very agitated; the City Party Committee \nsecretary P. 121 But Lenin, when he heard of \nthis, was infuriated. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. Dzierzynski as a supporter of internal \nparty discipline backed Lenin. 124 \nQuietly the matter was dropped, and Lenin was left to allow his ire to \nexpire. 125 Perforce the Conference's organisation was \nhurried and ramshackle; but Lenin was reconciled to its necessity. It could not be imposed without the co-\noperation of the party leadership in Moscow and the provinces. Once more the individual performance of Lenin would be \ncrucial. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. 131 Their words were like extra \nchapters to Lenin's booklet; they constituted a case for New Economic \nPolicy not merely to be accepted but also extended into other areas of \nthe economy. Vareikis, like speakers after him, \nattacked Lenin. Vareikis, a Bolshevik \nsophisticated in the party's doctrines, challenged the Marxist validity \nof Lenin's attitude to the peasantry. Lenin in previous works had \ndescribed the peasantry as a feudal class in an advanced stage of \ndisintegration, under the impact of capitalist economic development, \ninto two antagonistic new classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; \nhe had also stressed in the Party Programme that the party should \nenhance the interests of the poorer and middling segments of the \npeasantry. He scrutinised Lenin's pamphlet \nwith acidic wit. Chubar added to Lenin's woes. Always the target was Lenin. There had been no such Congress or \nConference in the history of the Bolshevik party, not even in the Brest-\nLitovsk dispute. In short, Lenin's report had been out of touch with the real \nsituation.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement. Lenin had been absent for most of the report. 149 Yet \nLenin failed to add was that the Politburo had filled the breach. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . 50 \nNonetheless Lenin had indisputably carried a greater load than the \nrest, and the load involved a concatenation of crises in the economy, \nadministration, politics, security and foreign policy. \nLenin had seen red. Coming from Lenin, it sounded utterly serious. Nobody liked the New Economic Policy: \nnot even Lenin exulted in it. Essentially he wanted \nconfirmation that he had done his best and that his measures were \n 212 \nLenin: A Political Life \napproved. No other Bolshevik leader could have saved the foundations \nof the New Economic Policy at this Conference in quite this way. Lenin \nsat down, battered but victorious at last. Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. \nAlready, as he admitted, there were controversies among Politburo \nmembers as to whether the Communist International confronted a \nperiod of 'quiescence' when the capitalist economies would stabilise \nthemselves and prevent revolutionary conturbation. Bumazhny attacked Lenin. Lenin had misjudged the needs of situation: \nthe ordinary party members as wen as the Bolshevik inte11ectua1 elite \nhad to be addressed. But Lenin replied dismissively. This time Lenin reacted more diplomatically. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. But the Russian Communist Party \ncould not guess when it would happen. 163 \nFor the moment the Bolsheviks had to elaborate their measures on \nthe premise that the October Revolution stood alone. The \nConference had been gruelling, and had put Lenin on his mettle. \nBut nobody could any longer state that the reform had been slipped \ninto the Bolshevik official projections without sustained consultation \nand ratification. 164 \n 214 \nLenin: A Political Life \nDIVIDED RETREAT \nThe Conference had barely finished when, supplied with suitable drafts \nfrom the Central Committee, Sovnarkom embarked on a legislative \ncampaign to extend the New Economic Policy. The lines sketched by \nLenin, Milyutin, Khinchuk, Sviderski, and Preobrazhenski were \npursued with panache. Nikolai Valentinov, an ex-Bolshevik who had many contacts \nwith the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, recorded having heard that \nVareikis shouted that Lenin had lopped off 'whole chapters of \nMarxism'. It was not until October \nthat Lenin recommenced his public defence of reform. Commemorat-\ning the fourth anniversary of the Bolshevik party's seizure of power, he \nwrote in Pravda: 'Would that such a global affair could be begun \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n215 \nwithout failures and without mistakes.' 171 His only other major statements came in two \nspeeches: the first to the regime's educational officials, the speech to the \nMoscow Bolshevik Party Provincial Conference in late October. Indeed cognoscenti of Lenin's agrarian analysis in 1917 \nwould have noticed how closely Preobrazhenski followed it;179 Lenin \n 216 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncould not dismiss his critic out of hand. But Preobrazhenski, who until \nthen had worked harmoniously with Lenin, irritated him more than \nany other leading Bolshevik opponent at the time. Lenin castigated the 'empty' phrases and \n'boring' expressions of intent. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future.' 182 \nThis was the sort of rhetorical souffle which, if cooked by a \nProvisional Government minister in 1917 or a Bolshevik opositionist in \n1918-1920, Lenin would have relished puncturing. In \nthis he had the advantage that, at least by midsummer, no central or \nlocal Bolshevik leader seriously proposed that the Politburo should re-\nintroduce food-supplies requisitioning. It was \npredictable that not all his fellow Bolsheviks were reconciled to the \nfurther measures on trade, finance and industry. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. 183 \nIn fact all Bolshevik leaders were committed to the reinforcement of \ncentral state planning sooner or later; and Lenin was no exception \neither in 1921 or thereafter. Furthermore, he was determined that any \ndiscussion about the New Economic Policy should involve only \nBolsheviks. He could not stress too heavily that Bolshevik hegemony \nover contemporary issues of politics, economics and culture should be \nmaintained, 184 and he kept a weather eye open for those anti-\nBolsheviks seeking to take advantage of the reforms introduced by \nthe Politburo. Bolsheviks arguing among themselves were one \nthing; Bolsheviks indulging their enemies by allowing them access to \nthe printing press was entirely another. Even as Lenin had been \ninitiating discussions on agrarian reform in February 1921, he was \nchairing Sovnarkom sessions which required Gosplan to draw up a \nsingle comprehensive plan for all sectors of the economy. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed. Scarcely had the ashes of the \n'trade union discussion' been raked into the earth than Trotski and \nLenin were lighting a touch-paper for yet another inflammation of the \nparty. No wonder that \nLenin had been acting cautiously with his day-to-day tactics since the \nTenth Party Conference.", "Attend_To_Justify_1921": "", "Socialist_Revolutionaries_1921": " The Bolsheviks were Marxists; they also had come through \na Civil War which, in their estimation, had been won by measures on \nproduction and distribution which had marked a movement towards \nsocialism. No Bolshevik leader regarded the New Economic Policy (as \nLenin started to call it from May 1921)1 as anything other than a \nretreat forced upon the party by the peasantry's discontent. \nHaving defeated the bourgeoisie by force of arms after the October \nRevolution, they were deeply annoyed that capitalist tendencies would \nrise up again in peacetime. \n185 \n 186 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe Central Committee and its PoJitburo would have to elucidate its \npoJicy rapidly if an impact on the opinion of the peasantry was to be \nmade before the spring sowing.4 \nLenin did not want to be identified as the sole architect of the reform \nwhich, from May 1921, was regularly known as the New Economic \nPoJicy. 5 \nLenin was in the chair. The antagonism of \nthe Ukraine-based Bolshevik leadership, already expressed at the Tenth \n 188 \nLenin: A Political Life \nParty Congress, may have had an influence; 14 but probably Kamenev \nand his colleagues- with Lenin in agreement in the background- were \nthemselves worried about a resurgence of Ukrainian private trade \nbefore the completion of the transfer of land from gentry and rich \npeasants. The \nBolshevik party's fear of kulak-led resistance to its authority was so \nstrong that even the Ukrainian equivalent of the committees of the \nvillage poor, abolished in Russia in December 1918, remained in \nexistence until the mid-1920s. His first plan for the speech to \nthe Party Congress on agrarian reform in March 1921 assumed that a \n'peasant counter-revolution' was occurring against Bolshevism.32 Lenin \nwas deeply involved. In this tense situation no \nquarter would be offered to the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolution-\naries. A revolt of Bashkirs had occurred in May \n1920. Azeris, too, had risen against the Bolsheviks in the same month; \nand the Politburo discussed the weakness of the party's power in Baku \nwell into 1921. Already in June there \nhad been a spat between Lenin and Stalin. He was especially solicitous about events in the Transcau-\ncasus, and on 3 March 1921 had instructed Ordzhonikidze to avoid \nsimply repeating what had been done in Russia since the October \nRevolution. A 'slower, more cautious and more systematic transition to \nsocialism', according to Lenin, should be undertaken than in Russia. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo. 53 \nStill there was no deliberation as to the permanent arrangements to \nbe made among the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and the proposed \n 194 \nLenin: A Political Life \nTranscaucasian Federation. Stalin wrote to Lenin on 13 January 1922 \nrepeating his commitment to the incorporation of all of them within \nthe RSFSR.57 This \nrepublic, great in industry and agriculture, was always a source of \nworry for the Bolshevik party. In September 1920 the \nCongress of Peoples of the East had been organised so as to advertise \nthe virtues of the treatment of non-Russians in the Russian Socialist \nFederal Soviet Republic to the rest of the world; and in the discussions \nof 1921-1922 the argument was put, especially by Christian Rakovsky, \nthat exemplary tolerance should be shown by the Central Committee \ntowards the various Soviet republics so as to make Bolshevism an \nattractive alternative in the eyes of national minorities in the states \nestablished in eastern Europe since the treaty of Versailles. The introduction of American \n 196 \nLenin: A Political Life \noil companies, if it occurred, would result in the handing over of \nvirtually all large-scale Azerbaidzhani industry to the mercy of foreign \ncapitalism.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921.70 \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n197 \nThis emphasis was strengthened by the failure of the 'March Action' \nundertaken by the German Communist Party, on the initiative of Bela \nKun and other representatives of the Communist International, to \noverthrow the elected German government and seize power in the last \nweek of March 1921. By his own estimation, socialist revolution in \nGermany was a prerequisite for the full achievement of socialism in \nRussia. \n 198 \nLenin: A Political Life \nUndeterred by the dispute about Baku and Grozny oil, Lenin pushed \nfor east Ukrainian coal as a further possible concession.' The opposition, according to Lenin, \nwas supposedly motivated by 'Donbass patriotism'. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. \nYet the central party leaders were also exercised by Marxist theory; \nthe question arose about the prospects for international capitalism if \nthere might be no European socialist revolution for several years. \nAbout the inevitability of such a revolution there was no disagreement. 'Left' and 'right' were no longer easily definable terms \namong Bolsheviks.87 In future years Lenin's reticence was to \nbe exploited by official party spokesmen as an indication that he \nadvocated the long-term 'peaceful co-existence' of socialism and \ncapitalism around the world with struggle being limited to ideologi-\ncal, non-violent competition. In \naddition, Lenin's open letter of April 1921 to party comrades in the \nTranscaucasus adumbrated a policy of 'co-habitation' with the \ncapitalist West. \nThose Bolsheviks who \nthought that political as well as economic compromises should be made \nwith the major capitalist powers he regarded as madmen. 'And yet,' Lenin \nenquired ponderously at the Ninth Congress of Soviets, 'is such a thing \nat all conceivable that a socialist republic could exist in capitalist \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n201 \nencirclement. No such \nthought crossed Lenin's mind or left his lips even though he \nincreasingly behaved as if 'European socialist revolution' was not \nimmediately in prospect. Lenin's wish to \nplay off one capitalist power against another was to the fore. \nReferring to his disputes with the Left Communists, he dedicated \nover a quarter of the pamphlet to word-for-word quotations from his \n1918 pamphlet On 'Left-Wing' Infantilism and on Petit-Bourgeois \nTendencies. The premise that 'the workers and peasants' held \npower in Soviet Russia was false, but it was also an article of Bolshevik \nfaith; and Lenin maintained that the supposed reality of a government \nbased upon popular consent would ensure that state capitalism would \nnot lead to an abandonment of the socialist commitment. Picking up a term in growing use among \nBolsheviks, Lenin urged that the economics of 'War Communism' \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n203 \nshould be put aside. In \nLenin's presentation, the end to grain requisitioning would eventually \nfacilitate the inauguration of 'correct socialist product-exchange'. Quoting his \nwords from May 1918, he reiterated that the Soviet republic's society \ndisplayed a variety of stages of social and cultural development, \nstretching from patriarchal economy based on barter through to \nmodern socialist economic forms. In 1921 he proposed that even a \n'direct transition from patriarchalism to socialism' was not impossible. 104 \nLenin still wrote as a confident social engineer.'107 \nThus his deadly intolerance did not cease in 1921: the widely-\nentertained notion that Lenin conceived the New Economic policy as \ninvolving a relaxation in the social atmosphere for everyone who took \nno part in politics is badly mistaken: Lenin still breathed fire. Lenin wanted this understood from the start: \ncapitalist practices had to be accepted in post-war economic \nreconstruction. And yet he would not have been Lenin if he had not \nsimultaneously snarled at capitalism. 111 Lenin stressed that the Bolsheviks themselves had to accept \ndifferent attitudes to work if they were not to 'become bureaucratised'. Bolsheviks had to buckle down to \ntheir own education: 'We must not be scared to admit that here there is \nstill much that can and must be learned from the capitalist.'114 Lenin also \nurged his party to accept that, in the immediate future, the benefits of \n The Rifle and the Sickle \n205 \nthe New Economic Policy would accrue to the lower middle class, \nespecially to the peasants, rather than to the workers. 116 And yet Lenin was adamant: the New \nEconomic Policy was indispensable. Consequently they were a means of accelerating the \n'transition to socialism'.' 17 \nLenin insisted that victory for socialism in Russia and Europe could \nnot be thwarted forever. A foreshortening of the possible time-scale was \nconceivable only if socialist revolutions broke out beforehand in \ncountries like 'England, Germany, America'. 118 Lenin left the topic at \nthat. The \nBolsheviks were few, but they were united: 'And we know what we \nwant. Information about disquiet was \n 206 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfreely available to the central party leadership. In \nLenin's view, this was but a short step from a campaign to overturn the \nNew Economic Policy by favouring the workers at the expense of the \npeasants. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. 129 It was also noticeable that \n 208 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe parameters of the New Economic Policy had been expanded. Lenin in previous works had \ndescribed the peasantry as a feudal class in an advanced stage of \ndisintegration, under the impact of capitalist economic development, \ninto two antagonistic new classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; \nhe had also stressed in the Party Programme that the party should \nenhance the interests of the poorer and middling segments of the \npeasantry.135 Now that Lenin's own proposed ideas, theses and booklet \nwere being savaged, Larin remarked: 'At this moment, comrades, I \nwould remind comrade Lenin that writing theses is a rottenjobl' 136 His \nsubstantive contention was that the New Economic Policy should give \ngreater attention to large-scale industry and the plight of the urban \nworking class. Always the target was Lenin.142 With supporters like this, Lenin needed no opponents. The \n 210 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstrains showed in Lenin's concluding statement. It had not been a \none-man Politburo in spring 1921 . Karl Radek \nreported on 'the role of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks' \nand suggested that the Bolshevik party was being infiltrated by its \nenemies. The Socialist Revolutionaries were especially worrisome. He sat down after \ncalling for 'a merciless struggle' against both Socialist Revolutionaries \nand Mensheviks. \nHe was exercised by the possibilities of socialist revolutions in Europe. \nAlready, as he admitted, there were controversies among Politburo \nmembers as to whether the Communist International confronted a \nperiod of 'quiescence' when the capitalist economies would stabilise \nthemselves and prevent revolutionary conturbation. Bumazhny attacked Lenin. Lenin had misjudged the needs of situation: \nthe ordinary party members as wen as the Bolshevik inte11ectua1 elite \nhad to be addressed. Trouble looked as if \nit would arise when a perceptive delegate shouted out that a \ndiscrepancy existed between the respective assumptions about the \nprospects of European socialist revolution displayed by Radek and \nLenin. 162 Lenin assured the Conference that he did not intend the \nNew Economic Policy as a capitalist free-for-all. 163 \nFor the moment the Bolsheviks had to elaborate their measures on \nthe premise that the October Revolution stood alone. 181 \nLenin was vague about his general vision of the New Economic \nPolicy in the medium-term future.' 182 \nThis was the sort of rhetorical souffle which, if cooked by a \nProvisional Government minister in 1917 or a Bolshevik opositionist in \n1918-1920, Lenin would have relished puncturing. The Russian Communist Party especially prided itself as being \na party for the workers. 188 \n 218 \nLenin: A Political Life \nIf Trotski's proposal in August 1921 was that the Politburo's \nFebruary 1921 assumption should be honoured and given additional \npractical force, it was Lenin's thinking that had changed.", "Tenth_Party_Congress_1921": " Unease and irritation were expressed in \ndozens of written queries passed up to Lenin at the Tenth Party \nCongress. The revolt of the Kronstadt \nsailors during the Tenth Party Congress prevented the irritation from \nbeing manifested in too unruly a fashion; the incentive to ratty around \nthe Central Committee was irresistible. A Central Committee plenum \nmet on the Congress's last day, and appointed the new Politburo. The central \nparty apparatus had scrutinised and sanctioned the details.20 Lenin, a more than willing public speaker in normal times, \ndelivered only four speeches in the ten weeks after the Party Congress. \nCONQUEST OF EMPIRE \nAt the Tenth Party Congress and subsequently Lenin had demanded a \nunion between workers and peasants.30 He \ncould not say this at the Congress without casting a shadow on the \nparty's claim to be defending the interests of the mass of the \n 190 \nLenin: A Political Life \npopulation.33 The ruthlessness anticipated by Lenin at the Tenth \nParty Congress was repeatedly requested. 39 Almost certainly the temporising was caused by \ndisagreements among central party leaders.44 Stalin himself had been criticised for this at the \nTenth Party Congress.48 The rest of the central \nparty leadership, too, wanted to hold the republics of the Transcau-\ncasus to heel. In August 1921 this became the \nofficial policy of the party's Kavburo.69 Nor did he give up the hope that \n'world revolution' would come to the rescue of the RSFSR and the \nallied Soviet republics; indeed no assertion of this possibility was made \nby him between the Tenth Party Congress and the end of 1921. A furious \ndiscussion took place at the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions in \nMay 1921, and Lenin was obliged to attend to justify concessions. His \npamphlet On The Food Tax and his subsequent speeches to the Tenth \nParty Conference, in May 1921, concentrated on domestic economics \nand politics at the expense of the international situation except insofar \nas he mentioned concessionaires. 109 No \nquarter should be given to these parties. Zaslavski was still reporting late into the summer that \nthe fellow party members under his control hated the reform ratified at \nthe Tenth Party Congress. 123 But a technical problem had \nexisted for Lenin: namely that the Congress resolution on party unity \nlaid down no procedure for expelling a Central Committee member. The Tenth Party Congress had given its approval; but, \non drawing second breath, probably most party leaders and activists in \nthe localities felt that the basic arguments had been given insufficient \nventilation. The Party \nCongress had been an important and gigantic advance in this direction; \nbut the goal had not been reached. Two months after the Party Congress \nit was determined to hold a Party Conference. The \nperformance at the Party Congress had to be repeated at the Party \nConference. 126 239 delegates assembled \nin the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin on 26 May 1921 to hear their \nleadership's account of themselves. 138 Central \nCommittee member V. \nBetween the Congress and the Conference it convened a dozen times.'170 \nThe widespread gossip about the Tenth Party Conference showed \nthat antagonism to the New Economic Policy, while being too \nineffectual to change it, remained strong.' 173 The Eleventh Party Conference returned to such \nmatters in December 1921. The New \nEconomic Policy, as it had evolved after the Tenth Party Congress, had \ninvolved the abolition of important aspects of the state's authority to \nintervene in the operation of industry, agriculture and trade. \nThe other central public institutions were subordinate to the party \napparatus.8 \nHow many lost their party cards through membership of the \nWorkers' Opposition is not yet known. The \n'trade union discussion' and the Tomski affair were in their minds, and \nthe Tenth Party Conference had left them edgy about the situation in \nthe party as a whole.40 This was in \nApril 1921.46 \nLenin, burdened by the Soviet domestic political agenda, took three \nmonths after the Tenth Party Congress before inserting himself into the \naffairs of European communism. \nThe Congress followed the pre-ordained line. There had been no Congress \nlike it; not even at the Tenth Party Congress had he been absent so \npersistently. To the Congress's surprise, he \nproceeded to justify the open letter written by Paul Levi calling for a \npolitical alliance of all the parties of German socialism in January 1921 \n(even though Lenin still refrained from seeking Levi's re-instatement in \nthe Communist Party of Germany). His \narguments for the New Economic Policy as delivered to the Tenth \nParty Conference in May 1921 were replicated with confidence. This struck a chord \nwith the Congress. Zinoviev presented the leadership's conclu-\nsions to the Twelfth Party Conference in August 1922 (while Lenin was \nrecuperating from a stroke). He had declared to the \nNinth Congress of Soviets, in the last week of 1921, that the terror had \nbeen crucial to victory in the Civil War. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. \nTHE ELEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS \nPolitburo members and the rest of the Central Committee wanted no \ninterference and no upsets. The party was to be presented with \ndecisions and consulted only minimally; the first year of the New \nEconomic Policy, coming after the disputes of 1920-1921, had been a \nbattering experience. Lenin considered it vital that a united front \nshould be formed by the Central Committee, and had exerted himself \n Against the Wall \n249 \nto this end despite ill-health as preparations were made for the opening \nof the Eleventh Party Congress in Moscow on 27 March 1922. Party unity and loyalty to the line of the Central \nCommittee were the objective. Now we must say in the name of the party: enough.211 The Central Committee was not given an easy time. At session six, he explained that his \narguments for the strict subordination of the trade unions to the state \nin the controversy before the Tenth Party Congress was a corollary to \nhis failure to persuade the Central Committee to drop grain \nrequisitioning in February 1920. They had detonated themselves in a fairly controlled fashion \nat the Party Conferences in 1921, and it was only a stroke of luck that \ndiscouraged them from going further at the Eleventh Congress.", "Enlistment_Of_Hundreds_1918": " 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. 35 It was an event quite \nas historic as the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918. They were \narmed, and their purpose was to join the Allies on the Western front in \nthe Great War.44 The idea \nwas as audacious as it was ill-considered, overlooking the utter \nunpreparedness of the Red Army to resist German armed forces.75 The Red \nArmy was not yet formed.81 What shattered the possibility of this \nvestigial manoeuvring between the Germans and the British was the \nCzech Legion's revolt on 25 May 1918. 123 Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, \nRuthenes and even Germans and Poles were looked upon as potential \nenlisters. 124 The problems of recruitment are readily comprehensible. \nThe decree of 22 January 1918 establishing the Red Army was expected \nto result in the enlistment of hundreds of thousands of Russians.", "Requisitioning_Campaign_1918": " Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. 35 It was an event quite \nas historic as the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. The Third Congress of Soviets in January 1918 had also called \nfor the drafting of a Constitution; but nothing followed quickly.", "Bolshevik_Leader_1918": " 1 Merciless Retreat \n'THE CURRENT TASKS OF SOVIET POWER' \nLenin was a mercurial mixture as a political leader. The changes made by the Bolsheviks in \ntheir policies after the October Revolution of 1917 were drastic. The \nBolsheviks had also expected to rule a multinational state with the \nsupport of the non-Russian nationalities. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. Public \nopinion had been prepared by Bolshevik propaganda, insofar as such \npropaganda had any effect, for a revolutionary process unmarred by \nproblems. Officers in their thousands \nfrom the demobilised Imperial Army were assembling in southern \nRussia and in mid-Siberia; their objective was the overthrow of Lenin's \nregime. \nSovnarkom, as Lenin's government was known, had survived for a \nnumber of reasons. His Decree on Land gave him credit with the \npeasants, and the Bolsheviks at least did well among the working class \nand garrison soldiers in the Constituent Assembly elections. The \nexhausting conditions of everyday life also worked in the Bolshevik \nparty's favour. Yet the Bolsheviks could not afford to be \ncomplacent. Lenin had not lost his faith in the inevitability of \ncommunism's global triumph; but he recognised the weaknesses of \nthe party's position. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Every leading Bolshevik appreciated \nthe acuteness of the regime's crisis. None forgot the \nabruptness of the emperor Nikolai II's forced abdication in February \n1917 or minister-president Aleksandr Kerenski's flight from the Winter \nPalace in October. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nNo Bolshevik leader was in greater danger than Lenin. About his likely \nfate in the event of the Bolshevik party's overthrow there could be little \ndoubt. Aside from such \nblack propaganda, however, Lenin was undeniably more responsible \nthan any fellow Bolshevik for the actions of his party. But Lenin \nhad to live with the consequences and was in no mood to regret or \napologise. Lenin's political friends were sorely in need of guidance. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Nor was \nhis own Bolshevik party quiescent. Lenin's proposals \ntook the form of a lengthy pamphlet written in the second fortnight of \n1918. Pamphleteering was his most congenial medium of communica-\ntion with fellow Bolsheviks except for speeches to their Congresses. But Lenin was an experienced journalist and \ncould write fast and, when he set his mind to it, forcefully. The result \nwas The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Lenin avoided reference to \nopponents in the Bolshevik party and mentioned the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries only fleetingly. The Brest-Litovsk treaty, that momentous treaty \nwhich had ended hostilities on the Eastern front in the Great War, was \n 4 \nLenin: A Political Life \nscarcely cited. \nHe was astonishingly casual about armed resistance to the \nBolsheviks. Possibly his dismissal of the potential military threat was a \nmere device to fix Bolshevik eyes on the politics and the economy. Lenin seldom failed to bang the war-drum when \nalarmed about the future. Residing in the \nKremlin in Moscw and hearing about events elsewhere in Russia only \nintermittently, Lenin simply blundered.4 The party's priority, according to Lenin, should be the \nintroduction of strict account-keeping and control. Lenin's basic aim was less to create an atmosphere of \nliberation than to get labourers, skilled and unskilled, to raise their \nlevel of discipline and productivity.6 He was blunt: 'The Russian \nworker is a bad worker in comparison with the advanced nations. In Lenin's estimation, the \noccurrence of the October Revolution made Taylor's techniques \ndeployable without damage to the working class's interests. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished.' \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOPPOSITION AND SURVIVAL \nThe resistance was beginning to cause panic. It would be an \nexaggerated claim that, had Lenin cracked under the strain, the \nBolsheviks would have gone under. 15 The fervid atmosphere seemed to \nleave Lenin cool.' 16 The capacity to close off his mind to distractions was \naccompanied by an ability to impart his confidence to the rest of the \nBolshevik central leadership. According to Trotski, Lenin had the \nadvantage of obviously 'believing in that which he said' .17 \nEven the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who wanted to see the treaty \nof Brest-Litovsk torn up, did not envisage Lenin's permanent removal \nfrom the chairmanship of Sovnarkom. Karl Radek, a Bolshevik \nopponent of the treaty, was approached by the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Pavel Proshyan at a meeting of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets with the question: \n'Wouldn't it be simpler to arrest Lenin for a day, declare war on the \nGermans and then wholeheartedly elect comrade Lenin again as \nSovnarkom chairman.' 18 The matter was not just personal (although a \nrecognition of Lenin's exceptional qualities as a leader was involved). \nThe Left Communists and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also judged \nthat any split with Lenin would cause a destructive narrowing of the \npolitical base of the October Revolution. The Urals Regional \nCommittee and the Moscow Regional Committee, as well as the \nTaganrog Conference of Bolsheviks fleeing from Ukraine in the path of \nthe German military occupation, were vehemently hostile to Brest-\nLitovsk and all it stood for. 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees. The Moscow \nRegional Committee was their first and most important victim.21 \n Merciless Retreat \n7 \nAt the same time Lenin no more wanted to lose the Left Communists \nthan they him.22 Lenin saw that the Bolsheviks \nwere too few to be able to dispense with a faction's assistance; but the \nwords of the decision reflect also his condescension to the Left \nCommunists as being given to light-headed abstractions in their \nthinking. They were centralisers to an even higher \ndegree than Lenin. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. Bukharin had \nalready produced a pamphlet entitled The Programme of the \nCommunists (Bolsheviks). 23 Despite being schematic and full of \njargon, the writings of this left-wing Bolshevik troika appealed to \nmany, perhaps even most, long-standing party activists. Lenin \nconsequently had reason to fear Bukharin's return to the fold. They were still more utopian and incoherent than Lenin;24 but \nin practice, like him, they tended to support centralist force against \nlocally-established collective endeavours whenever they had to make a \nchoice. Lenin saw this as he \ntackled the shortages of food supplies in Russian cities in April and \nMay 1918.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. Lenin recommended \na minimum of ten years' forced labour and permanent expulsion from \nthe village commune in any case of hoarding. On 9 May a further discussion took place and Lenin's \namendment was rejected. Lenin kept up the pressure.30 Lenin's blood was up. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. But Bolsheviks of all persuasions hardly \ncared. Lenin and his opponents in his own party \nhad found common cause once more, and were relieved that they could \nwork together again. 31 \n Merciless Retreat \n9 \nNot only Lenin but also his colleagues were recklessly narrowing the \npolitical base of their regime. Their alienation of the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Party was accompanied by persecution of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. Bolsheviks were made \nanxious by the rise in working-class antipathy to themselves. The discontent \nwas simply transferred to other arenas: anti-Bolshevik sentiment found \nexpression in the growing popularity of the movement for an Assembly \nof Plenipotentiaries among Petrograd workers. Strikes broke out in \nnorthern Russia, and an improvised demonstration at Kolpino on 9 \nMay was fired upon by troops loyal to the Bolsheviks. The Putilov Works, which in 1917 had \nprominently supported the Bolshevik political advance, came out in \nsympathy with the Kolpino demonstrators. 32 But Lenin was in no \nmood to yield. Lenin was pre-occupied by the diplomatic \nand military crisis rather than rendered cowardly by the prospect of \njustifying his policies to the Central Executive Committee. Five days later, on 14 \nMay, Lenin returned to the political fray and castigated the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with ferocity. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries continued to \nparticipate fitfully in public affairs over the ensuing three years, but \nalways on Bolshevik terms. That Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik Central Committee \nshould have rushed so fast to impose such a dictatorship is evidence of \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir extraordinary confidence that, despite the terrific reverses \nendured by them at home and abroad since October 1917, history \nwas on their side. Lenin was extremely \ndull about anticipating the scale and timing of outbreaks of civil war. He made \nno effort to smooth relations between the Legion and the Bolshevik-led \nsoviets of the towns they passed through along the railway line.39 \nWhere Trotski lurched, Lenin followed. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. Lenin received an appeal for assistance \nfrom the Penza Bolshevik leader Minkin.42 \nEMERGENCY IN MOSCOW \nThe Czechoslovaks had had no intention of overthrowing Sovnarkom; \nbut on arrival in Samara they were besought by the Socialist \nRevolutionaries, whose leaders had fled there after the dissolution of \nthe Constituent Assembly, to fight on behalf of Komuch. Komuch asserted that it had the most legitimate claim to \nrule the country, and called for the overthrow of the Bolshevik party \ndictatorship. A half-day's train \njourney separated them from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and \nLenin. \nUnless a Red Army could quickly and effectively be moved into action, \nthe Bolshevik leadership would be caught in Moscow and overthrown. \nNonetheless it still appeared to the Central Committee under Lenin \nthat political retreat and reconciliation would endanger the regime to a \ngreater extent than pursuit of the existing policies. Lenin also \nrefused to be intimidated by the resumption of assassinations as a tactic \nby the Socialist Revolutionaries. Moscow became unsafe for the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee even though the Czechoslovaks had not yet moved from \nthe river Volga. \nSuch doubts as Lenin entertained he did not express. Martov was the \nworld's greatest Lenin-watcher, and claimed to be able to detect a \nmuffled uncertainty in his speeches in mid-1918. Supposedly Lenin was \nquestioning whether the Brest-Litovsk treaty had really been worth \nsigning. His arguments against Bukharin and the Left Communists, \naccording to Martov, were essentially a means of persuading himself as \nmuch as the Left Communists: 'The nub of the matter here is not a \nstruggle of citizen Lenin with some group standing to his left, but \nrather an inner struggle of the two souls which constitute contempor-\nary Bolshevism. '43 \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMartov, for once in his life, underestimated Lenin's determination. \nPossibly the Bolshevik leader may have been wondering whether the \nbenefits of the treaty were as great as he had originally supposed; but \nnot for a moment did he deny that the signature of a separate peace \nwith Germany and Austria-Hungary was a better option than any \nconceivable alternative. Lenin \nwaited on events, and did not have to wait long. On 24 June the Central \nCommittee of the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries met secretly \nto approve the assassination of German diplomats in Moscow. The Left Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leaders hoped that this would lead to a rapprochement of their \nparty and the Bolsheviks in the cause of revolutionary war. \nIntimations of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary conspiracy reached the \nears of Felix Dzierzynski, Bolshevik chairman of the Cheka, on 28 \nJune. Yet victory for the Bolsheviks was already guaranteed by \ntheir majority over the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of voting places. Lenin had no \n Merciless Retreat \n13 \nhesitation. Blyumkin's murderous action gave the Bolsheviks a \nchance to behave as if reacting to an outrage rather than merely \npersecuting fellow socialists. Lenin had it in mind to arrest \nand execute a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee. Disposi-\ntions were made for the detention of Left Socialist-Revolutionary \ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets in the Bolshoi Theatre. Lenin was realistically contemptuous about the \npotential strength of the armed resistance to his forces. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. 50 \nLenin acted speedily for two reasons. The sole advantage to \nBerlin in retaining the Bolsheviks in power was their adherence to \nBrest-Litovsk. Without this, Lenin would be useless to the Germans. 51 \nLenin carried out the mission with distaste.'52 On arrival at the embassy, Lenin carried out the necessary \nformalities.53 \nLenin was glad to leave the embassy a few minutes later. \nUntil then they had neither revolted nor intended to break permanently \nwith the Bolsheviks; their strategy of assassination displayed an \ninfantile standard of calculation, but they had genuinely meant no \nharm to the Bolshevik party. To their horror they saw that the \nBolsheviks aimed at their suppression. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \nLenin resumed practical control. Vacietis's \nsupport was crucial in view of the military weakness of the Bolsheviks \nin Moscow; and the deployment of the Red Army to the Volga region \ncramped the possibilities of reinforcement from elsewhere.57 Yet he may also have begun to understand that the \nbalance of forces, ill-trained as most of them were on both sides, might \nsuddenly change to the disadvantage of the Bolsheviks.59 Yet \nTrotski can hardly have been high in Lenin's esteem at the time. The \npreservation of 'Soviet power' depended entirely upon the loyalty and \nefficiency of a Latvian officer who was neither a Bolshevik nor a \nproven military officer. \nFortunately for Lenin, Vacietis completed his task splendidly.61 An uprising of Left Socialist-Revolution-\naries had also been started in Yaroslavl, a town to Moscow's north \neast, on 6 July, but was suppressed a fortnight later. The former \ncoalition partners of the Bolsheviks went down to defeat; almost \nwithout noticing it, Lenin and the core of Bolshevik Central Committee \nmembers had passed over the threshold from a two-party revolutionary \ndictatorship into an outright dictatorship by one party. \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMANOEUVRE, RETREAT, WAIT \nLenin knew that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk depended entirely on the \nGerman government's intentions, and that these in turn were shaped \nby success or failure for German forces on the Western front. \nLenin did not lie supine in the meantime.63 The Bolsheviks deferred to Bertin; their \nforces were pathetically incompetent to resist. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement.'65 But what did Lenin say to \nthose who claimed that, since Brest-Litovsk, he had no independent \npolicy.67 \nPlaying one capitalist power against another was, Lenin urged, the sole \noption available in the circumstances. Lenin's political survival depended on Allied military \nsuccess in the West at least until such time as the long-expected \nrevolution should break out in Berlin. Every political party in Russia regarded the \nBolsheviks as traitors. \nNot even Lenin wished to give public display of such submissiveness. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism. It appears to \nhave staggered Sokolnikov, who until then had been Lenin's supporter, \nthat the Germans had chosen and been able to rule Ukraine through \nlocal stooges. Lenin's high-risk strategy did not go unperceived \nas such. Lenin was especially keen \nto secure backing from Trotski, who had been on the left side in the \nBrest-Litovsk controversy.79 Trotski and Zinoviev \nbacked Lenin.80 His \nsupport for Lenin disproved this. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were \nrecognised in Berlin as godless and anti-monarchical. But Bolshevism \nwas allowed to stay in power because it represented the sole Russian \nparty which would adhere to the Brest-Litovsk treaty; and, unless the \nRed Army could reassure Berlin about its capacity to resist insurrection \non Russian soil, the Bolshevik party would have been cast down by \n Merciless Retreat \n19 \nLudendorff. On 10 June, \nLenin rebuked the Bolsheviks in Kuban for mounting an attack on \nGerman troops in Taganrog, and similar instructions were issued two \ndays later to Red Army and Bolshevik party personnel on the Southern \nfront: no military engagement with the Germans was permissible. 84 Lenin not only wanted to exhibit enthusiasm for \nBrest-Litovsk; he also increasingly wished to enlist the Germans in \ndefence of Soviet-held territory against further landings by the Allies. This information was as yet unavailable \nto Lenin. Yet Lenin anyway \nconsidered he had little choice. Consequently Lenin was even willing on 13 \nAugust to risk inviting the Germans, through Chicherin, to bomb \nArkhangelsk on Sovnarkom's behalf. A new era in the Soviet republic's relations with the governments \nand peoples of the rest of the world was heralded. Lenin had misled himself. But \nBrest-Litovsk had at least ensured the sheer survival of the Bolsheviks \nin power. It was an achievement of Lenin's gamble in international \nrelations. \nTHE WRITING OF A CONSTITUTION \nLenin scoffed at constitutionalism in politics. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above. The \nBrest-Litovsk dispute pre-occupied the minds of both the Bolsheviks \nand the Left SRs. Not until 30 March did the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee approve a proposal for the All-Russian Central Executive \nCommittee of the Congress of Soviets to set up a drafting \ncommission.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Sverdlov was commission chairman, and \nStalin was included as the Bolshevik official expert on the question of \nthe nationalities.90 Notable by his absence was Lenin. \nThe federal basis of the forthcoming Constitution had been \nestablished, on Lenin's recommendation, at the Third Congress of \n Merciless Retreat \n21 \nSoviets in January 1918.93 Sovnarkom at present \nruled only Russia- and not all Russia at that.96 The contrast with Lenin was \nimpressive. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress. Even so, Stalin was tossing aside the \nargument that Russians would be politically unwelcome in those parts \nof the Russian Empire unless the Bolshevik party went out of its way to \ndisclaim territorial acquisitiveness.98 Yet Lenin was \nso unexercised by the constitutional question that he did nothing until \nSverdlov's commission reported back to the Central Committee.99 \nStalin was in any case closer to Lenin's viewpoint than were other \ncommission members. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. The Left Socialist-Revolutionary went further: 'Comrade \nStalin has got so accustomed to such a situation that he has perfectly \nassimilated even the jargon of imperialism. This booklet, which had recently been published but \nhad been written in mid-1917, envisaged a revolutionary order with \nmuch greater scope for popular initiative than Lenin was willing to \ntolerate by 1918. All he could \nsay in reply was: 'Mention has been made here of comrade Lenin. I \nwould permit myself to remark that Lenin, so far as I know - and I \nknow very well -, has said that this project is worthless.' 103 Some \nBolshevik members remained unhappy with his performance. The need \nfor any reference to national issues rankled so much that Pokrovski, a \nBolshevik, preferred Reisner's draft. But Stalin got his way . Lenin and \nStalin in 1917 had taken pains to get the slogan of national self-\ndetermination accepted in the Bolshevik party, and were convinced \nthat its deployment would help the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Lenin began to take an interest from a \ndistance. His main ambition for the Constitution was for it to rouse \nworkers and peasants to support the Bolsheviks. Instead he \nsubstituted a text already accepted at the Third Congress of Soviets, \nnamely 'The Declaration of Rights of the Labouring and Exploited \nPeople' submitted by Lenin to the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.105 \nSverdlov, understandably miffed, behaved like a disciplined \nBolshevik and induced the commission to comply on 17 June. 106 The \nBolshevik Central Committee, looking at the result nine days later, was \nunimpressed. Lenin even threatened to remove the Constitution from \nthe agenda of the forthcoming Congress of Soviets. 107 Sverdlov, who \nhad many other duties to fulfil at the same time, felt unappreciated by \nhis party leader. 109 Its final draft was \nperused by the Central Committee, in the presence of Lenin and \nTrotski, on 3 July. A last effort at polishing the style, but not the contents, was \nentrusted to Yuri Steklov; and it was Steklov, a leading ex-Menshevik \nwriter and editor, who was instructed to present the draft Constitution \nto the Fifth Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918. Nevertheless the \nBolshevik Central Committee did not introduce further amendments \nafter being released from the need to conciliate the party's coalition \npartners. Lenin did not even bother to speak at the Congress of \nSoviets session. \nAlready there was more flim-flam than substance in the Bolshevik \nparty's commitment to creating a federation. But the Bolshevik party leadership cynically hoped to \nattract the support of non-Russian peoples by showing off federalism \nas a slogan. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power. Yet \nLenin did not intend to agitate himself and his comrades over a \nquestion of Marxism which since 1917 had been dear to him. 118 The same section implicitly \ncleared the ground for the Bolsheviks to outlaw any political parties, \norganisations or newspapers. Vladimir Lenin would only \nbother with constitutional trifles when his current political purposes \nwere threatened. Trotski, Dzierzynski and Lenin \nconfronted a near-disastrous military situation. \nThe Bolshevik leaders had also seen the uses of the prisoners-of-war \ntaken by Russian armies in 1914-1917, especially those from the lands \nof the Hapsburg monarchy (and the Constitution itself had been \nformulated so as to grant citizenship to all foreigners working in Russia \nor fighting in the Red Army). \nThe decree of 22 January 1918 establishing the Red Army was expected \nto result in the enlistment of hundreds of thousands of Russians. But \nfew Russians were willing to fight. Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. 126 \nTrotski's efforts were intensified when the Czechoslovak Legion, on \nentering into Samara, put itself at the disposal of the Komuch \ngovernment of Socialist Revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the \nBolsheviks in Moscow. \nBonch-Bruevich (who, despite his anti-socialist convictions, was \nbrother to Lenin's personal assistant Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich). Sviyazhsk was \nheld and the Reds marched upon Kazan. Lenin stayed in Moscow in \nAugust. The \nfollowing note was dispatched to Trotski from Lenin: 'I'm sure that the \nsuppression of the Czechs and White Guards, as well as the \nbloodsucking kulaks who support them, will be a model of \nmercilessness.' 130 \n Merciless Retreat \n27 \nIf Lenin harboured a suspicion that Trotski might wage war in too \nsensitive a spirit, he had misjudged him. This \nprovoked outrage in the Bolshevik party. Rozengolts headed the court martial, was unrepentant \nand sought Lenin's support on 23 October. Its commander was Mikhail Tukhachevski. This was Lenin's birthplace. Lenin failed to understand the \ngeographical limitations of the Red victory. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards. \nLenin was not the sole Bolshevik to exult, and Pravda editorials were \nunderstandably keen to emphasise the successes in battle. Yet the \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncentral party leaders, both in the Kremlin and by the Volga, had little \nknowledge about other Russian forces being formed to attack the \nReds. Denikin, after the death of Lavr Kornilov in action in \nApril 1918, had taken over the armed units of anti-Bolshevism in \nsouthern Russia. From three sides of the compass \nthere was a threat to the existence of the Bolshevik party and the Soviet \ngovernment. Yet Lenin referred to none of them in his telegrams in \n1918.", "Kow-Tow_To_Kaiser_1918": " W. Moscow's policy was \nmerely to kow-tow to Kaiser Wilhelm. Komuch was no more.", "Socialism_1918": " \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The pamphlet \nsuggested that 'any great revolution, and especially a socialist one' was \ninconceivable without such a war. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. \nThis meant that their alliance with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries \nover the Brest-Litovsk treaty could not last.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. If matters had come to a total break with the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries, so be it. This would necessarily involve an assault on the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. First, he wanted to catch the \nLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries unawares. The Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries perceived what fate lay in store for them. With nothing left to lose, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries resolved to take control of key points in the capital. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism. The two treaties with \nthe Germans had not really brought about a 'breathing-space' for the \ndevelopment of socialism at home. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress. The plan to win support for \nsocialism elsewhere in Europe by pointing to Sovnarkom's anti-\nimperialist commitment was also being undermined. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. The Left Socialist-Revolutionary went further: 'Comrade \nStalin has got so accustomed to such a situation that he has perfectly \nassimilated even the jargon of imperialism.' 11 By then the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionary revolt had been suppressed. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power. Lenin had argued at length in his recently-published State and \nRevolution that socialism would be an entirely distinct phase of history \nbetween capitalism and communism.' 116 The disenfranchisement of the middle and \nupper classes was phrased as follows: 'In the general interest of the \nworking class the RSFSR deprives individuals or particular groups of \nany privileges which may be used by them to the detriment of the \nsocialist revolution. Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards.", "Possibility_1918": " 35 It was an event quite \nas historic as the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.", "Comrade_Lenin_1918": " 1 Merciless Retreat \n'THE CURRENT TASKS OF SOVIET POWER' \nLenin was a mercurial mixture as a political leader. \nLenin, unlike Muhammed and Cromwell, made a virtue out of \nchangeability. The changes made by the Bolsheviks in \ntheir policies after the October Revolution of 1917 were drastic. \n 2 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAnd Lenin and his comrades had promised peace across Europe. Public \nopinion had been prepared by Bolshevik propaganda, insofar as such \npropaganda had any effect, for a revolutionary process unmarred by \nproblems. \nSovnarkom, as Lenin's government was known, had survived for a \nnumber of reasons. The \nexhausting conditions of everyday life also worked in the Bolshevik \nparty's favour. Yet the Bolsheviks could not afford to be \ncomplacent. Lenin had not lost his faith in the inevitability of \ncommunism's global triumph; but he recognised the weaknesses of \nthe party's position. A \nrising number of workers turned against the Bolsheviks. Every leading Bolshevik appreciated \nthe acuteness of the regime's crisis. Spring 1918 had left the outcome of the Bolshevik \nparty's revolutionary project undetermined. \nNo Bolshevik leader was in greater danger than Lenin. About his likely \nfate in the event of the Bolshevik party's overthrow there could be little \ndoubt. Aside from such \nblack propaganda, however, Lenin was undeniably more responsible \nthan any fellow Bolshevik for the actions of his party. But Lenin \nhad to live with the consequences and was in no mood to regret or \napologise. Lenin's political friends were sorely in need of guidance. The \nParty of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, which was the junior partner in \nthe Soviet government, rejected the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Nor was \nhis own Bolshevik party quiescent. Lenin's proposals \ntook the form of a lengthy pamphlet written in the second fortnight of \n1918. Pamphleteering was his most congenial medium of communica-\ntion with fellow Bolsheviks except for speeches to their Congresses. But Lenin was an experienced journalist and \ncould write fast and, when he set his mind to it, forcefully. The result \nwas The Current Tasks of Soviet Power. Lenin avoided reference to \nopponents in the Bolshevik party and mentioned the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries only fleetingly. The Brest-Litovsk treaty, that momentous treaty \nwhich had ended hostilities on the Eastern front in the Great War, was \n 4 \nLenin: A Political Life \nscarcely cited. \nHe was astonishingly casual about armed resistance to the \nBolsheviks. Lenin seldom failed to bang the war-drum when \nalarmed about the future. Residing in the \nKremlin in Moscw and hearing about events elsewhere in Russia only \nintermittently, Lenin simply blundered. The pamphlet \nsuggested that 'any great revolution, and especially a socialist one' was \ninconceivable without such a war.4 The party's priority, according to Lenin, should be the \nintroduction of strict account-keeping and control. Lenin's basic aim was less to create an atmosphere of \nliberation than to get labourers, skilled and unskilled, to raise their \nlevel of discipline and productivity. In Lenin's estimation, the \noccurrence of the October Revolution made Taylor's techniques \ndeployable without damage to the working class's interests. 10 \nLenin admitted that all this constituted a 'compromise', even a \n'retreat' from unbridled revolutionary optimism. The Lenin who in 1917 had \npublicly claimed that 'the transition to socialism' would be accom-\nplishable without undue difficulty had vanished. 'But our \nrevolutionary courts and our popular courts,' lamented Lenin, 'are \nexceedingly, incredibly weak. 14 What he declared would not commend itself to all party \ncomrades.' \n 6 \nLenin: A Political Life \nOPPOSITION AND SURVIVAL \nThe resistance was beginning to cause panic. It would be an \nexaggerated claim that, had Lenin cracked under the strain, the \nBolsheviks would have gone under. 15 The fervid atmosphere seemed to \nleave Lenin cool.' 16 The capacity to close off his mind to distractions was \naccompanied by an ability to impart his confidence to the rest of the \nBolshevik central leadership. According to Trotski, Lenin had the \nadvantage of obviously 'believing in that which he said' .17 \nEven the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who wanted to see the treaty \nof Brest-Litovsk torn up, did not envisage Lenin's permanent removal \nfrom the chairmanship of Sovnarkom. Karl Radek, a Bolshevik \nopponent of the treaty, was approached by the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary Pavel Proshyan at a meeting of the All-Russian Central \nExecutive Committee of the Congress of Soviets with the question: \n'Wouldn't it be simpler to arrest Lenin for a day, declare war on the \nGermans and then wholeheartedly elect comrade Lenin again as \nSovnarkom chairman.' 18 The matter was not just personal (although a \nrecognition of Lenin's exceptional qualities as a leader was involved). \nThe Left Communists and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also judged \nthat any split with Lenin would cause a destructive narrowing of the \npolitical base of the October Revolution. The Urals Regional \nCommittee and the Moscow Regional Committee, as well as the \nTaganrog Conference of Bolsheviks fleeing from Ukraine in the path of \nthe German military occupation, were vehemently hostile to Brest-\nLitovsk and all it stood for. 19 The problem for them was that they \ncould not get many ordinary rank-and-file Bolshevik party members to \njoin armed units willing to take on the Germans. Moreover, Sverdlov and Lenin determined on an \norganisational decapitation of the Left Communists by means of the \ndisbandment of the several regional committees.21 \n Merciless Retreat \n7 \nAt the same time Lenin no more wanted to lose the Left Communists \nthan they him.22 Lenin saw that the Bolsheviks \nwere too few to be able to dispense with a faction's assistance; but the \nwords of the decision reflect also his condescension to the Left \nCommunists as being given to light-headed abstractions in their \nthinking. They were centralisers to an even higher \ndegree than Lenin. In agriculture they wanted a more rapid movement \ntowards collective farming; and they argued that the Bolshevik party, \nhaving seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of \nthe working class, should reject Lenin's call for 'state capitalism'. Bukharin had \nalready produced a pamphlet entitled The Programme of the \nCommunists (Bolsheviks). 23 Despite being schematic and full of \njargon, the writings of this left-wing Bolshevik troika appealed to \nmany, perhaps even most, long-standing party activists. They were still more utopian and incoherent than Lenin;24 but \nin practice, like him, they tended to support centralist force against \nlocally-established collective endeavours whenever they had to make a \nchoice. \nThis meant that their alliance with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries \nover the Brest-Litovsk treaty could not last.25 Here was a cause that \nbound the Left Communists and Lenin back together against the Left \nSocialist Revolutionaries. Lenin recommended \na minimum of ten years' forced labour and permanent expulsion from \nthe village commune in any case of hoarding. On 9 May a further discussion took place and Lenin's \namendment was rejected. Lenin kept up the pressure.30 Lenin's blood was up. \nThe requisitioning campaign predictably infuriated the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. But Bolsheviks of all persuasions hardly \ncared. If matters had come to a total break with the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries, so be it. Lenin and his opponents in his own party \nhad found common cause once more, and were relieved that they could \nwork together again. 31 \n Merciless Retreat \n9 \nNot only Lenin but also his colleagues were recklessly narrowing the \npolitical base of their regime. Bolsheviks were made \nanxious by the rise in working-class antipathy to themselves. The discontent \nwas simply transferred to other arenas: anti-Bolshevik sentiment found \nexpression in the growing popularity of the movement for an Assembly \nof Plenipotentiaries among Petrograd workers. The Putilov Works, which in 1917 had \nprominently supported the Bolshevik political advance, came out in \nsympathy with the Kolpino demonstrators. 32 But Lenin was in no \nmood to yield. Lenin was pre-occupied by the diplomatic \nand military crisis rather than rendered cowardly by the prospect of \njustifying his policies to the Central Executive Committee. Five days later, on 14 \nMay, Lenin returned to the political fray and castigated the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with ferocity. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries continued to \nparticipate fitfully in public affairs over the ensuing three years, but \nalways on Bolshevik terms. That Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik Central Committee \nshould have rushed so fast to impose such a dictatorship is evidence of \n 10 \nLenin: A Political Life \ntheir extraordinary confidence that, despite the terrific reverses \nendured by them at home and abroad since October 1917, history \nwas on their side. Lenin was extremely \ndull about anticipating the scale and timing of outbreaks of civil war.39 \nWhere Trotski lurched, Lenin followed. Despite the Legion's revolt, \nit was on 26 May that Lenin proposed to Sovnarkom that Trotski's \nRed Army should be diverted to the grain-requisitioning campaign. Lenin received an appeal for assistance \nfrom the Penza Bolshevik leader Minkin.41 Lenin and Trotski \nwere digging a hole for themselves, but refused to stop digging. \nNonetheless it still appeared to the Central Committee under Lenin \nthat political retreat and reconciliation would endanger the regime to a \ngreater extent than pursuit of the existing policies. Lenin also \nrefused to be intimidated by the resumption of assassinations as a tactic \nby the Socialist Revolutionaries. \nSuch doubts as Lenin entertained he did not express. Martov was the \nworld's greatest Lenin-watcher, and claimed to be able to detect a \nmuffled uncertainty in his speeches in mid-1918. Supposedly Lenin was \nquestioning whether the Brest-Litovsk treaty had really been worth \nsigning. His arguments against Bukharin and the Left Communists, \naccording to Martov, were essentially a means of persuading himself as \nmuch as the Left Communists: 'The nub of the matter here is not a \nstruggle of citizen Lenin with some group standing to his left, but \nrather an inner struggle of the two souls which constitute contempor-\nary Bolshevism. '43 \n 12 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMartov, for once in his life, underestimated Lenin's determination. This would necessarily involve an assault on the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries. Lenin \nwaited on events, and did not have to wait long. On 24 June the Central \nCommittee of the Party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries met secretly \nto approve the assassination of German diplomats in Moscow. The Left Socialist-Revolu-\ntionary leaders hoped that this would lead to a rapprochement of their \nparty and the Bolsheviks in the cause of revolutionary war. \nIntimations of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary conspiracy reached the \nears of Felix Dzierzynski, Bolshevik chairman of the Cheka, on 28 \nJune. Yet victory for the Bolsheviks was already guaranteed by \ntheir majority over the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of voting places. Lenin had no \n Merciless Retreat \n13 \nhesitation. Blyumkin's murderous action gave the Bolsheviks a \nchance to behave as if reacting to an outrage rather than merely \npersecuting fellow socialists. Lenin had it in mind to arrest \nand execute a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee. Disposi-\ntions were made for the detention of Left Socialist-Revolutionary \ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets in the Bolshoi Theatre. Lenin was realistically contemptuous about the \npotential strength of the armed resistance to his forces. He opined \nthat, for all the inefficiencies of the Bolsheviks, the Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries were in a sorrier condition and were chattering instead \nof organising. 50 \nLenin acted speedily for two reasons. First, he wanted to catch the \nLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries unawares. The sole advantage to \nBerlin in retaining the Bolsheviks in power was their adherence to \nBrest-Litovsk. Without this, Lenin would be useless to the Germans. 51 \nLenin carried out the mission with distaste. In March, when the \nBrest-Litovsk treaty was being signed, he had firmly refused to attend \nthe ceremony: he wanted to limit his association with what he described \n 14 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas 'the obscene peace'.'52 On arrival at the embassy, Lenin carried out the necessary \nformalities.53 \nLenin was glad to leave the embassy a few minutes later. The Left \nSocialist-Revolutionaries perceived what fate lay in store for them. To their horror they saw that the \nBolsheviks aimed at their suppression. \nAn unplanned revolt against Bolshevik power began. \nLenin resumed practical control. To Vacietis \nhe posed the question: 'Comrade, will we last out till morning.57 Yet he may also have begun to understand that the \nbalance of forces, ill-trained as most of them were on both sides, might \nsuddenly change to the disadvantage of the Bolsheviks.59 Yet \nTrotski can hardly have been high in Lenin's esteem at the time. The \npreservation of 'Soviet power' depended entirely upon the loyalty and \nefficiency of a Latvian officer who was neither a Bolshevik nor a \nproven military officer. \nFortunately for Lenin, Vacietis completed his task splendidly. The former \ncoalition partners of the Bolsheviks went down to defeat; almost \nwithout noticing it, Lenin and the core of Bolshevik Central Committee \nmembers had passed over the threshold from a two-party revolutionary \ndictatorship into an outright dictatorship by one party. \n 16 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMANOEUVRE, RETREAT, WAIT \nLenin knew that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk depended entirely on the \nGerman government's intentions, and that these in turn were shaped \nby success or failure for German forces on the Western front. \nLenin did not lie supine in the meantime. \n'We know,' Lenin had reassured the Fourth Congress of Soviets in \nMarch 1918, 'that Liebknecht will be victorious one way or another; \nthis is inevitable in the development of the workers' movement.'65 But what did Lenin say to \nthose who claimed that, since Brest-Litovsk, he had no independent \npolicy.67 \nPlaying one capitalist power against another was, Lenin urged, the sole \noption available in the circumstances. Lenin's political survival depended on Allied military \nsuccess in the West at least until such time as the long-expected \nrevolution should break out in Berlin. Every political party in Russia regarded the \nBolsheviks as traitors. \nNot even Lenin wished to give public display of such submissiveness. Allegedly the action \nshowed that an alliance had been formed between the Russian \n 18 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbourgeoisie and German imperialism.77 The vote went four to one in favour of Lenin's policy \nof continued appeasement of Germany. Lenin's high-risk strategy did not go unperceived \nas such. Lenin was especially keen \nto secure backing from Trotski, who had been on the left side in the \nBrest-Litovsk controversy.79 Trotski and Zinoviev \nbacked Lenin.80 His \nsupport for Lenin disproved this. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were \nrecognised in Berlin as godless and anti-monarchical. 84 Lenin not only wanted to exhibit enthusiasm for \nBrest-Litovsk; he also increasingly wished to enlist the Germans in \ndefence of Soviet-held territory against further landings by the Allies. This information was as yet unavailable \nto Lenin. Yet Lenin anyway \nconsidered he had little choice. Consequently Lenin was even willing on 13 \nAugust to risk inviting the Germans, through Chicherin, to bomb \nArkhangelsk on Sovnarkom's behalf. Vorovski, Lenin asserted that 'we would \nbe idiots not to make use' of the confluence of Soviet and German \ngovernmental interests. The Germans and \nRussians had initialled a supplementary treaty to the Brest-Litovsk \narrangements on 10 August, and this was formally signed on 27 \n 20 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAugust. Lenin had misled himself. But \nBrest-Litovsk had at least ensured the sheer survival of the Bolsheviks \nin power. It was an achievement of Lenin's gamble in international \nrelations. \nTHE WRITING OF A CONSTITUTION \nLenin scoffed at constitutionalism in politics. In November 1917 he declared: 'The living creativity of the \nmasses is the basic factor in our new public order'; and he added: \n'Socialism is not created by commands from above. The \nBrest-Litovsk dispute pre-occupied the minds of both the Bolsheviks \nand the Left SRs.89 Sverdlov chaired the first discussions on 5 April, with \nrepresentatives in attendance from the Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-\nRevolutionaries and SR-Maximalists as well as from particular \nPeople's Commissariats. Sverdlov was commission chairman, and \nStalin was included as the Bolshevik official expert on the question of \nthe nationalities.90 Notable by his absence was Lenin. \nThe federal basis of the forthcoming Constitution had been \nestablished, on Lenin's recommendation, at the Third Congress of \n Merciless Retreat \n21 \nSoviets in January 1918.96 The contrast with Lenin was \nimpressive. Lenin, no less than Stalin, accepted federalism only under \nstrong duress.98 Yet Lenin was \nso unexercised by the constitutional question that he did nothing until \nSverdlov's commission reported back to the Central Committee.99 \nStalin was in any case closer to Lenin's viewpoint than were other \ncommission members. Bolsheviks such as M. 100 Sverdlov had to intervene on Stalin's \n 22 \nLenin: A Political Life \nside to insist that the government had already laid down 'national self-\ndetermination' as an unalterable basis of policy. The Left Socialist-Revolutionary went further: 'Comrade \nStalin has got so accustomed to such a situation that he has perfectly \nassimilated even the jargon of imperialism. This booklet, which had recently been published but \nhad been written in mid-1917, envisaged a revolutionary order with \nmuch greater scope for popular initiative than Lenin was willing to \ntolerate by 1918. All he could \nsay in reply was: 'Mention has been made here of comrade Lenin. I \nwould permit myself to remark that Lenin, so far as I know - and I \nknow very well -, has said that this project is worthless. The need \nfor any reference to national issues rankled so much that Pokrovski, a \nBolshevik, preferred Reisner's draft. Lenin and \nStalin in 1917 had taken pains to get the slogan of national self-\ndetermination accepted in the Bolshevik party, and were convinced \nthat its deployment would help the Bolsheviks in the Civil War. Lenin began to take an interest from a \ndistance. His main ambition for the Constitution was for it to rouse \nworkers and peasants to support the Bolsheviks. Lenin seized control, \npersuading his colleagues on the Central Committee to include an \n Merciless Retreat \n23 \nentirely new preamble. Instead he \nsubstituted a text already accepted at the Third Congress of Soviets, \nnamely 'The Declaration of Rights of the Labouring and Exploited \nPeople' submitted by Lenin to the Constituent Assembly in January \n1918.105 \nSverdlov, understandably miffed, behaved like a disciplined \nBolshevik and induced the commission to comply on 17 June. 106 The \nBolshevik Central Committee, looking at the result nine days later, was \nunimpressed. Lenin even threatened to remove the Constitution from \nthe agenda of the forthcoming Congress of Soviets. 109 Its final draft was \nperused by the Central Committee, in the presence of Lenin and \nTrotski, on 3 July. A last effort at polishing the style, but not the contents, was \nentrusted to Yuri Steklov; and it was Steklov, a leading ex-Menshevik \nwriter and editor, who was instructed to present the draft Constitution \nto the Fifth Congress of Soviets on 10 July 1918.' 11 By then the Left \nSocialist-Revolutionary revolt had been suppressed. Lenin did not even bother to speak at the Congress of \nSoviets session. But the Bolshevik party leadership cynically hoped to \nattract the support of non-Russian peoples by showing off federalism \nas a slogan. \n 24 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe dominant theme was class struggle. Article nine ran as follows: \n'The basic task of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal \nSoviet Republic, as adapted to the current transitional period, consists \nin the establishment of the dictatorship of the urban and rural \nproletariat and poorest peasantry in the form of the mighty All-\nRussian Soviet power with the aims of the complete suppression of the \nbourgeoisie, the elimination of the exploitation of man by man and the \nintroduction of socialism, under which there will be neither a division \ninto classes nor state power. Lenin had argued at length in his recently-published State and \nRevolution that socialism would be an entirely distinct phase of history \nbetween capitalism and communism. 115 It was Lenin who made this inference for the first time, \nand it is by no means proven that he had correctly understood the \nstandpoint of Marx; but it quickly became a tenet of Bolshevism. Yet \nLenin did not intend to agitate himself and his comrades over a \nquestion of Marxism which since 1917 had been dear to him. 118 The same section implicitly \ncleared the ground for the Bolsheviks to outlaw any political parties, \norganisations or newspapers. Vladimir Lenin would only \nbother with constitutional trifles when his current political purposes \nwere threatened. Trotski, Dzierzynski and Lenin \nconfronted a near-disastrous military situation. \nThe Bolshevik leaders had also seen the uses of the prisoners-of-war \ntaken by Russian armies in 1914-1917, especially those from the lands \nof the Hapsburg monarchy (and the Constitution itself had been \nformulated so as to grant citizenship to all foreigners working in Russia \nor fighting in the Red Army). Workers supplied slightly \n 26 \nLenin: A Political Life \ngreater enthusiasm. 126 \nTrotski's efforts were intensified when the Czechoslovak Legion, on \nentering into Samara, put itself at the disposal of the Komuch \ngovernment of Socialist Revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the \nBolsheviks in Moscow. \nBonch-Bruevich (who, despite his anti-socialist convictions, was \nbrother to Lenin's personal assistant Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich). Lenin stayed in Moscow in \nAugust. The \nfollowing note was dispatched to Trotski from Lenin: 'I'm sure that the \nsuppression of the Czechs and White Guards, as well as the \nbloodsucking kulaks who support them, will be a model of \nmercilessness.' 130 \n Merciless Retreat \n27 \nIf Lenin harboured a suspicion that Trotski might wage war in too \nsensitive a spirit, he had misjudged him. This \nprovoked outrage in the Bolshevik party. Rozengolts headed the court martial, was unrepentant \nand sought Lenin's support on 23 October. This was Lenin's birthplace. Lenin failed to understand the \ngeographical limitations of the Red victory. The Socialist Revolutionaries decamped \neastwards. \nLenin was not the sole Bolshevik to exult, and Pravda editorials were \nunderstandably keen to emphasise the successes in battle. Yet the \n 28 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncentral party leaders, both in the Kremlin and by the Volga, had little \nknowledge about other Russian forces being formed to attack the \nReds. From three sides of the compass \nthere was a threat to the existence of the Bolshevik party and the Soviet \ngovernment. Yet Lenin referred to none of them in his telegrams in \n1918.", "Comrade_Lenin_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. A question \nof the same order arises in connection with Lenin: would the history of \nthe USSR have been greatly different if premature illness had not \nended his life. \nIt is necessary to pause before proceeding to the dramatic last \nmonths of Lenin's career in order to take stock of the issues. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. Generations of Stalin's enemies took this as \nproof positive that he indeed betrayed true Leninism. But Lenin's \njudgement is not reliable. Nothing said \nor done by the dying Lenin suggested that he had changed his mind on \nsuch fundamental essentials of post-October Leninism. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. We cannot be sure; but it is also improbable that the War \nCommunist methods used in the late I 920s to pulverise the peasantry \ninto submission and undertake the collectivisation of agriculture by \nmain force would have occurred to Lenin as a desirable project. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Nobody proclaimed Lenin's \nconstancy more loudly than that other great claimant to his mantle: \nLev Trotski. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought. He also tried to indicate that, had he lived, Lenin would have \nespoused policies identical with Trotski's.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. \nBukharin was to assert that, as they talked in the beautiful gardens \nand woods at Gorki, Lenin confided a novel idea of the possibilities of \na 'transition to socialism'.4 Lenin purportedly had come to believe that the local \npeasant community could be persuaded eventually to tum itself into a \ncollective farm and that this transformation, be it accomplished only at \na snail's pace, would be the decisive factor in the party's revolutionary \nstrategy. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. He supported Lenin's line on the national question; but he \nwas also opposed to Lenin in the foreign-trade dispute and had been \ncomplicit in the deception of Lenin when Mariya Volodicheva handed \nLenin's dictated notes to Stalin. While \nLenin's emphasis lay upon the introduction of literacy and account-\nkeeping, Bukharin looked forward to workers developing their own \ncultural practices and institutions to replace 'bourgeois' dominion in \nsocial thought.6 \nBolshevik leaders shared in politics more than they individually held \napart. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. It is not inconceivable that Bolshevik policies might \nhave been diverted on to a more peaceful, evolutionary path if the \nparty had been less centralised, if ordinary party members had had a \ngreater impact and if the brutalisation of politics in Russia had not \ngone to extraordinary lengths in the years immediately after the seizure \nof power in Petrograd. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. But privately he \nput it more starkly; for Lenin, the question was: 'Who leads.'8 Lenin the class warrior was \nnot politically defunct. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922. The Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate had not satisfactorily discharged the task of supervising \nand controlling its operations, and Lenin emphasised that the \nintroduction of workers to the Central Committee would improve \n Deaths and Entrances \n295 \nthe situation. 10 Lenin's similar criticism \nindicated that Trotski and he were drawing together. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. According to Lenin, the Pole had displayed 'a \ntruly Russian attitude'. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. \nLenin had also asserted that only the People's Commissariat of \nExternal Affairs was reliably devoid of influential figures from the old \nregime; and yet he failed to prescribe a remedy. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation. This was that Bolsheviks, while \nkeeping the USSR in existence, should accept that the plans for \nconstitutional integration might have to be dropped. He mentioned that the \nBolshevik-led republics would stay under general party discipline, \nand that any breakdown in co-ordination 'between Moscow and the \nother centres can be paralysed by party authority'.24 Lenin's passion was \ndistinct in every line, and this final political campaign was being \nmounted by a very determined 'Old Man'.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. I therefore urge comrades to think of a \nmethod for transferring Stalin from this position and to appoint \nanother person to this position who in all other respects differs from \ncomrade Stalin through the one advantage [i. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. Lenin guessed that he \nmight not have put a fully cogent case, and added: 'This circumstance \nmay appear an irrelevant triviality. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority).30 All that is \ncertain is that Lenin wanted to prevent Stalin from realising his \npotential to become the dominant Bolshevik leader; it is not even clear \nthat Stalin in Lenin's intention would be excluded from the Central \nCommittee. \nWith remarkable tenacity the sick Lenin meanwhile produced \narticles in abundance for Pravda. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). Lenin, \nunder his wife's influence, acknowledged that 'a new posing of \nquestions of pedagogy' was desirable; but apparently this would \nmainly involve a reconsideration of the treatment of religion in the \nschools; and he urged that propagandists should emphasise the \nallegation that Jesus Christ had never lived.36 Inverted commas embraced the adjective: Lenin sensed that \nits usage bore a resemblance to the kind of remark made by Victorian \ncapitalist philanthropists. After all, his wife \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nGalina had put their flat at the disposal of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee on 10 October 1917 when the decision to seize power had \nbeen taken. \nLenin postulated that Sukhanov displayed 'the pedantry of all our \npetit-bourgeois democrats'. There were bound to be 'several partial novelties' in the \nestablishment of socialism under the Bolsheviks. \nLenin freely conceded that, in Marxist terminology, the level of \n'development of the productive forces' was too low for the immediate \ninception of socialism in Russia.42 But he appended a question: 'If the \ncreation of socialism demands a definite level of culture (although \nnobody can say precisely what is constituted by this definite \"level of \nculture\" since it is different in each of the West European states), why \ncan't we make our beginning by using revolutionary means for the \nconquest of the prerequisites for this definite level and only \nsubsequently, on the basis of worker-and-peasant power and the \nsoviet order, move onwards to catch up other peoples.'43 No question \nmark appeared at the end of the sentence, indicating that Lenin \nassumed that its contents were sufficiently self-evident to provoke no \ncontradiction. Before 1917 he, too, had assumed that socialism could not \nbe introduced before social and cultural prerequisites were satisfied; \nand between the February and October Revolutions he had avoided \nthe topic.48 \nInstead Lenin adduced Marx's hope (as expressed in a letter of 1856) \nthat a dual revolt of workers and peasants might overthrow German \ncapitalism.49 The Bolsheviks in Lenin's view followed this tradition. To \nhis dying breath, he avoided recourse to Marx's favourable comments \non the Russian populists, who wanted to base a socialist society upon \nwhat they took to be the egalitarian practices and potential of the \npeasant village commune; he opposed agrarian socialism: his Marxism \ncontinued to hymn the virtues of workers, towns and large-scale \norganisation. Lenin remained true to himself to the end, and the \nequivocations of Marx himself in the last years of his life were \nignored. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, still \nhad him as its People's Commissar; and Lenin had complained about \nits efficiency. \nLenin had originally called upon the Secretariat to be more efficient in \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nits preparation of materials for Politburo sessions. Much as had been done to promote \nworking-class people to administrative position in the Soviet state, he \ndeclared for the first time that such workers were 'insufficently \nenlightened'. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. There \nwere also signs of changes in social policy in the West which, by \nbettering material conditions, might serve to postpone the revolu-\n Deaths and Entrances \n303 \ntionary explosion predicted by Lenin since mid-1914. The \nproblem for the Bolsheviks and the Soviet state was to hold on long \nenough, and he definitively rejected the assumption that the transition \nto socialism in the USSR would be fast. But more \nlikely the entire political camp of capitalism would be distracted from \nan anti-Bolshevik crusade by struggles by their respective colonies for \nnationalliberation.63 \nThe Bolshevik party, hoping for this favourable outcome, should \nconcentrate on the maintenance of the supposed leadership by the \nworkers over the peasantry. \nThus would the Soviet Union endure until the times became propitious \nfor the worldwide socialist revolution.64 Lenin the visionary and the \ninspirer of his party declared that 'these are the great tasks I am \ndreaming about'. Pravda printed his \npiece on 4 March 1923. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got. While detesting Trotski, he recognised the danger that \nthe alliance between Lenin and Trotski might constitute. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission).76 \nLenin had to act fast.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling. The problem for them was that Lenin was \nwell enough to check whether his article was printed. A single copy of the newspaper including the article should \nbe printed for Lenin's benefit on 25 January. 79 \nLenin's authority as party leader had not vanished; and, while being \nworried by questions of state administration, he was pre-occupied by \nthe political business in Georgia. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed. They deplored the suggestion by Lenin that, if preventive \nmeasures were not taken, a split in the central party leadership was a \ndistinct possibility.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. A strong hint was \ndropped that Lenin, divorced from participation in Politburo \ndiscussions, was not really au fait with current issues. It was signed \nnot only by Stalin and Kamenev but also by Trotski.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities.85 Lenin remonstrated with \nVolodicheva: 'Ifl had my freedom, I could easily do all this for myself. \nKrupskaya accidentally blurted out the details of Stalin's behaviour \non the night of 22 December 1922. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. '89 \nOn the same day he asked Trotski to take up the Georgian \nBolsheviks' case on his behalf.90 Trotski was urged, too, to contact \nKamenev, who was not at one with Stalin in the matter and was about \nto depart for the Georgian Communist Party Congress. Simultaneously Lenin was developing tactics with ever \ngreater confidence (even though his physical condition was worsening \nas a result of his mental agitation).93 All this was kept from Lenin as he \ndictated a note to Mdivani and Makharadze: 'With all my heart I am \nfollowing your cause.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. His note as deposited in Lenin's office referred to \nthe duty laid upon him to see that no political information reached \nLenin as he convalesced and to Krupskaya's infringements.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. But \ncringe before Lenin he would not. What saved him from \na goring by the bullish Lenin was nothing he did in his own defence but \nthe rapid decline in Lenin's health. But a \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmild, temporary improvement in May 1923 induced the doctors to \nstate that, so long as a specially-upholstered vehicle could be provided \nand driven at a slow pace, the patient should be transferred again to \nGorki. 103 Nadezhda \nKrupskaya and Mariya Ulyanova were in more or less constant \nattendance, and Krupskaya took lessons so as to be able to teach Lenin \nto speak. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. And, despite his \nenormous will-power, Lenin also wept profusely. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). Lenin's sudden collapses into \ntearfulness would now be considered a normal aspect of his medical \ncondition. The doctors treating Lenin were doing their best at \na time when the understanding of the brain was at a much lower level \n Deaths and Entrances \n309 \nthan today. Krupskaya had every right to be sceptical about the \ndoctors; and Lenin, remembering that his father had died of the same \nillness in his early fifties, had cause for his underlying pessimism. An appeal based on \nthe opportunity for work was the likeliest to get through to Lenin. This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. But she reckoned \nwithout Lenin's physical recuperation. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. None of them were Bolsheviks: Lenin had \na highly-developed contempt for those among his comrades who had \nqualified as doctors. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. This involved an attack on the one leader, apart from Lenin, \nwho was clearly hostile to him: Trotski. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. Lenin's note demanding an apology to Krupskaya had \nput him on guard; and Trotski, following up the points made by Lenin \nin his article, wrote to Stalin asking him to incorporate several \namendments in the theses prepared by Stalin for the forthcoming Party \nCongress. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. 135 Nothing could better illustrate \nTrotski's lack of political nous: the premium on being perceived as \n Deaths and Entrances \n313 \nLenin's faithful follower had never been higher. 139 Trotski retorted that \nhe had had no knowledge that Lenin had wanted immediate \npublication, and Stalin backed down in conversation with him. 141 Further consultations \nled to a decision on 18 April to divulge Lenin's article not to the party \nat large nor even to the Twelfth Congress as a whole but instead only to \nthe heads of provincial delegations to the Congress. \nStalin also knew that, in Bolshevik debates on the national question in \nthe past, he himself had been closer to the core of his party's opinion \nthan had Lenin; and he continued to benefit from the fact that Lenin's \nrecommendation for the sacking of Stalin from the General Secretary-\nship was unknown to the rest of the Politburo. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. 146 \nIn reality he knew that not even Lenin had urged the dissolution of the \nTrancaucasian Federation. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. \nStalin's bid to seem the loyal and trusted adjutant of Lenin continued \nas he presented Lenin's proposals for internal party re-organisation to \nthe Congress. 1411 \n'Lenin' and 'Leninism' had, for the first time, become entirely the \nplaythings of Bolsheviks other than Lenin. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. It was a \nterm ostensibly resisted by Lenin in his active life since he claimed only \nto conserve, replicate and develop the ideas of Marx and Engels. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. 155 The veneration of Lenin burst \nprevious limits: he was seer without equal; he was doughty national \nhero; he was unblemished saint; he was the light of the world. \nThe purpose of the reverential excess was plain: Lenin was to be used \nas a means of gathering support for the central party leaders within the \nparty and for the party in society as a whole. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. They abhorred the wish to treat Lenin's corpse, whensoever \nit became available as such, as if it were the reliquium of an Orthodox \nChurch saint; their Marxist world-view was offended. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup. Dogged by ill-\nhealth and laden with the image of a disturber of the Leninist party \nleadership, he was tactically outplayed. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "Travel_To_Siberia_1921": " Then \ncame Nikolai Gorbunov.

From 1921, however, the regime wished to calm the \napprehensions of society. 186 But the focus was retained on the Socialist Revolution-\naries. Soviet Russia was \ncharacterised rather by 'state capitalism'.204 But he insisted that, even though the \nproletariat had supposedly become the ruling class, the economy \nremained essentially capitalistic; and he stressed the need to keep \ncapitalism within acceptable bounds.", "Bolshevik_Party_Policy_1921": " The Bolsheviks declared adherence to the strictest \ncentralism and discipline in successive versions of their rule-book; but \nfactions, organised or semi-organised, continued to exist despite the \nresolution banning them at the Tenth Party Congress. \nNaturally this was not how Bolsheviks critical of Lenin saw matters. Lenin \nsaw things differently, to the point of outright exasperation. ' 1 Thus Lenin refuted the claim that he had \nestablished a dictatorship over the party; but his own words, with their \ncondescending implication that Joffe was overwrought because of an \nexcessive workload, was evidence of a confident dominance bordering \n219 \n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \non arrogance. And the Politburo ruled the country in the interstices of the \nCentral Committee meetings. A Politburo member ran each of them. Lenin chaired \nSovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence; Kamenev the \nMoscow City Soviet and the Moscow City Party Organisation; Trotski \nthe People's Commissariat of Military Affairs; Stalin the People's \nCommissariat of Nationality Affairs and the Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate; and Zinoviev the Executive Committee of the Communist \nInternational and the Petrograd City Party Organisation. But just as the People's Commissar of Military Affairs had \nthe right to poke his nose into economic strategy, so Lenin interfered in \ninnumerable corners, large and small, of public life. Never having been good at delegating responsibility, he felt no \nimpulse to change his habits while the Soviet state attempted to \nimplement the contentious New Economic Policy. Like other \nBolshevik leaders, he had heard and ignored critics like the Democratic \nCentralists who said- among other things- that the party ought to re-\norganise its bodies in Moscow in pursuit of greater efficiency. So long \nas dominant and reliable figures such as Sverdlov and Stasova were in \ncharge, Lenin had not cared a fig. \nLenin treated him brusquely.5 Lenin's letter was really \nan instance of the party's supreme leader driving a subordinate to \nhigher levels of industriousness. A purge was announced in June 1921. But there was also a stated goal of removing \nBolsheviks who had failed to carry out party instructions: this was \nclearly aimed at activists who, despite the ban on factions at the Tenth \nParty Congress, campaigned overtly for their views. Around a quarter of the entire membership of the Russian \nCommunist Party was expelled by the end of the year.9 Yet \nthe mud did not stick to Lenin (in contrast to the way it caked him in \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrelation to his economic retreat of 1921 ). Lenin acknowledged to Stalin that he was \nnot quite au fait with the scale of the Orgburo's activity in re-assigning \nparty officials to jobs across the country. Lenin and Stalin were allies. 11 It was not as if \nLenin himself was uninvolved in assignments of personnel at the very \nhighest level. 12 \nThere is no sign that Lenin was unhappy about the policy on \nassignments pursued by Stalin and Molotov. 13 \nHis distance from the implementation of intra-party discipline \npermitted him to take a paternal attitude to dissentient Bolsheviks. Myasnikov, who inspired several \nactivists who proceeded to form the small anti-Bolshevik socialist \nparties, such as Workers' Truth and Workers' Group, after the Tenth \nParty Congress. Another socialist who had influenced them was none \nother than Lenin's inveterate adversary Aleksandr Bogdanov. 15 Lenin responded \nseverely: 'Why insist on this mistake of yours, this clear mistake, on this \nnon-party, anti-party slogan: \"freedom of the press\". 17 But Lenin was also comradely: 'We'll get \ntogether and we'll work amicably in the same party.' 18 Most \nBolsheviks, however critical they were of Lenin, assumed that in some \nrecess of his mind he meant well. Lenin seemed to many as a one-man \ncourt of appeal when Bolsheviks felt that the party's principles were at \nstake. On \n20 February 1922, the Politburo expelled him from the party. On 14 October 1921 Lenin submitted \na draft instruction to be issued by the Politburo, reaffirming the \nvalidity of the Orgburo's decision about Shlyapnikov.20 \nBehind the scenes Lenin was therefore as firm as the rest of the \nPolitburo in tightening the disciplinary screws.21 On 4 June 1921 the Politburo at Molotov's prompting \nrequired him to take a break from work until the following month.27 Equally odd was his favouring of Tsyurupa \nafter the trouble between them when the the tax in kind was first being \ndiscussed and implemented; but Tsyurupa had come to recognise that \nthe New Economic Policy was a fact of political life and was probably \nflattered that Lenin thought highly of his technical competence. In any \ncase, Lenin had made his overtures rather late. Before a definitive \n 224 \nLenin: A Political Life \nofficial decision could be taken, he had to apply for extended sickness \nleave on 6 December: 'Comrade Molotov, I'm leaving today. Not only did he write articles as well \nas memos but also he made working trips to Moscow: he was \ndetermined to keep himself involved in the politics of the central party \nleadership.29 \nIn the Politburo there was little enthusiasm for Lenin's suggestion. \nBelow the Politburo, Sovnarkom was the most influential institution in \nthe Soviet state. No doubt Lenin had thought he had squared all the \navailable circles by including Tsyurupa, a doubter about the New \nEconomic Policy, in his thinking. If Lenin was not going \nto hold the Sovnarkom chairmanship actively, then his immediate \ncolleagues - Kamenev, Stalin, Trotski and Zinoviev - needed time for \ndiscussion and compromise before agreeing as to who should become \nhis temporary deputies.30 It deserves emphasis that they were not (as is \noften supposed in East and West) unreasonable in their reluctance to \naccede to Lenin's proposal. Not \nonly did Lenin play down his worries but also his doctors were \ngenerally encouraging. A hurried decision on the management of \nSovnarkom was not to the Politburo's liking; in those winter months \nwhen party and government were hard pressed by questions of \neconomics, internal security and foreign policy had their attention. \nA further factor was the wariness of each central Bolshevik leader \nabout his colleagues after the disputes among them in 1920-1921. Lenin's proposal, mild and merely technical \n Against the Wall \n225 \nthough it seemed, could easily have re-opened controversy. Lenin the \nanti-factionalist, moreover, was a factionalist himself when his interests \nwere in danger. Lenin's motives could not always be assumed to be of the \npurest type. \nIt is possible that Lenin continued to grind his factional axe even in \nthe winter of 1921-1922. Lenin took \ntrips to Moscow which allowed him to participate in intra-party \ndiscussions. Lashevich and pass on the scheme in \nthe name of Stalin and Lenin. Whatever may be the accuracy of the \nmemoir, the supporters of the Platform of Ten may indeed have \ndecided to restrict the support for Trotski at forthcoming party \ngatherings in Moscow; and, even if Lenin was not involved in such \nschemes, he would have been a beneficiary of them. At Lenin's instigation, Trotski had been rebuffed when \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemanding greater emphasis on central state planning, and was \npredictably unwilling to grant automatic sanction to Lenin's proposal \nfor a formal system of deputies in Sovnarkom. \nTHE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERN A TJONAL \nLenin's troubles with non-Bolsheviks were considerably fewer than \nwith the party.36 Just as the Decree on Land in October 1917 had become known \nas 'Lenin's Decree', so the abolition of War Communism was counted \nunto him for virtue. Nor did anti-Bolshevik profes-\nsional cadres employed by the Soviet state withhold admiration even \nthough he was still capable of letting the Cheka loose upon individuals \namong them. While Lenin attentively watched over his Russian \nCommunist party in the changing conditions of 1921, he took his eye \noff his leading comrades in Germany, Italy, Britain and France.38 But a debate could not indefinitely be \npostponed: a questionnaire was issued to fraternal communist parties \nabout the prospects of revolution in the rest of Europe. 39 Quietly Lenin \nhad decided what kind of answer he would accept. Whereas in \nautumn 1917 Lenin would have had no objection to such thinking, in \n1921 he thought it to be 'the cretinity of the \"leftists\"'.46 \nLenin, burdened by the Soviet domestic political agenda, took three \nmonths after the Tenth Party Congress before inserting himself into the \naffairs of European communism. But Lenin and Trotski did not conspire with each other. At Lenin's insistence, they included a phrase about the need to \nget the support of 'the majority of the working class' before power \nshould be seized.49 Even so, the leaders of the Communist \nParty of Germany felt betrayed by this compromise, and wrote to \nLenin defending their past actions. \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNext day they wrote to the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, still unapologetically describing the Action as a step \nforward for the communist movement. 50 Lenin stated that he was sorry \nfor showing his anger at his meeting with them.53 \nBy then Lenin, Trotski and Kamenev were working closely to thwart \nZinoviev, Bukharin and their supporters in the Communist Interna-\ntional. The Russian Communist \nParty's mastery of the international communist movement was \nconsolidated. To the Congress's surprise, he \nproceeded to justify the open letter written by Paul Levi calling for a \npolitical alliance of all the parties of German socialism in January 1921 \n(even though Lenin still refrained from seeking Levi's re-instatement in \nthe Communist Party of Germany). Lenin \ntold the Congress that the German communists should adopt the \nRussian Bolshevik strategy of 1917. Supposedly the October Revolu-\ntion in Petrograd was attempted only after the party had secured 'the \nmajority of soviets of workers' and peasants' deputies' on its side. The Bolsheviks acquired a neat majority even in \nthe urban soviets only after the Petrograd seizure of power, and \nSocialist Revolutionaries of various types were favoured by most \npeasants.62 In sessions thirteen and fourteen, on 2 July, the overtly \ncomradely ambience among the leaders of the Russian Communist \nParty was destroyed.63 Lenin had missed the proceedings. He \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \npresumably calculated that, as long as his principal aims were not \nchallenged, he should let the other Bolshevik leaders deal with the \nproblems; his health, too, was bothering him.64 But Lenin declined their request.66 \nLenin tacitly recognised this by opting to present a report on Russia \nrather than on Europe.67 This came in session seventeen on 5 July with \nthe debate on 'The Tactics of the Russian Communist Party'. His \narguments for the New Economic Policy as delivered to the Tenth \nParty Conference in May 1921 were replicated with confidence. \nBolsheviks had heard it all before. For the delegates to the Congress \nof the Communist International it was the earliest available chance to \nlisten to Lenin himself explaining the measures of reform. Lenin spoke for \none hour and ten minutes.68 His comment was ignored: Lenin's theses were adopted by \nacclaim. In August 1917 I too was an \nemigre and made too \"leftist\" a proposal to the Central Committee \nwhich fortunately was utterly rejected. Lenin repeated that lessons had to be learned \nfrom Bolshevik history. \nAcknowledgement of personal error was Lenin's most obvious \ncharacteristic. 73 \nLenin and his Bolshevik associates, having dominated the Congress, \nhad an incentive to give the impression that the Communist \nInternational provided its member parties with equal rights.75 Lenin could tolerate the \ncomplaint. \nTHE ARTS, SCIENCES AND SCHOLARSHIP UNDER LENIN \nThe changes in Bolshevik foreign policy, now ratified by the \nCommunist International, preceded the agrarian reform discussed \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom February 1921 and embodied in law in April. Measures to \nsupervise the country's arts had begun with the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in Petrograd.76 Not only active \npoliticians but also novelists and poets with strongly anti-Bolshevik \nopinions were put on guard that Sovnarkom would retaliate against \nstrong criticism by barring their access to printing facilities. Lenin had given approval \nin November 1917 to the introduction of a state monopoly in the \nreprinting of the Russian classics. \nLenin's pre-occupations were understandably with the Whites, the \nforeign interventionist forces, the party, food supplies to the cities, the \nComintern. The arts impinged little on either his political activity or his \nintellectual concerns in the early years of 'Soviet power'.79 The choice of subjects can hardly have been Lenin's. A book on Russo-French relations \nbetween 1910 and 1914 was castigated for 'the shameless, truly Soviet \nslovenliness for which the punishment should be prison'.87 \nLunacharski, with Lenin's contented acquiescence, was empowered \nto instigate and co-ordinate artistic policy. The right to emigrate was frequently withheld in case the \nindividuals should propagate anti-Soviet ideas abroad. Lenin dimly perceived this. In private he conceded \nthat nearly all existing writers (and he was always more sensitive to \nliterary than to other artistic developments) hated the Bolsheviks: 'New \nwriters must be created from the workers, from the peasants.'89 \n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis was a common party aspiration.90 Lenin followed their line. had been used by \nLenin as the title of his own 1902 pamphlet on party organisation.92 But it was words \non the printed page that evoked the supreme enthusiasms of the \nBolshevik leader.96 Otherwise \nLenin found him and the self-styled 'Futurists' uncongenial.97 Similarly permission for Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nwho continued to write on social and political theory, to publish and \nlecture was within the gift of the Politburo: Lenin kept his ex-Bolshevik \nadversary on a tight rein.98 \nCensorship held no horrors for Lenin. \n Against the Wall \n235 \nThis was not said openly by him or any other Bolshevik leader. They came in two articles: 'Lev Tolstoi as the Mirror of the \nRussian Revolution' and 'Party Organisation and Party Literature'. Thus the Russian peasantry was anarchistic, obscurantist \nand backward-looking while also reaching forward to new forms of \nsociety. Lenin claimed that Tolstoi inadvertently summarised this \nvision and failed to draw the necessary political conclusion: namely \nthat only class struggle, and not pacifism or a sentimental ruralism, \nwould transform the life of the people. Lenin was no better and no worse than nearly \nall his comrades in boiling down works of art to their contribution to \npolitics. \nIndeed, writing 'Party Organisation and Party Literature' in 1905, \nLenin had called for party-mindedness to be embodied in works of art: \n'What does this principle of party literature consist of.' 100 \nNaturally we have to remember that Lenin wrote these words about \na party which did not yet have power and, furthermore, a party which \nhad exiguous finances and limited access to printing facilities. Lenin's \npurpose at the time was to advise how to organise the party's \nnewspapers (and to commission and control literary contributions to \nthem) while being under threat from the Romanov monarchy. The boundary between what was pro-party and what \n 236 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwas anti-party was definable by reference to the party programme. Lenin added: 'Freedom of \nspeech and press must be complete. 103 A distinct autonomy seemed to be offered by Lenin to \nliterature. Coming from \nLenin, however, it was freighted with menace for freedom of the arts \nunder socialism. \nDespite acquiring a posthumous reputation as the founder of Soviet \nartistic policy, he was not at the centre of discussions when the \nBolshevik central leadership at last confronted the problem that the \nparty had not acquired a phalanx of party litterateurs. Zinoviev presented the leadership's conclu-\nsions to the Twelfth Party Conference in August 1922 (while Lenin was \nrecuperating from a stroke). \nThe resultant resolution conceded that Bolsheviks, since they did not \nhave many litterateurs, would have to find tolerable allies among \nliterary groups which at least did not oppose them. This was not far from \nthe principle enunciated by Lenin in 1905. 110 It was a great pity, for the \nfate of Soviet literature in the 1930s, that he was too ill to re-affirm \nsuch a commitment in 1922. The foreign policy \nof Soviet Russia was held tightly in Lenin's grasp. Unlike other \nholders of important jobs in Soviet politics, consequently, he needed \npatronage in order to make his way. \nInternational relations were highly contentious among leading \nBolsheviks; but Lenin and Chicherin agreed on most matters and \npriorities. Like a traditional foreign \nminister bargaining on behalf of a weak state, Lenin wanted to \nmanoeuvre between various capitalist powers; he wanted to play them \nofT against each other. Lenin's objective was the securing of further economic and \npolitical agreements with the advanced industrial countries. He was adamant that the Soviet state's policies, \ncustoms and laws were not up for barter. If capitalist countries, \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindividually or collectively, wanted to deal with the Bolsheviks on this \nbasis, well and good. If not, the Bolsheviks could and should bide their \ntime. For him, the Anglo-\nSoviet trade agreement of March 1921 was but a springboard into the \npool of a continental settlement grander even than the Versailles treaty. Throughout his years in power Lenin had \nacted as if an orientation towards the German government might be \nmore useful, if only in the short term, than the quest for a pan-\nEuropean settlement. Karl Radek, presumably \nwith Lenin's knowledge, published an article in Pravda on 4 December \n1921 urging German politicians and businessmen to recognise their \nopportunities in Soviet Russia. On 3 January 1922 he proposed \nthat the Soviet authorities should reject the Allied terms as totally \nunacceptable. A conference would be held in Genoa and the \nBolsheviks would be invited to attend. Lenin became even \nmore pessimistic about the proposed international conference. 118 But Lenin \nthought himself indispensable to the Revolution, and on 12 January \nwrote to the Politburo declaring that not only he but also Trotski and \nZinoviev should be prohibited from travelling abroad at all. Everyone wanted to see what \nLenin looked like. Appetites \nhad been whetted by lurid reportage, and the prospect of the Soviet \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \nleader's appearing in the streets and on newsreels had been attractive. But Lenin was immovable. 120 \nThe technical preparations continued to worry Lenin. 124 Lenin's \ntoughly anti-British and pro-German orientation was now fixed in his \nmind. But the Central \nCommittee, no less than Lenin, did not want Lenin to leave Moscow \n- and in any case his health still gave grounds for worry. 126 Lenin \ncontinued to harass the People's Commissariat of External Affairs. 127 Lenin was having none of it. Lenin successfully \nrecommended that the Soviet delegation should make its proposals in a \n'bourgeois-pacifist' spirit. Now he \nresolutely opposed Lenin's attempt to play on what both of them \nregarded as pacifist illusions. 129 But Lenin insisted, reassuring \nChicherin that the party leadership's commitment to communism \nand non-pacifism was undiminished. 130 On 16 February, Lenin \nrepeated to Chicherin that the Soviet delegates should not panic. Divisions among \ncapitalist powers should be encouraged; and under no circumstances, \nLenin demanded, should Chicherin sign anything without consulta-\ntions with Moscow. Lenin's recklessness \nalarmed him. Chicherin for his part was \nrestricted by the Politburo's adhesion to the viewpoint of Lenin. Lenin persuaded the \nPolitburo that a telegram be sent instructing Chicherin to correct this \nderogation from official party policy. The 'Russians' and \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Germans renounced all claims against each other about war losses \nand damage as well as about nationalised property. 139 \nAt the same session Lenin accused the Soviet delegation of having \nbeen too soft in negotiations.140 But \nLenin would not let the matter drop. 141 Lenin was undeterred.' 43 But there the matter rested, and \nLenin calmed down and started to enjoy his achievements of the past \nmonths. From 1921, however, the regime wished to calm the \napprehensions of society. This did not mean that a law-based order was the \nparty's objective; on the contrary, the Bolsheviks remained legal \nnihilists - and Lenin in this respect was their principal theorist. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. Lenin stipulated that the Bolsheviks should \nreserve the option of terrorist methods. 147 By 1 December \n1921, Lenin had been won over, and he helped draft a Politburo minute \nfor the narrowing of the Cheka's powers of arrest and for the \nreinforcement of the revolutionary tribunals as the source of judgement \nand sentencing. Incommoded \nby ill-health, Lenin left the business to his associates. Lenin made plain, in a \nletter to the veteran Cheka leader Unszlicht, that the reform's effects \nwere to be restricted. In other words, the Cheka's \nabolition would be a cosmetic operation; and Lenin required an \nincrease in the 'speed and force of the repressions' by the Cheka \nofficers. 152 \nUnszlicht, who became the deputy chairman of the Main Political \nAdministration, was encouraged by Lenin to use him as an \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermediary in the Politburo on behalf of repressive agencies. 153 Lenin \nstressed that the Bolsheviks refused to 'recognise courts that were \nabove classes'. Lenin, ex-lawyer from the Volga, \nwas unfussed by legal niceties; be called for the Civil Code to have a \npropagandistic passage linking such activities to 'the international \nbourgeoisie and its struggle against us' . 156 \nLenin in his last period was not a proponent of legal reform and \nuniversal civic rights.' 59 \nLenin worried especially about the anti-Bolshevik parties. Exemplary punishment, in Lenin's opinion, was necessary. 161 Lenin supported \nDzierzynski, and on 22 February 1922 wrote to Kurski urging the \n'putting on of a series of model trials in Moscow, Piter [Petrograd: \nR. On 27 March 1922 he answered criticism \nby the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with the threat: \n'Kindly let us stand you against the wall for this1'163 An international \nmeeting of socialists was taking place in Berlin with Bolshevik \nparticipation.164 Lenin \nwas angered. The repression of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, according to Lenin, was \nonly half of the business. He wanted the \nSoviet press to conduct a campaign linking anti-Bolshevik socialists in \nRussia with 'the international bourgeoisie' . Popular opinion needed to be rallied to the Bolsheviks. Not \nconfining this repression to politics, Lenin aimed to retaliate against \nhostile opinion in culture. The Politburo accompanied its day-to-day \ngeneral control over the arts, science and scholarship169 with a sharp \nexemplary campaign of violence. Lenin wrote a memo to his personal \nassistant N. But Lenin's sentiment was a sign \nof his extreme worries about groups who might influence public \nopinion against Bolshevism.' 173 There was nothing \nin fact openly hostile to the Soviet government. The insulation of Soviet readers from thinkers who might \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndeflect them from Bolshevism was an explicit aim. Lenin worried only about the \ndetailed practical results. 176 The emphasis of \nstate policy, with Lenin's encouragement, lay upon vigorous atheistic \npropaganda. On 19 March 1922 Lenin wrote to the Politburo that the \necclesiastical authorities in the town of Shuya had organised a \ndemonstration against the government's decree on the compulsory \nsale abroad of ecclesiastical treasures to raise funds to relieve the \nfamine by the Volga. Events in Shuya, in Lenin's \nopinion, offered a chance to return to direct repression. Patriarch Tikhon should not be touched for fear of \nprovoking demonstrations against the Bolsheviks.' 177 \nThe Politburo met next day in Lenin's absence through illness. 179 \nThis was a severe decision even if it lacked Lenin's thirst for \nbloodletting. \nTrotski agreed with the convalescent Lenin's demand for execution. 180 \nLenin, who was known for melding ideological inclination with \nRealpolitik, had for the moment lost his touch. Lenin's reaction was ecstatic: 'True. The question whether to subject the Mensheviks to the same \ntreatment had been discussed again in the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee. 186 But the focus was retained on the Socialist Revolution-\naries. It had been fear of the peasants that had induced Lenin to \nintroduce the New Economic Policy, and it was logical for him to \nterrorise the party which was most popular among them. The charge \nsheet sought to implicate their Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee, not excluding those such as Viktor Chernov who was \nthen in emigration, with direct responsibility for the attempt on Lenin's \nlife in August 1918, for political and military support for the White \narmies and for post-war links with the Allied governments. The claim was outrageous that, from start to \nfinish, the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee had participated \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nactively in the counsels of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. Socialist \nRevolutionaries in a large number joined the Reds in the Civil War, \nand the Bolsheviks had recognised this by the amnesty granted to them \nin 1919. Little pretence at impartiality was made; the chairman of \nproceedings was Yuri Pyatakov, Bolshevik Central Committee \nmember. Speeches on the iniquity of the Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership were made by supposedly soft-hearted Bolsheviks such as \nNikolai Bukharin and Anatoli Lunacharski. Trotski was annoyed, arguing that lives should \nbe spared only if the defendants forswore hostile activity against the \nBolshevik party and the Soviet government. Great courage had been displayed \nthroughout the trial by most of the accused, and they were as unlikely \nto abase themselves before the Bolsheviks as the Bolsheviks would have \nbowed the knee to Aleksandr Kerenski. The Bolshevik party had shown its teeth \nand cowed its enemies. The party was to be presented with \ndecisions and consulted only minimally; the first year of the New \nEconomic Policy, coming after the disputes of 1920-1921, had been a \nbattering experience. Lenin considered it vital that a united front \nshould be formed by the Central Committee, and had exerted himself \n Against the Wall \n249 \nto this end despite ill-health as preparations were made for the opening \nof the Eleventh Party Congress in Moscow on 27 March 1922. 193 Shlyapnikov and Tomski had ceased to be vital threats to \nLenin's version of the New Economic Policy. Lenin and Preobrazhenski had exchanged fierce criticisms \nabout the impact of governmental measures upon various strata of the \npeasantry. The row had continued through the winter of 1921-1922, \nand Preobrazhenski wished to have the topic debated at the Party \nCongress194 Lenin needed to stop this at all costs; for Preobrazhenski, \narguing before a Bolshevik party audience about the bias of such \nmeasures in favour of the kulak, might well meet with a favourable \nresponse. On Lenin's instigation, the Politburo on 20 March 1922 \nrejected Preobrazhenski's theses, removed them from the Congress \nagenda and permitted Preobrazhenski only to address an unofficial \nside-gathering during the Congress proceedings. 196 \nThe tranquillising of the Congress was also ensured by Lenin's \nwillingness to deliver the Central Committee political report. One of its \nmembers, Emelyan Yaroslavski, proposed that each Department of the \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSecretariat should be headed by a Central Committee member. With its achievement Lenin looked forward to a \nCongress which would sanction the kind of New Economic Policy he \nhad put in place.202 \nLenin returned to the lectern to deliver the Central Committee's \npolitical report. \nBolsheviks needed to learn how to facilitate a resurgence of trade. \nLenin unashamedly repeated that the stage of economic development \nreached by the country was not socialist. Soviet Russia was \ncharacterised rather by 'state capitalism'. \nThey had acted impermissibly in appealing above the head of the \nRussian Communist Party to the other communist parties. Towards the Mensheviks and other non-\nBolshevik parties he was much less restrained.207 \nThe New Economic Policy as it stood, Lenin urged, could and \nshould be made to work. Lenin emphasised that the party already had \nsufficient political and economic power in its hands. The Bolsheviks, constituting a small \npercentage of the population, were dependent on a large and \n Against the Wall \n251 \nideologically alien state bureaucracy. Only when the masses had \nacquired the necessary skills in literacy and administration could the \nadvance be resumed, and Lenin made clear that the tiny communist \nminority itself could not really claim competence that made it the equal \nof, far less the victor over, the bourgeoisie. \nLenin was exempted from maltreatment; practically everyone who \ncastigated official practices and attitudes managed somehow to cloak \nthemselves with the legitimacy of the leader's past words. Mykola \nSkrypnik acclaimed Lenin's reference to the Ukraine's status as an \nindependent republic. His recommendation for the fonnation of an Econburo \nto accompany the Politburo, as Lenin commented, would not have \nbeen easy to demarcate.215 Lenin's unwillingness to \ndiscuss the agrarian underpinnings of the New Economic Policy was \nhighlighted. There were also criticisms of Lenin which were non-\nfactional in origin. Dmitri Manuilski, a Bolshevik leader in Kiev, \nobjected to his talking of Ukraine as an independent republic. Lenin's \nwill to maintain the public fiction of several independent republics \nattracted the Skrypniks and repelled the Manuilskis, and laid a basis \nfor a roaring controversy later in 1922. Trotski rallied \nto Lenin.219 \nLenin was pleased that no one bad called for the New Economic \nPolicy's abandonment; and, in mock self-disdain, he turned to critics \nsuch as Yuri Larin and noted that the 'terroristic power' that had \nvanquished the world's armies and installed a dictatorship of the \nproletariat had yet to win victory over 'Larin's army': 'Here we have a \ntotal defeat. They offered the chance for Trotski and Lenin to bury their \ndifferences. As in the Civil War, they agreed about most aspects of \nBolshevik party policy. But Lenin \nwanted a quiet Congress, not a dispute on authority inside factories -\nand anyway he probably did not want to put things as unreservedly as \nTrotski. The Congress delegates, \nlike Lenin, desired to avoid serious upset.230 \n'Speculation' was a dirty word in the Bolshevik lexicon. Sokolnikov, he declared, had deprived \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvital state industries of investment. Pyatakov and his supporters on the \nleft of the party did not urge a return to War Communism, but their \nvision of the New Economic Policy included a continued commitment \nto the priority of state-owned, large-scale industry. The Bolshevik \n'leftists', as they were soon to be described, were a bomb waiting to \nexplode. Moreover, he was reluctant to make too bold a \nrupture with his Politburo colleagues at a time of Lenin's illness.' Such sententiousness was used to justify the closure of \nfurther recruitment to the party on the grounds that far too many \ncareerists and non-Bolshevik socialists had infiltrated the ranks. Lenin was unhappy with the change of plan and moved to \nprevent any full-scale attack on the party's agrarian reforms. If there was to be a formal resolution, \nmoreover, Lenin wanted to include clauses on permission for the hiring \nof labour and the renting of land. Osinski concurred, and - with only \nslight modifications - Lenin's proposed clauses were accepted by the \nsection. 236 \nUkrainian Bolshevik leader V. Not for the last time, a leading \nUkrainian Bolshevik sought a hardening of the official line on \nagriculture.237 Osinski personalised his retort: 'Comrade Lenin clearly \ntried to fix this in place, and comrade Chubar is coming out precisely \nagainst it.239 Lenin closed the proceeding with a brief address.", "Foreign_Policy_1921": " \nHis attitude had begun to shift in 1921. A purge was announced in June 1921.40 This was in \nApril 1921. His \narguments for the New Economic Policy as delivered to the Tenth \nParty Conference in May 1921 were replicated with confidence. \nTHE ARTS, SCIENCES AND SCHOLARSHIP UNDER LENIN \nThe changes in Bolshevik foreign policy, now ratified by the \nCommunist International, preceded the agrarian reform discussed \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom February 1921 and embodied in law in April. Not so international relations. The foreign policy \nof Soviet Russia was held tightly in Lenin's grasp. His New Economic Policy, at \nleast as he initially perceived it, demanded the cementing of further ties \nwith the advanced capitalist countries. \nHe urged that an international business consortium be formed, \nincluding the Germans, for promotion of economic recovery in \neastern Europe and Russia (as well as for the promotion of recovery \n Against the Wall \n239 \nat home), and that a meeting should be held to discuss the terms \nwhereunder this might be done. By \n1921 the arrangements with Germany for increased trade and for joint \nmilitary training were already working well. From 1921, however, the regime wished to calm the \napprehensions of society. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. The party was to be presented with \ndecisions and consulted only minimally; the first year of the New \nEconomic Policy, coming after the disputes of 1920-1921, had been a \nbattering experience.203 His report was mainly taken up with a defence \nof the New Economic Policy.) had been the basic threat to the \nregime.", "Bolshevik_Parties_1921": " The Bolsheviks declared adherence to the strictest \ncentralism and discipline in successive versions of their rule-book; but \nfactions, organised or semi-organised, continued to exist despite the \nresolution banning them at the Tenth Party Congress. \nNaturally this was not how Bolsheviks critical of Lenin saw matters. Lenin \nsaw things differently, to the point of outright exasperation. ' 1 Thus Lenin refuted the claim that he had \nestablished a dictatorship over the party; but his own words, with their \ncondescending implication that Joffe was overwrought because of an \nexcessive workload, was evidence of a confident dominance bordering \n219 \n 220 \nLenin: A Political Life \non arrogance. And the Politburo ruled the country in the interstices of the \nCentral Committee meetings. \nThe other central public institutions were subordinate to the party \napparatus. A Politburo member ran each of them. Lenin chaired \nSovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence; Kamenev the \nMoscow City Soviet and the Moscow City Party Organisation; Trotski \nthe People's Commissariat of Military Affairs; Stalin the People's \nCommissariat of Nationality Affairs and the Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate; and Zinoviev the Executive Committee of the Communist \nInternational and the Petrograd City Party Organisation. Candidate \nmembers of the Politburo also had crucial posts. But just as the People's Commissar of Military Affairs had \nthe right to poke his nose into economic strategy, so Lenin interfered in \ninnumerable corners, large and small, of public life. Like other \nBolshevik leaders, he had heard and ignored critics like the Democratic \nCentralists who said- among other things- that the party ought to re-\norganise its bodies in Moscow in pursuit of greater efficiency. So long \nas dominant and reliable figures such as Sverdlov and Stasova were in \ncharge, Lenin had not cared a fig. \nLenin treated him brusquely.5 Lenin's letter was really \nan instance of the party's supreme leader driving a subordinate to \nhigher levels of industriousness. But there was also a stated goal of removing \nBolsheviks who had failed to carry out party instructions: this was \nclearly aimed at activists who, despite the ban on factions at the Tenth \nParty Congress, campaigned overtly for their views. Around a quarter of the entire membership of the Russian \nCommunist Party was expelled by the end of the year.9 Yet \nthe mud did not stick to Lenin (in contrast to the way it caked him in \n 222 \nLenin: A Political Life \nrelation to his economic retreat of 1921 ). Lenin acknowledged to Stalin that he was \nnot quite au fait with the scale of the Orgburo's activity in re-assigning \nparty officials to jobs across the country. Lenin and Stalin were allies. 11 It was not as if \nLenin himself was uninvolved in assignments of personnel at the very \nhighest level. 12 \nThere is no sign that Lenin was unhappy about the policy on \nassignments pursued by Stalin and Molotov. 13 \nHis distance from the implementation of intra-party discipline \npermitted him to take a paternal attitude to dissentient Bolsheviks. Myasnikov, who inspired several \nactivists who proceeded to form the small anti-Bolshevik socialist \nparties, such as Workers' Truth and Workers' Group, after the Tenth \nParty Congress. Another socialist who had influenced them was none \nother than Lenin's inveterate adversary Aleksandr Bogdanov. 15 Lenin responded \nseverely: 'Why insist on this mistake of yours, this clear mistake, on this \nnon-party, anti-party slogan: \"freedom of the press\". 17 But Lenin was also comradely: 'We'll get \ntogether and we'll work amicably in the same party.' 18 Most \nBolsheviks, however critical they were of Lenin, assumed that in some \nrecess of his mind he meant well. Lenin seemed to many as a one-man \ncourt of appeal when Bolsheviks felt that the party's principles were at \nstake. On \n20 February 1922, the Politburo expelled him from the party. On 14 October 1921 Lenin submitted \na draft instruction to be issued by the Politburo, reaffirming the \nvalidity of the Orgburo's decision about Shlyapnikov.20 \nBehind the scenes Lenin was therefore as firm as the rest of the \nPolitburo in tightening the disciplinary screws.29 \nIn the Politburo there was little enthusiasm for Lenin's suggestion. \nBelow the Politburo, Sovnarkom was the most influential institution in \nthe Soviet state. If Lenin was not going \nto hold the Sovnarkom chairmanship actively, then his immediate \ncolleagues - Kamenev, Stalin, Trotski and Zinoviev - needed time for \ndiscussion and compromise before agreeing as to who should become \nhis temporary deputies.30 It deserves emphasis that they were not (as is \noften supposed in East and West) unreasonable in their reluctance to \naccede to Lenin's proposal. A hurried decision on the management of \nSovnarkom was not to the Politburo's liking; in those winter months \nwhen party and government were hard pressed by questions of \neconomics, internal security and foreign policy had their attention. \nA further factor was the wariness of each central Bolshevik leader \nabout his colleagues after the disputes among them in 1920-1921. Lenin the \nanti-factionalist, moreover, was a factionalist himself when his interests \nwere in danger. Lenin's motives could not always be assumed to be of the \npurest type. \nIt is possible that Lenin continued to grind his factional axe even in \nthe winter of 1921-1922. Lenin took \ntrips to Moscow which allowed him to participate in intra-party \ndiscussions. Lashevich and pass on the scheme in \nthe name of Stalin and Lenin. Whatever may be the accuracy of the \nmemoir, the supporters of the Platform of Ten may indeed have \ndecided to restrict the support for Trotski at forthcoming party \ngatherings in Moscow; and, even if Lenin was not involved in such \nschemes, he would have been a beneficiary of them. At Lenin's instigation, Trotski had been rebuffed when \n 226 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndemanding greater emphasis on central state planning, and was \npredictably unwilling to grant automatic sanction to Lenin's proposal \nfor a formal system of deputies in Sovnarkom. \nTHE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST \nINTERN A TJONAL \nLenin's troubles with non-Bolsheviks were considerably fewer than \nwith the party.36 Just as the Decree on Land in October 1917 had become known \nas 'Lenin's Decree', so the abolition of War Communism was counted \nunto him for virtue. Nor did anti-Bolshevik profes-\nsional cadres employed by the Soviet state withhold admiration even \nthough he was still capable of letting the Cheka loose upon individuals \namong them. While Lenin attentively watched over his Russian \nCommunist party in the changing conditions of 1921, he took his eye \noff his leading comrades in Germany, Italy, Britain and France.38 But a debate could not indefinitely be \npostponed: a questionnaire was issued to fraternal communist parties \nabout the prospects of revolution in the rest of Europe. 39 Quietly Lenin \nhad decided what kind of answer he would accept. Whereas in \nautumn 1917 Lenin would have had no objection to such thinking, in \n1921 he thought it to be 'the cretinity of the \"leftists\"'.46 \nLenin, burdened by the Soviet domestic political agenda, took three \nmonths after the Tenth Party Congress before inserting himself into the \naffairs of European communism. But Lenin and Trotski did not conspire with each other. At Lenin's insistence, they included a phrase about the need to \nget the support of 'the majority of the working class' before power \nshould be seized.49 Even so, the leaders of the Communist \nParty of Germany felt betrayed by this compromise, and wrote to \nLenin defending their past actions. \n 228 \nLenin: A Political Life \nNext day they wrote to the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, still unapologetically describing the Action as a step \nforward for the communist movement. 50 Lenin stated that he was sorry \nfor showing his anger at his meeting with them.53 \nBy then Lenin, Trotski and Kamenev were working closely to thwart \nZinoviev, Bukharin and their supporters in the Communist Interna-\ntional. 54 Several days before the Congress opened in the Bolshoi \nTheatre on 22 June 1921 it was obvious that Kun and Thalheimer had \nlost the struggle, and that Zinoviev's remaining aim was to disguise his \nown incompetence and to pretend that he was near to the subsequently-\nestablished position of Lenin. The Russian Communist \nParty's mastery of the international communist movement was \nconsolidated. As Lenin had \nanticipated, the German participants expressed their opposition to the \nExecutive Committee's line; and Lenin felt it necessary to respond in \nthe eleventh session on I July. To the Congress's surprise, he \nproceeded to justify the open letter written by Paul Levi calling for a \npolitical alliance of all the parties of German socialism in January 1921 \n(even though Lenin still refrained from seeking Levi's re-instatement in \nthe Communist Party of Germany). Lenin \ntold the Congress that the German communists should adopt the \nRussian Bolshevik strategy of 1917. Supposedly the October Revolu-\ntion in Petrograd was attempted only after the party had secured 'the \nmajority of soviets of workers' and peasants' deputies' on its side. The Bolsheviks acquired a neat majority even in \nthe urban soviets only after the Petrograd seizure of power, and \nSocialist Revolutionaries of various types were favoured by most \npeasants.62 In sessions thirteen and fourteen, on 2 July, the overtly \ncomradely ambience among the leaders of the Russian Communist \nParty was destroyed.63 Lenin had missed the proceedings. He \n 230 \nLenin: A Political Life \npresumably calculated that, as long as his principal aims were not \nchallenged, he should let the other Bolshevik leaders deal with the \nproblems; his health, too, was bothering him.64 But Lenin declined their request.67 This came in session seventeen on 5 July with \nthe debate on 'The Tactics of the Russian Communist Party'. His \narguments for the New Economic Policy as delivered to the Tenth \nParty Conference in May 1921 were replicated with confidence. \nBolsheviks had heard it all before. Lenin spoke for \none hour and ten minutes.68 His comment was ignored: Lenin's theses were adopted by \nacclaim.69 But his was an organisation which had split from the official \nCommunist Party of Germany. In August 1917 I too was an \nemigre and made too \"leftist\" a proposal to the Central Committee \nwhich fortunately was utterly rejected. Lenin repeated that lessons had to be learned \nfrom Bolshevik history. 73 \nLenin and his Bolshevik associates, having dominated the Congress, \nhad an incentive to give the impression that the Communist \nInternational provided its member parties with equal rights.75 Lenin could tolerate the \ncomplaint. \nTHE ARTS, SCIENCES AND SCHOLARSHIP UNDER LENIN \nThe changes in Bolshevik foreign policy, now ratified by the \nCommunist International, preceded the agrarian reform discussed \n 232 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfrom February 1921 and embodied in law in April. Measures to \nsupervise the country's arts had begun with the Bolshevik seizure of \npower in Petrograd.76 Not only active \npoliticians but also novelists and poets with strongly anti-Bolshevik \nopinions were put on guard that Sovnarkom would retaliate against \nstrong criticism by barring their access to printing facilities. \nLenin's pre-occupations were understandably with the Whites, the \nforeign interventionist forces, the party, food supplies to the cities, the \nComintern.79 The choice of subjects can hardly have been Lenin's. Indeed there were occasions when Lenin \nprotected leading figures from the arts.87 \nLunacharski, with Lenin's contented acquiescence, was empowered \nto instigate and co-ordinate artistic policy. Lenin dimly perceived this. In private he conceded \nthat nearly all existing writers (and he was always more sensitive to \nliterary than to other artistic developments) hated the Bolsheviks: 'New \nwriters must be created from the workers, from the peasants.'89 \n 234 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThis was a common party aspiration.90 Lenin followed their line. had been used by \nLenin as the title of his own 1902 pamphlet on party organisation.92 But it was words \non the printed page that evoked the supreme enthusiasms of the \nBolshevik leader.' \nMayakovski's merit in his eyes lay only in satirising the endless \nmeetings characteristic of governmental and party activity.96 Otherwise \nLenin found him and the self-styled 'Futurists' uncongenial.97 Similarly permission for Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nwho continued to write on social and political theory, to publish and \nlecture was within the gift of the Politburo: Lenin kept his ex-Bolshevik \nadversary on a tight rein.98 \nCensorship held no horrors for Lenin. \n Against the Wall \n235 \nThis was not said openly by him or any other Bolshevik leader. They came in two articles: 'Lev Tolstoi as the Mirror of the \nRussian Revolution' and 'Party Organisation and Party Literature'. Thus the Russian peasantry was anarchistic, obscurantist \nand backward-looking while also reaching forward to new forms of \nsociety. Lenin claimed that Tolstoi inadvertently summarised this \nvision and failed to draw the necessary political conclusion: namely \nthat only class struggle, and not pacifism or a sentimental ruralism, \nwould transform the life of the people. Lenin was no better and no worse than nearly \nall his comrades in boiling down works of art to their contribution to \npolitics. \nIndeed, writing 'Party Organisation and Party Literature' in 1905, \nLenin had called for party-mindedness to be embodied in works of art: \n'What does this principle of party literature consist of.' 100 \nNaturally we have to remember that Lenin wrote these words about \na party which did not yet have power and, furthermore, a party which \nhad exiguous finances and limited access to printing facilities. Lenin's \npurpose at the time was to advise how to organise the party's \nnewspapers (and to commission and control literary contributions to \nthem) while being under threat from the Romanov monarchy. The boundary between what was pro-party and what \n 236 \nLenin: A Political Life \nwas anti-party was definable by reference to the party programme. Lenin added: 'Freedom of \nspeech and press must be complete. 103 A distinct autonomy seemed to be offered by Lenin to \nliterature. Coming from \nLenin, however, it was freighted with menace for freedom of the arts \nunder socialism. \nDespite acquiring a posthumous reputation as the founder of Soviet \nartistic policy, he was not at the centre of discussions when the \nBolshevik central leadership at last confronted the problem that the \nparty had not acquired a phalanx of party litterateurs. Zinoviev presented the leadership's conclu-\nsions to the Twelfth Party Conference in August 1922 (while Lenin was \nrecuperating from a stroke). \nThe resultant resolution conceded that Bolsheviks, since they did not \nhave many litterateurs, would have to find tolerable allies among \nliterary groups which at least did not oppose them. The foreign policy \nof Soviet Russia was held tightly in Lenin's grasp. Unlike other \nholders of important jobs in Soviet politics, consequently, he needed \npatronage in order to make his way. \nInternational relations were highly contentious among leading \nBolsheviks; but Lenin and Chicherin agreed on most matters and \npriorities. Like a traditional foreign \nminister bargaining on behalf of a weak state, Lenin wanted to \nmanoeuvre between various capitalist powers; he wanted to play them \nofT against each other. If capitalist countries, \n 238 \nLenin: A Political Life \nindividually or collectively, wanted to deal with the Bolsheviks on this \nbasis, well and good. If not, the Bolsheviks could and should bide their \ntime. Karl Radek, presumably \nwith Lenin's knowledge, published an article in Pravda on 4 December \n1921 urging German politicians and businessmen to recognise their \nopportunities in Soviet Russia. A conference would be held in Genoa and the \nBolsheviks would be invited to attend. Lenin became even \nmore pessimistic about the proposed international conference. 118 But Lenin \nthought himself indispensable to the Revolution, and on 12 January \nwrote to the Politburo declaring that not only he but also Trotski and \nZinoviev should be prohibited from travelling abroad at all. Everyone wanted to see what \nLenin looked like. Appetites \nhad been whetted by lurid reportage, and the prospect of the Soviet \n 240 \nLenin: A Political Life \nleader's appearing in the streets and on newsreels had been attractive. But Lenin was immovable. 120 \nThe technical preparations continued to worry Lenin. 124 Lenin's \ntoughly anti-British and pro-German orientation was now fixed in his \nmind. But the Central \nCommittee, no less than Lenin, did not want Lenin to leave Moscow \n- and in any case his health still gave grounds for worry. 126 Lenin \ncontinued to harass the People's Commissariat of External Affairs. 127 Lenin was having none of it. Lenin successfully \nrecommended that the Soviet delegation should make its proposals in a \n'bourgeois-pacifist' spirit. Now he \nresolutely opposed Lenin's attempt to play on what both of them \nregarded as pacifist illusions. 129 But Lenin insisted, reassuring \nChicherin that the party leadership's commitment to communism \nand non-pacifism was undiminished. 130 On 16 February, Lenin \nrepeated to Chicherin that the Soviet delegates should not panic. Lenin's recklessness \nalarmed him. Lenin persuaded the \nPolitburo that a telegram be sent instructing Chicherin to correct this \nderogation from official party policy. The 'Russians' and \n 242 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe Germans renounced all claims against each other about war losses \nand damage as well as about nationalised property. 139 \nAt the same session Lenin accused the Soviet delegation of having \nbeen too soft in negotiations.140 But \nLenin would not let the matter drop. 141 Lenin was undeterred.' 43 But there the matter rested, and \nLenin calmed down and started to enjoy his achievements of the past \nmonths. This did not mean that a law-based order was the \nparty's objective; on the contrary, the Bolsheviks remained legal \nnihilists - and Lenin in this respect was their principal theorist. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. Lenin stipulated that the Bolsheviks should \nreserve the option of terrorist methods. 147 By 1 December \n1921, Lenin had been won over, and he helped draft a Politburo minute \nfor the narrowing of the Cheka's powers of arrest and for the \nreinforcement of the revolutionary tribunals as the source of judgement \nand sentencing. Incommoded \nby ill-health, Lenin left the business to his associates. Lenin made plain, in a \nletter to the veteran Cheka leader Unszlicht, that the reform's effects \nwere to be restricted. In other words, the Cheka's \nabolition would be a cosmetic operation; and Lenin required an \nincrease in the 'speed and force of the repressions' by the Cheka \nofficers. 152 \nUnszlicht, who became the deputy chairman of the Main Political \nAdministration, was encouraged by Lenin to use him as an \n 244 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermediary in the Politburo on behalf of repressive agencies. 153 Lenin \nstressed that the Bolsheviks refused to 'recognise courts that were \nabove classes'. Lenin, ex-lawyer from the Volga, \nwas unfussed by legal niceties; be called for the Civil Code to have a \npropagandistic passage linking such activities to 'the international \nbourgeoisie and its struggle against us' . 156 \nLenin in his last period was not a proponent of legal reform and \nuniversal civic rights. Lenin's apparent humanitarianism was displayed \nonly fitfully.' 59 \nLenin worried especially about the anti-Bolshevik parties. On 27 March 1922 he answered criticism \nby the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries with the threat: \n'Kindly let us stand you against the wall for this1'163 An international \nmeeting of socialists was taking place in Berlin with Bolshevik \nparticipation.164 Lenin \nwas angered. The repression of the \nMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, according to Lenin, was \nonly half of the business. He wanted the \nSoviet press to conduct a campaign linking anti-Bolshevik socialists in \nRussia with 'the international bourgeoisie' . Popular opinion needed to be rallied to the Bolsheviks. Not \nconfining this repression to politics, Lenin aimed to retaliate against \nhostile opinion in culture. The Politburo accompanied its day-to-day \ngeneral control over the arts, science and scholarship169 with a sharp \nexemplary campaign of violence. Lenin wrote a memo to his personal \nassistant N. But Lenin's sentiment was a sign \nof his extreme worries about groups who might influence public \nopinion against Bolshevism.' 173 There was nothing \nin fact openly hostile to the Soviet government. The insulation of Soviet readers from thinkers who might \n 246 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndeflect them from Bolshevism was an explicit aim. Patriarch Tikhon should not be touched for fear of \nprovoking demonstrations against the Bolsheviks.' 177 \nThe Politburo met next day in Lenin's absence through illness. 180 \nLenin, who was known for melding ideological inclination with \nRealpolitik, had for the moment lost his touch. Lenin's reaction was ecstatic: 'True. The question whether to subject the Mensheviks to the same \ntreatment had been discussed again in the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee. 186 But the focus was retained on the Socialist Revolution-\naries. It had been fear of the peasants that had induced Lenin to \nintroduce the New Economic Policy, and it was logical for him to \nterrorise the party which was most popular among them. The charge \nsheet sought to implicate their Socialist-Revolutionary Central \nCommittee, not excluding those such as Viktor Chernov who was \nthen in emigration, with direct responsibility for the attempt on Lenin's \nlife in August 1918, for political and military support for the White \narmies and for post-war links with the Allied governments. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was \nindeed involved in the episode at the former Mikhelson factory, and \nmany of its members fought for Komuch against the Reds. The claim was outrageous that, from start to \nfinish, the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee had participated \n 248 \nLenin: A Political Life \nactively in the counsels of Kolchak, Denikin and Yudenich. Socialist \nRevolutionaries in a large number joined the Reds in the Civil War, \nand the Bolsheviks had recognised this by the amnesty granted to them \nin 1919. Little pretence at impartiality was made; the chairman of \nproceedings was Yuri Pyatakov, Bolshevik Central Committee \nmember. Speeches on the iniquity of the Socialist-Revolutionary \nleadership were made by supposedly soft-hearted Bolsheviks such as \nNikolai Bukharin and Anatoli Lunacharski. Trotski was annoyed, arguing that lives should \nbe spared only if the defendants forswore hostile activity against the \nBolshevik party and the Soviet government. Great courage had been displayed \nthroughout the trial by most of the accused, and they were as unlikely \nto abase themselves before the Bolsheviks as the Bolsheviks would have \nbowed the knee to Aleksandr Kerenski. The Bolshevik party had shown its teeth \nand cowed its enemies. Lenin considered it vital that a united front \nshould be formed by the Central Committee, and had exerted himself \n Against the Wall \n249 \nto this end despite ill-health as preparations were made for the opening \nof the Eleventh Party Congress in Moscow on 27 March 1922. The row had continued through the winter of 1921-1922, \nand Preobrazhenski wished to have the topic debated at the Party \nCongress194 Lenin needed to stop this at all costs; for Preobrazhenski, \narguing before a Bolshevik party audience about the bias of such \nmeasures in favour of the kulak, might well meet with a favourable \nresponse. On Lenin's instigation, the Politburo on 20 March 1922 \nrejected Preobrazhenski's theses, removed them from the Congress \nagenda and permitted Preobrazhenski only to address an unofficial \nside-gathering during the Congress proceedings. 196 \nThe tranquillising of the Congress was also ensured by Lenin's \nwillingness to deliver the Central Committee political report. One of its \nmembers, Emelyan Yaroslavski, proposed that each Department of the \n 250 \nLenin: A Political Life \nSecretariat should be headed by a Central Committee member.202 \nLenin returned to the lectern to deliver the Central Committee's \npolitical report. \nBolsheviks needed to learn how to facilitate a resurgence of trade. Soviet Russia was \ncharacterised rather by 'state capitalism'. Now we must say in the name of the party: enough. \nThey had acted impermissibly in appealing above the head of the \nRussian Communist Party to the other communist parties. Towards the Mensheviks and other non-\nBolshevik parties he was much less restrained. Lenin emphasised that the party already had \nsufficient political and economic power in its hands. The Bolsheviks, constituting a small \npercentage of the population, were dependent on a large and \n Against the Wall \n251 \nideologically alien state bureaucracy. Mykola \nSkrypnik acclaimed Lenin's reference to the Ukraine's status as an \nindependent republic. His recommendation for the fonnation of an Econburo \nto accompany the Politburo, as Lenin commented, would not have \nbeen easy to demarcate.215 Lenin's unwillingness to \ndiscuss the agrarian underpinnings of the New Economic Policy was \nhighlighted. \nNext day, at session three, Lenin was attacked by Workers' \nOpposition leader Aleksandr Shlyapnikov (who nevertheless referred \n 252 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto him as Vladimir Ilich). There were also criticisms of Lenin which were non-\nfactional in origin. Dmitri Manuilski, a Bolshevik leader in Kiev, \nobjected to his talking of Ukraine as an independent republic. Lenin's \nwill to maintain the public fiction of several independent republics \nattracted the Skrypniks and repelled the Manuilskis, and laid a basis \nfor a roaring controversy later in 1922.218 Manuilski claimed to have put Lenin right in private \nconversation. Trotski rallied \nto Lenin.219 \nLenin was pleased that no one bad called for the New Economic \nPolicy's abandonment; and, in mock self-disdain, he turned to critics \nsuch as Yuri Larin and noted that the 'terroristic power' that had \nvanquished the world's armies and installed a dictatorship of the \nproletariat had yet to win victory over 'Larin's army': 'Here we have a \ntotal defeat. Lenin declined to \nassist: it was enough for Lenin that the political and organisational \nreports of the Central Committee were passed by a huge majority. They offered the chance for Trotski and Lenin to bury their \ndifferences. As in the Civil War, they agreed about most aspects of \nBolshevik party policy. But Lenin \nwanted a quiet Congress, not a dispute on authority inside factories -\nand anyway he probably did not want to put things as unreservedly as \nTrotski. The Congress delegates, \nlike Lenin, desired to avoid serious upset.230 \n'Speculation' was a dirty word in the Bolshevik lexicon. Sokolnikov, he declared, had deprived \n 254 \nLenin: A Political Life \nvital state industries of investment. The Bolshevik \n'leftists', as they were soon to be described, were a bomb waiting to \nexplode. Moreover, he was reluctant to make too bold a \nrupture with his Politburo colleagues at a time of Lenin's illness.' Such sententiousness was used to justify the closure of \nfurther recruitment to the party on the grounds that far too many \ncareerists and non-Bolshevik socialists had infiltrated the ranks. Lenin was unhappy with the change of plan and moved to \nprevent any full-scale attack on the party's agrarian reforms. 236 \nUkrainian Bolshevik leader V. Not for the last time, a leading \nUkrainian Bolshevik sought a hardening of the official line on \nagriculture.", "Factionalism_1921": " \nEven the single party in a one-party state can encounter difficulty in \neliminating factionalism from its affairs; indeed, as in Kenya in the \n1970s and Zimbabwe in the 1980s, the indulgence of factions can act as \na safety-valve for the maintenance of the regime. When \nAdolf Joffe had written to him in this vein, he responded on 17 March \n1921 with text and verse on the difficulties he perennially faced in \ngetting his way: 'The old Central Committee (1919-1920) beat me \ndown on one of the most gigantically important questions, as you \nknow from the discussion [about the conflict between the Water-\nworkers Union and Tsektran in the early stage of the \"trade union \ncontroversy\"]. \nThe other central public institutions were subordinate to the party \napparatus. Lenin the \nanti-factionalist, moreover, was a factionalist himself when his interests \nwere in danger.38 But a debate could not indefinitely be \npostponed: a questionnaire was issued to fraternal communist parties \nabout the prospects of revolution in the rest of Europe. Literary matters must become a part of the \ngeneral proletarian cause, must become \"a cog-wheel and screw\" of a \nsingle, monolithic, great social-democratic mechanism brought into \nmotion by the entire conscious vanguard of the entire working class.' 132 So-called petit-bourgeois and \nbourgeois-pacifist support should be sought. From 1921, however, the regime wished to calm the \napprehensions of society. Discussions on a Civil Code began in higher party circles in the \nwinter of 1921-1922. The Politburo accompanied its day-to-day \ngeneral control over the arts, science and scholarship169 with a sharp \nexemplary campaign of violence.216 An internal party grouping that should \nhave been ended its life in the previous year was far from being \nmoribund. There were also criticisms of Lenin which were non-\nfactional in origin.", "Warders_In_Prison_1922": "", "Occasion_Lenin_1922": " And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. \nBolshevik leaders, including Lenin, were irked that a retreat from \nsupposedly socialist policies had been forced upon them. Not only Lenin and Trotski but also the rest \nof the Politburo peppered their public statements with references to the \nFrench Revolution and its eventual retreat from ideological radicalism. \nLenin's illness reduced the chances for differences of opinion \nremaining amicable in the Politburo.5 Even so, Lenin kept his own pessimistic \ncounsel.10 \nLenin had always been attentive about his health.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. \nMaksim Gorki heard from Lenin about the pains in his head; his sister \n Testament to a Revolution \n259 \nMariya remarked how savage they had become by the winter of 192(}-\n1921. On that occasion Lenin had tried to \nmake little of his difficulty: 'My leg's tired, I've got pins and needles. The novelty was that Lenin now urged that Rykov and \nTsyurupa should use the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (or \nRabkrin) as their main administrative apparatus of supervision.21 \nThe sole full member of the Politburo to approve Lenin's scheme was \nKamenev.22 Lenin irritatedly replied on 5 May, defending Rabkrin and \nrejecting Trotski's demands about the State Planning Commission. If Trotski had a correct perception of \nthe weakness of the scheme Lenin advocated, Lenin was right to \nspeculate that Trotski was using the occasion to trundle out old hobby-\nhorses from their stables. \nTrotski and Lenin argued as if it could be taken for granted that \nLenin would shortly return to his political jobs. The scheme proposed \nby him was carefully limited to the matter of his Sovnarkom deputies \n 260 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand their functions. Not \neven his stroke on 25 May 1922 changed his attitude, and Lenin was \ndetermined to resume his full duties with all speed. 7 \nLenin, his bossy exuberance and his eye for detail restored to him, \nplanned to re-enter political activity and its intensity. Another hypothesis was that Lenin was suffering merely \nfrom massive over-work.30 \nThere was another potential diagnosis which the Politburo withheld \nfrom public deliberations: namely that Lenin had syphilis.32 Nevertheless Lenin also \nimpressed them with his naivete about such a possibility even though \nhe made an effort to consult lots of medical textbooks so as to diagnose \nhimself. On the other hand, it may be that Lenin had had some \nextra-marital liaison more recently, perhaps even since the October \nRevolution, and that Averbakh's test was unable to detect a syphilitic \ncondition in its early stages. As yet we cannot say beyond peradventure \nthat Lenin was not suffering from it. \n 262 \nLenin: A Political Life \nAtherosclerosis, which is one of the forms of what is still commonly \nreferred to as arteriosclerosis or 'hardening of the arteries', is often \nassociated with hypertension.37 This perfectly characterised Lenin's circumstances. After Lenin's \nmajor stroke had taken place, furthermore, the chances of recovery had \ngreatly narrowed; and they were rendered exiguous in the extreme by \nhis resolve to resume his duties just as soon as the initial debilitation \nhad disappeared. \nYet Lenin simply could not understand a life outside politics.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke. Valentinov also noted that, in the pre-revolutionary \nyears, it was usually a crisis in politics which precipitated the elation or \nthe depression in Lenin. Lenin had always thought that the New Economic \nPolicy would involve severe restrictions upon the influence of \ncapitalists.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation.45 \nBy early March 1922 he had appeared to have won;46 but already on \n15 May he was worried enough to write to Stalin as General Secretary \nof the Central Committee requesting the Politburo's approval for a \ndirective confirming the monopoly. The \nPolitburo accepted Lenin's request on 22 May - only three days \nbefore his major stroke.49 Lenin's summer \nconvalescence gave the proponents of denationalisation their chance. 5\u00b0 If Lenin and Trotski \nhad trusted each other better, things might have been different. On 12 September, Lenin wrote to the Politburo brusquely \nurging that the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade should be \nignored. Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski. Since its inception, he had stressed that the New \nEconomic Policy should involve the maintenance of state control over \ntrade; and he saw terrible dangers in any lessening of control: 'A \n 266 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspecialist-smuggler at the frontier is one thing; but it is entirely another \nmatter to have the entire peasantry which will defend itself as a whole \nand fight against any authority trying to deprive it of its \"own\" \nprofit'. After \nconsulting the other members, he announced the postponement \nrequested by Lenin. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session. As the Congress drew to \nits close, Lenin began to contemplate the debate on foreign trade \npostponed until the forthcoming Central Committee plenum \nNevertheless signs had been visible in previous weeks that he was not \nas well as he seemed. The severe aches and pains returned on 25 November, and \nLenin was incapacitated. Mariya Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] said not to \nbother him with anything- and that, if he himself enquires after the \nanswers, to ask whomever is appropriate.'67 The doctors this time were successful in their \ninsistence: Lenin was to stop work absolutely for a whole week.70 Lenin was a tough old bird and in \nfact kept on working; but on 13 December, at eleven o'clock in the \nmorning, his doctors advised that he would be seriously at risk if his \ndisobedience continued.71 Lenin obeyed, but \nonly after arranging contingency measures for the Central Committee \nplenum. By midday on 12 \nDecember Lenin had made up his mind to ask Trotski for support.73 To Lenin's delight, Trotski replied \npositively the same day. \nLenin had turned the tables on them. It is striking how \nsimilar were Lenin's arguments to those he had used in inaugurating \nthe New Economic Policy.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership.81 \nLenin's health problems in the winter of 1921-1922 had pushed him \ncloser and closer to Stalin.82 \nLenin needed a new Sverdlov, and he thought Stalin would fit the bill \ndespite the unsettled relations between them in the past. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress. Just such a colleague - a colleague who had \nappeared to concur with Lenin on most fundamental current issues -\nwas to Lenin's liking as he himself made arrangements for his \nconvalescence.90 At \nthe plenum of the Central Committee it was Lenin who intervened to \nput minds at rest. Quite \nthe reverse: Lenin thought the General Secretaryship so important that \nits first holder was asked to liberate himself from governmental posts in \norder to discharge his duties. Lenin urged that the time had come for \nthe entire Secretariat to be overhauled.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time. If anyone else had made such a proposal, \nespecially if it had involved a loss of operational control by Lenin, he \nwould have judged the man insane.94 Lenin on this occasion was \nignored by his colleagues. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. He wished to allay any suspicion \nharboured by Lenin that the Politburo was doing things which, if he \nhad been fit, would have incurred Lenin's displeasure. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin.99 Lenin put Stalin at his ease. When Lenin suggested that \npolice surveillance should be instituted on his doctors, Stalin took this \n 272 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas the sign of a return to health. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. Lenin, frequently despairing of \nmaking a full recovery, asked Stalin for poison. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. Why had Lenin chosen his political colleague for this \nmission. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. In one of his several reminiscences about old adversaries, Lenin \nspoke fondly about Yuli Martov. The conversation had \nlasted only five minutes, and was the second time when Lenin had \nextracted the promise. \nRevealing what had passed between him and Lenin, he asked them \nwhat he should do. Lenin perked up a little at this and asked: 'Are you up to some \ncunning.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. He himself had \nalways had ambitions as a theorist as well as an administrator, and \nevidently thought his writings on the national question to be a \nsubstantial contribution to a growing revolutionary corpus; and, while \nStalin could not match the flashes of inspiration in the humanities and \nthe social sciences displayed by Trotski and Bukharin, there is little in \nthe work of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Pyatakov or any other outstanding \nBolshevik politician which put them out of his intellectual class. \nLenin's overt friendliness to Stalin was anyway predicated upon \nneed. Their past disagreements had once provoked \nTrotski to shout at Lenin that he was a 'hooligan' at a Politburo \nmeeting. 112 This self-restraint \n 274 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmight now pay dividends. Lenin was acquainted with Trotski's vanity. Lenin was choosing him \nin the absence of a sensible and reliable alternative and was giving no \nguarantee that, should his own health be restored to him, he would not \nrevert to a more cautious relationship. He had his greatest impact when \nworking with the approval of Lenin. The October Revolution and the \nCivil War had brought them together, and Lenin was inviting Trotski \nto resume close collaboration. \nTHE GEORGIAN AFFAIR \nLenin's rumblings in the dispute over foreign trade were a pallid \nrehearsal of his volcanic eruption about the new Constitution. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. If Stalin was impervious to their \npleas, then surely Lenin would help them. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. 120 A week later the Politburo \nestablished a commission to investigate the issues; its chairman was to \n 276 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbe Frunze. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. The trouble caused \nby Frunze and his associates happened barely a week before Lenin's \nstroke. If Lenin was to affect the outcome of discussions, he had to act \nat long range as well as to combat the debilitating effects of his illness. There is no sign that Stalin's 'autonomisation' \nproject was discussed by Lenin and Stalin at the Gorki sanatorium in \nthe summer. The result was that, despite their vehement disagreement \nin 1920, Lenin remained confident that Stalin would yield to him: only \ngradually did he conclude that the General Secretary was not only \nintransigent but even devious on the matter. \nAfter the Russo-Ukrainian flurry and Lenin's stroke the question \nwas again pushed into the background. Only on 10 August, weeks \nbefore Lenin returned to work in the Kremlin, did the Politburo \ninstruct the Orgburo to 'prepare the question of the interrelationships \nbetween the RSFSR and the independent republics'. 126 Stalin was deputed to write a \nproject for its perusal. 129 \nThe decks were cleared for a struggle between Lenin and Stalin; and \nStalin, quite apart from having the advantage of being fit and active, \nfelt that he had reason on his side and that the party would support \nhim. The memory of Lenin's difficulties on the 'national question' in \n1917-1919,130 when Stalin had been mainly on his side, reinforced \nStalin's intuition that Lenin would lose this time. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. 143 It was at \nthis point that Lenin came back into the reckoning. Lenin agreed with the charge \nthat Stalin was pressing the accelerator too hard. Equally disruptive \nwas Stalin's letter to the Politburo on 27 September objecting to the \nestablishment of separate legislative organs for the Union of Soviet \nRepublics and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic: a clear \nattempt to re-introduce his old project by the back door. Lenin would see to that.'149 \nLenin had got his tail up. Lenin was well enough \nto attend, but had to withdraw at midday because of toothache. 151 \nMdivani, though disappointed, wrote to Georgia describing how \nvigorously Lenin had put his arguments. 154 \nStalin in any case saw that Lenin was not properly recovered. When \nLenin returned to chair Sovnarkom on 3 October, an agreement held \namong its members to avoid controversy lest he become agitated. 163 In vain did the resigners \nwrite to Lenin protesting the justice of their cause. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests. 169 \nLenin in Moscow was beginning anyway to see the need to keep an \neye on Stalin.172 Lenin was appalled. 173 Lenin's illness ~revented his attendance at meetings, but he \nstarted to dictate notes.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. \nThey were also collectivists and, although no one doubted that Lenin \nhad enjoyed a predominant political position, he had no formal title to \nthis effect within the party. \nThe only leader who could broach the question was Vladimir Ilich \nLenin himself, and it was typical of his tough-mindedness that he \ndetermined to do so. On 23 December 1922 he called Mariya \nVolodicheva to him: 'I want to dictate you a letter to the Congress. Lenin did not even specify how to ensure that the workers \nwere chosen on an unbiased basis. 182 Lenin's perspicaciousness was dipping here. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. 183 \nNone of the six colleagues came out well from Lenin's comments. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). 'I shall merely recall,' Lenin stated , 'that the \nepisode of Zinoviev and Kamenev in October was, of course, no \ncoincidence. On Bukharin, \nLenin's comments were equally astringent.' Lenin was merciless: 'He has \nnever studied and, I think, never fully understood dialectics. Lenin had concluded that not \none of his highly-placed colleagues was worthy to succeed him. \nLenin did not claim that the plan was a panacea. This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin. The dictated words stopped short of such a conclusion; for \nLenin found it distasteful to draw attention to himself directly. 188 He had mentioned Trotski's excessive 'self-\nconfidence' (again without sign of sensing how easily the description \n 286 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfitted him too). 'But I hope,' Lenin added, as if chiding himself \nfor his gloomy thoughts, 'that this is an all too distant future and an all \ntoo improbable event to talk about.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. Lenin's bipartite summary of the party's \ndependence on the two classes, furthermore, omitted to mention its \nreliance on the sprawling administrative stratum in order to maintain \nits own 'stability'. Be that as it may, what is striking about Lenin's \njudgement is his correct perception that a party split could occur even if \na policy dispute about the working class and the peasantry did not \ndivide Trotski and Stalin. Lenin foresaw that a schism was possible \nsimply over issues of personal jealousy and ambition. 192 \nCOVERT OPERATIONS \nWhat Lenin did in his character sketches was odd; but, in strict terms, \nhe had not infringed the prohibition upon his political activity imposed \nby the Central Committee plenum on 18 December. Evidently Lenin aimed to have an independent source of \ninformation: yet another sign that he took nothing and no one, not \neven his new ally Trotski, for granted. The plenum resolved to remove \nLenin from all connection with active politics for the duration of his \nillness, and devolved upon Stalin an 'individual responsibility for \nVladimir Ilich's isolation as regards both personal relations with \nofficials [of the party: R. Lenin reeked nought of this. '201 Krupskaya kept the incident secret from Lenin, \nhowever, on the grounds that he might be upset. \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThat Stalin could have lost his own self-control to the extent of bad-\nmouthing his leader's wife and comrade is remarkable. It may be that, \nas was rumoured about him not long afterwards, he had already \nconcluded that Lenin's life was fast drawing to its close and that he had \nnothing to lose. Perhaps he judged that 'Lenin is kaput' . But he also knew about Lenin's resilience. Lenin was still a dangerous and important \npiece on the chess-board. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.205 Lenin evidently was intent on some political \nreform, and no one had more to lose from this than Stalin. But when \nshe saw Fotieva and their colleague Mariya Glyasser next day, these \n Testament to a Revolution \n289 \ntwo expressed horror at her action in destroying Lenin's letter. \nVolodicheva was summoned again by Lenin the same evening.'213 Lenin felt reassured that his words would remain \nconfidential. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session. All three were friends, and Lenin must surely have trusted \nthem implicitly.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command.218 \nNothing can yet be proved, but it would not be totally surprising if \nthese young women, squeezed in a vice of contrary loyalties and \nsensing that Lenin would not last much longer, continued to yield \ninformation to Stalin.", "Europe_And_Asia_1922": "", "Foreign_Trade_1922": " \nTHE FOREIGN TRADE CONTROVERSY \nThe first object of his wrath was the proposal, first made by Vladimir \nMilyutin who until then had been close to Lenin in his thinking, to \nrepeal the state monopoly on foreign trade which had been introduced \non 22 April 1918. Milyutin, as \nSoviet representative at the Baltic economic talks in the Latvian capital \nof Riga in late October 1921, learned how reluctant were foreign \n 264 \nLenin: A Political Life \nentrepreneurs to do their deals only with the Soviet government; and he \nfound support from Kamenev for the idea that, if imports of private \nforeign capital were to be allowed through the projected concessions, \nthere were no ideological or practical reasons for prohibiting private \nimport and export of goods. The People's Commissariat of Foreign \nTrade was criticised for its inefficiencies. Trotski argued \nthat all foreign trade should be placed under the authority of the State \nPlanning Commission so that the revenues from import and exports \ncould be channelled directly into industrial capital investment. \nThe Central Committee was to consider the premises of foreign trade \non 18 December. \nThe struggle over foreign-trade policy continued to exercise the minds \nof the Bolshevik leaders.", "Stalin_1922": " And it was Lenin, despite his recurrent calls to \nhis leading comrades to stick together and avoid dispute, who \ninstigated the greatest controversies in the second half of 1922. \nLenin's illness reduced the chances for differences of opinion \nremaining amicable in the Politburo.10 \nLenin had always been attentive about his health.'14 \nLenin was alarmed. He despised Rabkrin as well as its \nchairman Stalin; he also reasoned against Lenin that the proposal in \ngeneral depended excessively on amicable relations existing between \nRykov and Tsyurupa. Not \neven his stroke on 25 May 1922 changed his attitude, and Lenin was \ndetermined to resume his full duties with all speed. The Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic's most \nreluctant f.30 \nThere was another potential diagnosis which the Politburo withheld \nfrom public deliberations: namely that Lenin had syphilis.37 This perfectly characterised Lenin's circumstances.39 Lenin's policies of \nspring 1922 were savage even by his standards. Nikolai Valentinov, who had known the \nBolshevik leader in Switzerland, was impressed by the similarity \nbetween his own memory of the Lenin at the turn of the century and \nthe memoirs by Bolshevik leaders about the Lenin who had suffered a \nmajor stroke.43 Lenin, \nwhile not denying that the Commissariat was highly bureaucratic, was \nappalled by talk of denationalisation.45 \nBy early March 1922 he had appeared to have won;46 but already on \n15 May he was worried enough to write to Stalin as General Secretary \nof the Central Committee requesting the Politburo's approval for a \ndirective confirming the monopoly. The \nPolitburo accepted Lenin's request on 22 May - only three days \nbefore his major stroke.48 \nYet Kamenev and Bukharin were unpersuaded by his arguments; \nand even Stalin, who agreed to the issuance of the directive, had come \nto believe that 'a weakening of the monopoly would become inevitable' \n(as he remarked on his copy of Lenin's letter). Lenin, however, did not make this inference.\" Lenin could not attend the plenum, but \ncontacted participants including Stalin and Trotski.s7 Stalin was by then entirely on the side of Milyutin and \nSokolnikov; and not only Kamenev but also Zinoviev and Bukharin \nwere firmly convinced that 'the Old Man' had got it wrong and that the \neconomy's desperate condition necessitated the repeal.s8 But Stalin led \nthe way by telling the Central Committee, as its General Secretary, that \nhe was willing to retreat in the face of Lenin's 'insistent proposal'. Only Krasin, whose objections were now circulated to all Central \nCommittee members with Stalin's consent, backed him. On 12 \nOctober 1922 he had participated directly in a Politburo session.64 A week later he \nspoke to the Moscow Soviet.'77 The \nreactions of the other Politburo members can well be imagined. \nLenin had turned the tables on them. Control, control, \ncontro11711 On 15 December Lenin, pleased with his work, wrote to \nStalin and emphasised that his own absence should not be allowed to \ndeflect the Central Committee from a final decision on foreign trade: 'I \nhave now completed the winding up of my affairs and can calmly \ndepart.'80 \nFRIENDS AND COMRADES \nThe formation of the Lenin-Trotski alliance confounded the hopes of \nStalin and Zinoviev of excising Trotski from the core of the central \nparty leadership. \nTrotski had been highly suspect to Lenin since the 'trade union \ncontroversy', and Stalin had been among Lenin's most valuable \nsupporters in limiting the influence of the party's left wing.81 \nLenin's health problems in the winter of 1921-1922 had pushed him \ncloser and closer to Stalin. Vyacheslav Molotov was \npolitically more reliable for Lenin than his trio of predecessors: \nKrestinski, Serebryakov and Preobrazhenski.82 \nLenin needed a new Sverdlov, and he thought Stalin would fit the bill \ndespite the unsettled relations between them in the past. Before the \nFebruary Revolution Lenin, despite describing him as 'the wonderful \nGeorgian',83 had conflicted with him over the State Duma, over the \nparty's agrarian policy, over relations with the Mensheviks; and in \n1917 Stalin had not initially welcomed The April Theses or the call by \nLenin, after the 'July Days', to drop the slogan of 'All Power to the \nSoviets'. Lenin and Stalin differed about the prospects of \nEuropean socialist revolution, about the employment of Imperial \nofficers in the Red Army and about the 'national question'. In 1920, \nmoreover, Lenin had objected to the maverick behaviour of Stalin in \nthe Red Army's invasion of Poland. 85 \nConsequently it is erroneous to suppose that Lenin was entirely \nignorant about the kind of politician whose candidacy for appointment \nas General Secretary of the Central Committee he accepted after the \nEleventh Party Congress.86 In any case, bad blood had not come \nbetween Lenin and Stalin; as yet their disputes had been kept within the \nbounds of a party which thrived on polemics. Stalin had never been a \nyes-man; he had always been prickly, volatile and rumbustious; he had \nthe reputation of an administrator who could impose his will upon any \nrecalcitrant organisation. Stalin as General Secretary \nstood high above them. He was already a Politburo member (whereas \n 270 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMolotov had only even become a candidate member when selected as \n'responsible secretary'). Nevertheless the very authoritarian qualities \nwhich commended Stalin to his allies were uncongenial to others.89 \nThere was also concern lest Stalin's multiple tenure of posts in party \nand government should impede his ability to handle any one of them. On Lenin's initiative, Stalin was asked to find himself \ncompetent deputies for his jobs in government.91 This was not the \nsuggestion of someone who opposed Stalin's appointment. Not only Stalin but also the \nother secretaries should devote themselves to internal party affairs, and \nthe schedule of the Secretariat's opening hours should be fixed and \nadvertised.92 \nAt first Lenin and Stalin worked enjoyably together. Despite \nyearning to get back to the Kremlin and resume participation in \nPolitburo and Sovnarkom meetings, Lenin kept his frustrations in \ncheck most of the time. \nIn particular, his aim was to avoid offending Stalin, whom he had \nleft ofT his proposed list of members for the diminished Central \nCommittee:95 tantrums could not be afforded. Lenin liaised by phone \nand letter with Stalin. For his part, Stalin saw the sense in travelling out \nto Gorki for direct consultations. He wished to allay any suspicion \nharboured by Lenin that the Politburo was doing things which, if he \nhad been fit, would have incurred Lenin's displeasure. No Bolshevik \nleader saw Lenin in summer 1922 more than did Stalin.98 \nStalin cut a jovial figure with Lenin out at Gorki; he was an excellent \nmimic and raconteur when the mood was upon him, and cracked jokes \nwhile they discussed politics.99 Lenin put Stalin at his ease. When \nknowing that the General Secretary was about to arrive, he would \nquietly request his sister Mariya to place a bottle of wine at Stalin's \ndisposal. When Lenin suggested that \npolice surveillance should be instituted on his doctors, Stalin took this \n 272 \nLenin: A Political Life \nas the sign of a return to health. 100 There was no Politburo member \nmore vigilant for conspiracy and sabotage than Stalin, who was \ndelighted to find a congenial spirit in Lenin. \nThe only notable discomfiture in the conversations between Lenin \nand Stalin was not of Stalin's making. Lenin, frequently despairing of \nmaking a full recovery, asked Stalin for poison. Krupskaya and Lenin had \ntalked about this at the time. Instead he turned to Stalin. 102 Stalin agreed to \ndo his bidding. 103 So much for the idea that the scales tumbled from \nLenin's eyes as regards Stalin's personality only at the very end of 19221 \nAnother conversation proved how hard the Georgian Bolshevik really \nwas. Now Lenin heard that his former \ncomrade was ill and destitute in Berlin, and asked Stalin as General \nSecretary to see that financial assistance was dispatched to him. Stalin \nimmediately retorted: 'What, start wasting money on an enemy of the \nworking class.' Lenin was \nboth distraught and angry at such an attitude; but it was this attitude \nthat made Stalin the man who would be most likely to indulge the \nrequest for the capsule of cyanide.104 \nAnd yet even Stalin was unsure of himself. Their firm response was that Stalin should retract \nhis promise. Stalin agreed, and he returned to Lenin and fibbed that he \nhad consulted the doctors again and had been told that 'all was not \n Testament to a Revolution \n273 \nlost'. Stalin answered with a question of his own: 'When have you \nseen me being cunning.' 106 \nNaturally Lenin had seen many displays of cunning from Stalin over \nthe years; their joint machinations in the Bolshevik faction before 1917 \nand in the Soviet government after the October Revolution can have \nleft him with few illusions. Stalin and he \ntalked often about the political threat posed by Trotski. 107 It is hard to \nresist the conclusion that Lenin stilt believed that he could use Stalin as \nhis trusty adjutant. Privately he was condescending about his Georgian \ncolleague; and, when Mariya Ulyanova drew attention to Stalin's \ncleverness, Lenin the ex-emigre writer and theorist stupidly replied: 'He \nis far from being intetligent.'108 Such a misperception of Stalin's mental \ncapacities was common enough to the intellectuals of Bolshevism. The \nhumiliation felt by Stalin reinforced his determination to wreak a \nterrible revenge on them when the opportunity came. He himself had \nalways had ambitions as a theorist as well as an administrator, and \nevidently thought his writings on the national question to be a \nsubstantial contribution to a growing revolutionary corpus; and, while \nStalin could not match the flashes of inspiration in the humanities and \nthe social sciences displayed by Trotski and Bukharin, there is little in \nthe work of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Pyatakov or any other outstanding \nBolshevik politician which put them out of his intellectual class. And, \nquite apart from Stalin's qualities as a theorist, it was fatuous for Lenin \nto refer to him so casually as unintelligent. \nLenin's overt friendliness to Stalin was anyway predicated upon \nneed. Without Stalin, he could not control Trotski. But the disputes \nwith Stalin over policies on foreign trade and on other matters reversed \nthe situation: Trotski was needed in order to control the ever more \nrampant Stalin. 109 The foreign-trade controversy, moreover, had shown \nZinoviev and Kamenev to have come close to Stalin politically. 110 \nKamenev's refusal to pick up the anti-Stalin banner was the final \ninducement for Lenin to turn towards Trotski. The \nPolitburo's need in 1921 had been to implement the New Economic \nPolicy and to secure political control, but the inter-republican \nconstitutional problem could not be permanently ignored; and Lenin \nand Stalin remained as divided as in 1920 about the shape of the future \nlinks among all the Soviet republics from the Arctic to the Black Sea. To Lenin, \n Testament to a Revolution \n275 \nthis showed the correctness of his project for a multirepublican \nfederation; to Stalin, it demonstrated the opposite: namely that Soviet \nrule would be in danger unless the various republics were pulled \ndirectly into the RSFSR and subjected to tighter control. Remembering Lenin's call for sensitivity to \nbe shown by the party and the armed forces after Georgia's conquest, \nthey wrote to him in supplication. If Stalin was impervious to their \npleas, then surely Lenin would help them. \nBut Lenin proved, to their astonishment, to be as unsympathetic; the \nperson who in 1921 had intimated a willingness for a rapprochement \nbetween Bolshevism and Menshevism in Georgia turned a deaf ear to \nthem. 116 Both Lenin and Stalin were suspicious of Azeri, Armenian \nand Georgian nationalism. 118 \nNot even Lenin was yet disposed to take much notice of Budu \nMdivani's accusations of Muscovite persecution when Sergo Orzhoni-\nkidze and Stalin came forward with a proposal for a Transcaucasian \nfederation. Mikhail Frunze, deputy chairman of the \nUkrainian government, chafed against the limitations on his powers \nbecause of the Russo-Ukrainian treaty worked out in December 1920, \nand demanded a review of the treaty and its implementation at the \nPolitburo meeting of 4 May 1922. 120 A week later the Politburo \nestablished a commission to investigate the issues; its chairman was to \n 276 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbe Frunze. 123 \nThe urgency of the need for a general constitutional settlement at last \nbecome obvious to every Politburo member; and, from Lenin's \nviewpoint, the timing could not have been worse. \nWorse still, he was not immediately aware that Stalin was sticking \nmilitantly to his own proposals. His information about Moscow politicking came to \nhim to a considerable extent through Stalin. Furthermore, Stalin \ninitially did not seem as uncompromising as he later appeared. For his part, Stalin avoided controversy for \nas long as possible. There is no sign that Stalin's 'autonomisation' \nproject was discussed by Lenin and Stalin at the Gorki sanatorium in \nthe summer. The result was that, despite their vehement disagreement \nin 1920, Lenin remained confident that Stalin would yield to him: only \ngradually did he conclude that the General Secretary was not only \nintransigent but even devious on the matter.' 24 Stalin was the \nOrgburo's most influential figure, and the decision to leave the \ncomposition of a drafting commission in the hands of the Orgburo was \nalmost certainly a device to secrete the decisions away from Lenin. 125 \nThe Orgburo met on II August and set up a commission consisting \nof a representative from each of the republics as well as the following \ncentrally-based leaders: Stalin, V. 126 Stalin was deputed to write a \nproject for its perusal. Stalin's project was briskly to the point: he judged it \n'sensible' for the so-called independent republics to be subsumed within \nthe existing Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic. 129 \nThe decks were cleared for a struggle between Lenin and Stalin; and \nStalin, quite apart from having the advantage of being fit and active, \nfelt that he had reason on his side and that the party would support \nhim. The memory of Lenin's difficulties on the 'national question' in \n1917-1919,130 when Stalin had been mainly on his side, reinforced \nStalin's intuition that Lenin would lose this time. Stalin had always \nbeen a centraliser and a politician who had regarded the concessions to \nnationalism in the Civil War as an involuntary indulgence, or, as he put \nit, mere 'liberalism'. 132 \nAll seemed to go well for Stalin at first. 134 But things were \nalready unravelling for Stalin. The Georgian Central Committee had \nriled the Transcaucasian Regional Committee and its leader Ordzho-\nnikidze by rejecting Stalin's scheme on 15 September. 136 \nEven the Armenian party was less than ecstatic about Stalin's \nproposals, asking that the republics should explicitly be accorded \n'broad autonomy' within the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic \nand that time should be set aside to prepare the population for what \nwas to happen. 137 Meanwhile the Belorussian Central Committee \n 278 \nLenin: A Political Life \nevasively called for a constitutional settlement on the basis 'analogous \nto the relations established between the RSFSR and the Ukraine'.138 \nThis was not the open support expected by Stalin. Nor were they re-assured by private \ncontacts with Stalin, who denied the need for a code of political rights \nfor the republics. 140 \nStalin's troubles worsened as Lenin intervened on the side of the \nobjectors. Stalin was worried enough to write to him in self-\njustification on 22 September, explaining that the existing system of \ngovernance was really in 'sheer chaos'. Warming to his theme, Stalin asserted that \nnationalism in the peripheral areas would become a threat to the \nregime unless stern measures were quickly taken. 141 \nLenin had apparently been left little time to influence matters. The \nOrgburo commission meanwhile met on 23 September and accepted \nStalin's project as a basis for further discussion; the dissentient voices \nfrom the non-Russian republics were cowed into silence. \nPetrovski from the Ukraine was similarly unhappy, and Armenia's \nrepresentative Lukashin was disconcerted by Stalin's brusqueness \nabout the rights of the republics in the future federal order. 143 It was at \nthis point that Lenin came back into the reckoning. He talked with \nSokolnikov on 25 September and with Stalin himself for over two \nhours the next day. 144 Stalin was pulled up short. Lenin agreed with the charge \nthat Stalin was pressing the accelerator too hard. 145 \nBut Stalin proved to be slippery. Equally disruptive \nwas Stalin's letter to the Politburo on 27 September objecting to the \nestablishment of separate legislative organs for the Union of Soviet \nRepublics and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic: a clear \nattempt to re-introduce his old project by the back door. 147 \nIf Stalin underestimated Lenin's determination, others did not. At \nthe Politburo on 28 September, Kamenev warned Stalin by memo: \n'IIich has girded himself up for war in defence of independence.'148 \nStalin was undismayed: 'What is required, in my view, is firmness \nagainst Ilich. Lenin would see to that. Taken slightly aback, \nStalin scribbled: 'I don't know. 153 Nevertheless Stalin \nhad made the necessary modifications to his project, giving ground on \nthe question of separating of Union and Russian administrative \norgans. \nThe members included Stalin, Kamenev, Pyatakov, Rykov, Chicherin \n 280 \nLenin: A Political Life \nand Kalinin as well as representatives from each of the non-Russian \nrepublics. 154 \nStalin in any case saw that Lenin was not properly recovered. (In \nfact he became a lot more agitated because of this plot of gentility \nagainst himl)155 Stalin also knew that the Georgian Bolshevik leaders' \nhostility to being included in a Transcaucasian federation still cut no \nice with Lenin. \nStalin's ally Beso Lominadze was sent by him from Petrograd to \nbecome Georgian Central Committee secretary. 157 At a meeting of the Transcaucasian \nRegional Committee of the Bolshevik party, Ordzhonikidze referred to \nthem as 'chauvinistic filth' . 159 Stalin enjoyed himself, calling \non Ordzhonikidze to 'punish' the Georgian Central Committee by \ntransferring its recalcitrant members to posts outside Georgia. 162 A new Georgian Central Commmittee was \nappointed from Moscow on 24 October.164 As yet Lenin, \nwhile not liking Stalin's attitudes, thought that his actions were \njustified. And Stalin showed his guile by acceding to the demand of the \nGeorgian Bolshevik dissenters for an investigative mission to be sent to \nTbilisi. Manuilski: hardly an \nimprovement since Manuilski had already helped to stiffen Stalin's \nresolve against making concessions to the so-called nationalists. 167 A \nwhitewashing job was being set up in favour of Stalin and \nOrdzhonikidze. The dissentient Georgian Bolsheviks nervously \nawaited their fate. They proclaimed that Stalin was blind to the fact \n Testament to a Revolution \n281 \nthat Bolshevism had only the most slender support among Georgians \nin general, that Georgia had had to be conquered and that undying \nnational enmity towards Moscow would result from Stalin's constitu-\ntional project. \nA small incident in the Georgian capital in late November 1922 \nchanged the balance of political forces. Rykov, one of Lenin's \ndeputies in Sovnarkom, was convalescing there and had Ordzhonikidze \nand Kobachidze, a Mdivani supporter, round for the evening as guests.168 This was a taunt that Stalin's ally was behaving with \nthe arrogance of a satrap. 169 \nLenin in Moscow was beginning anyway to see the need to keep an \neye on Stalin.172 Lenin was appalled.' 176 \n 282 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it was too late to stop the formation of a Union (which was now \nto be called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) on the principles \nestablished with Lenin's consent before the dispatch of Dzierzynski to \nGeorgia. A Congress of Soviets in the Transcausasus had overruled the \nobjections of the Georgian dissenters; and the Central Committee in \nMoscow on 18 December, welcoming the report of its constitutional \ncommission under Stalin, set up yet another for the business of final \nediting. Fittingly it was Stalin who presented \nit for approval to the First AU-Union Congress of Soviets on 30 \nDecember l 922. The Georgian Bolsheviks had \nbeen defeated. Ordzhonikidze had got away with his outrageous \nbehaviour and Stalin had manoeuvred the Central Committee towards \na result which, while not giving him exactly what he had originally \ndesired, was satisfactory to him. It was the greatest political setback for \nLenin in his party since before the February Revolution of 1917. \n'LETTER TO THE CONGRESS' \nThe abrupt worsening of Lenin's condition on 13 December 1922 \nquickened his awareness that he might soon die, and unflinchingly he \npondered how best to arrange the political succession. \nThe only leader who could broach the question was Vladimir Ilich \nLenin himself, and it was typical of his tough-mindedness that he \ndetermined to do so. His main worry was the \ndurability of the party's rule over society in a world of states hostile to \nthe Soviet republic. Trotski was the renowned co-instigator \nof the October Revolution, Zinoviev headed the Executive Committee \nof the Communist International and Kamenev was chairman of the \nMoscow Soviet. All three were also Politburo members and constantly \nin the public eye. More acute still was the \nimportance he attached to the sixth leader on his list: Stalin. Few \nBolsheviks outside the Politburo membership would have judged him \nto be any more worthy of inclusion than Pyatakov. Stalin, moreover, was thought to lack \ncompetence as a theorist - a major failing in a Bolshevik leader of that \nepoch. Lenin not only included him but also contended that a clash \nbetween Stalin and Trotski, 'the two outstanding leaders of the present-\nday Central Committee', could even 'lead inadvertently to a schism' in \nthe party. A party split, he asserted, was the greatest threat to the \nsurvival of the Soviet republic. \n'Comrade Stalin, having become General Secretary, has concentrated \nboundless power in his hands,' he noted, 'and I am not convinced that \nhe will always manage to use this power with sufficient care. Lenin tendentiously \nrecorded, too, that Trotski's behaviour in the trade union controversy \nof 1920-1921 showed an intolerable inclination towards a defiance of \nthe Central Committee (as if Lenin had never committed the same \nsupposed misdemeanour). But the alternative, \nwhich was to have Trotski or Stalin alone at the helm, appeared to him \neven worse. This was obvious in Lenin's recent letters seeking an \nalliance with him on questions of the day where Stalin stood in his way. Trotski was not to be the new \nLenin. 188 He had mentioned Trotski's excessive 'self-\nconfidence' (again without sign of sensing how easily the description \n 286 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfitted him too).' 189 \nThis cumbersome remark was meant to indicate that Trotski and \nStalin might eventually find themselves on opposing sides in a dispute \nabout the rival claims on the party's favour on behalf of the working \nclass and the peasants.' 190 In fact a conflict between \nTrotski and Stalin over the pace of industrialisation and over the \nrespective interests of the workers and the peasants broke out quickly \nafter Lenin's death. 191 Lenin got the substance right, but the timing \nwrong. The plenum resolved to remove \nLenin from all connection with active politics for the duration of his \nillness, and devolved upon Stalin an 'individual responsibility for \nVladimir Ilich's isolation as regards both personal relations with \nofficials [of the party: R. Lenin reeked nought of this. 198 But Stalin was mightily \ndispleased in himself and, on 22 December, picked up the phone to \nKrupskaya. Stalin \nretorted that she would die all the sooner. 199 Even so, Krupskaya had \nnever been the butt of his foul tongue; and she was offended by the \nobscenities he uttered on learning about the infringement of the Central \nCommittee's interdiction on communication between Lenin and other \nleaders without Stalin's sanction. '201 Krupskaya kept the incident secret from Lenin, \nhowever, on the grounds that he might be upset. And, in purely formal terms, she presumably \ncould see that her action had indeed infringed a Central Committee \ndecision putting Stalin in charge of Lenin's isolation and convales-\ncence. \n 288 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThat Stalin could have lost his own self-control to the extent of bad-\nmouthing his leader's wife and comrade is remarkable. Perhaps he judged that 'Lenin is kaput' . She claimed that the aggravation \nof his medical condition induced him to approach Stalin yet again for a \nphial of poison.2\u00b03 Stalin could have had no more vivid sign that \nLenin's energies were fading. But he also knew about Lenin's resilience. Lenin was still a dangerous and important \npiece on the chess-board. It could well be that Stalin's growing \nconfidence was matched by a sharpening sense of exasperation, and \nthat the pressures upon him became ungovernable, just for a moment, \non 22 December. The message dictated by Lenin to Krupskaya, which \nwas the goad for Stalin's outburst, had been a request to Trotski to act \nas his ally in the Politburo conflict.204 Such a coalition, even with Lenin \non his sickbed and operating at a small fraction of his normal capacity, \nwas a threat to Stalin's continuing advance on power. \nStalin was put directly on guard on 23 December by a conversation \nwith Mariya Volodicheva. This did not mention Stalin by name; but it \ncounselled structural change in the central party organs as well as \nrecommending that Trotski's ideas on economic planning should be \nwelcomed by the party.205 Lenin evidently was intent on some political \nreform, and no one had more to lose from this than Stalin.207 Fotieva, who was an admirer of \nStalin, advised her to show it to him. Going round to his flat, she came \nupon Stalin in conclave with Ordzhonikidze, Bukharin and A. \nAfter a few minutes they re-emerged and Stalin, whose hands hung \nheavy by his side, told her directly: 'Burn it. She revealed it to Stalin precisely \non the grounds that a secret anti-Stalin ploy was in hand.211 Stalin hoped to cut off his \npotential for interference at its tap-root. The \nSoviet leader, hated by his enemies at home and abroad as the Red \ndictator, did not take easily to dictation of the literary kind. But \nher colleagues, Lidiya Fotieva and Mariya Glyasser, also took turns in \nthe busy last week of December 1922 when the Congress of Soviets was \nin session.216 \n 290 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBut it is a moot point whether they stayed loyal to his command. \nThey had already run to Stalin, already lied to Lenin, already shown \nthey knew what was at stake. In their later lives they were wiJiing \npolitical handmaidens unto Stalin; and there is definite evidence that at \nleast Glyasser took an anti-Trotski position in the controversies of \n1923.218 \nNothing can yet be proved, but it would not be totally surprising if \nthese young women, squeezed in a vice of contrary loyalties and \nsensing that Lenin would not last much longer, continued to yield \ninformation to Stalin.", "Stalin_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. Generations of Stalin's enemies took this as \nproof positive that he indeed betrayed true Leninism. \nStalin and his cronies liquidated their rivals and organised a bloodbath \nwhich drowned millions before it was blocked up. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. They had a subtler view on the \nmodes and substance of revolutionary strategy than the crude Stalin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. Bukharin was destined to fall out politically with Stalin in the \nlate 1920s when Stalin began to oppose the New Economic Policy; and \nBukharin naturally did not fail to suggest that Bukharin and Lenin had \nbeen at one in contending that a complete absence of force was both \ndesirable and possible. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. To be sure, he had confided in his own notebooks \nin November 1922 that he expected the revolutionary advance of the \nsecond half-decade of Soviet power to be 'slower' than in the first half-\ndecade. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922.9 This argument, flimsy as it was, posed yet another threat \nto Stalin's position since he was the Inspectorate's chairman. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. 18 The \nGeneral Secretary's cunning in sending a non-Russian, Dzierzynski, \nto investigate the Georgian Bolshevik Central Committee's grievances \ndid not escape his notice. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. He demanded the \nexemplary punishment of Ordzhonikidze, the reconsideration of the \nmaterials in the Dzierzynski report and the holding of Stalin and \nDzierzynski as 'politically responsible for this entire truly Great \nRussian nationalistic campaign'.21 Stalin had already been singled out \nfor concern in the earliest sections of the 'Letter to the Congress', but \nthe nature of the menace to him remained unclear. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. She listened in awe as he added a codicil: 'Stalin is \ntoo crude, and this inadequacy, which is wholly acceptable in our \nmilieu and in exchanges among us communists, becomes intolerable in \nthe post of General Secretary. I therefore urge comrades to think of a \nmethod for transferring Stalin from this position and to appoint \nanother person to this position who in all other respects differs from \ncomrade Stalin through the one advantage [i. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority).30 All that is \ncertain is that Lenin wanted to prevent Stalin from realising his \npotential to become the dominant Bolshevik leader; it is not even clear \nthat Stalin in Lenin's intention would be excluded from the Central \nCommittee.31 But Stalin's agility in protecting himself makes them not \nentirely plausible. In any case Stalin must have gauged the hostility of \nLenin towards him from the first section of the 'Letter' as revealed to \nhim by Volodicheva, and the contents of the Pravda articles can have \nleft no doubt in Stalin's mind. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. But another article, 'How We Should \nReorganise Rabkrin', was quickly put into the press despite touching \nStalin's vital interests. The first draft had been even more pointedly hostile to Stalin.53 This was close to revealing that political \ndisputes and personal rivalries existed at the apex of the party, and it \nwould have rightly been taken to be an attack on Stalin. Lenin acceded \nto editorial alteration; perhaps he anyway judged it inappropriate to \ngive Stalin an early warning of his intentions about him (even though \nStalin may well have already known through his secretarial helpers. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. \nThus would the Soviet Union endure until the times became propitious \nfor the worldwide socialist revolution. Pravda printed his \npiece on 4 March 1923.66 \nBREAKING WITH STALIN \nStalin was troubled by what he knew of Lenin's intentions, and the \nlatest articles alarmed him.' But Lenin scoffed at Stalin's words as relayed by his sister, and \nonly at her insistence did he coolly consent to return Stalin's greeting. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got.71 His ability to dictate articles gave him an influence on the \nsituation in the Politburo. Stalin saw the need for a certain \ncompromise. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission).73 \nStalin may even have anticipated this and wanted to have \nammunition to fire at Trotski as being very arrogant. He also did \nhimself no favours by remaining scrupulously silent about the \nsurreptitious misbehaviour of Stalin and other Central Committee \nmembers. Unlike Lenin, he did not \ntake seriously the threat from Stalin.76 \nLenin had to act fast. Stalin's determination to have his way in the \nGeorgian affair was undiminished. Dzierzynski's report on his visit to \nTbilisi in the previous December was approved by the Orgburo on 13 \nJanuary 1923 and passed on to the Politburo.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling.78 The Politburo \nmembers met on 24 January. Stalin's colleague \nin the Secretariat, Valeryan Kuibyshev, suggested a plan to deceive the \n'Old Man'.80 \nFotieva was asked to request permission for the relevant documents on \nGeorgia to be released for the group's inspection - Lenin knew that \nneither Stalin nor the doctors would allow him to examine them \ndirectly himself. Fotieva and Glyasser were \nas thick as thieves and devoted to Stalin. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski.81 Only \nGorbunov was unlinked to Stalin. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed.82 \nHaving sanctioned Pravda's publication of 'How We Should \nReorganise Rabkrin', the ascendant leaders in the Politburo \npanicked. It was signed \nnot only by Stalin and Kamenev but also by Trotski.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities. At last he was ready to go \nto war on Stalin. \nKrupskaya accidentally blurted out the details of Stalin's behaviour \non the night of 22 December 1922. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. He wrote to Stalin as follows: 'You had the rudeness to \ncall my wife to the telephone and use foul language on her.90 Trotski was urged, too, to contact \nKamenev, who was not at one with Stalin in the matter and was about \nto depart for the Georgian Communist Party Congress. I'm upset at the crudity of Ordzhonikidze and \nthe connivances of Stalin and Dzierzynski.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. Volodicheva went out on her errand to Stalin's office.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. How Stalin must have \nregretted that he had not handed the 'Old Man' the cyanide phial. He and Mariya Ulyanova had a \nblazing row by phone: Stalin was adding to the hurts to Lenin's pride \nwhich would have cost Stalin dearly in due time. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. Many had \nbecome his political enemies: Pavel Akselrod, Aleksandr Bogdanov, \nYuli Martov and Aleksandr Potresov. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Skvortsov-Stepanov, Nikolai \nKrestinski, Osip Pyatnitski and others. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. A stay of his proposed punishment of Stalin was the \nresult. Stalin meanwhile had a wonderful opportunity to prepare his \ndefence. Kamenev in particular \nhad withheld support from Stalin in the Georgian affair. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. 129 In addition, Stalin had been alerted to the need \nfor wariness. 130 \nStalin played cautiously at first. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. At the next meeting of the \nPolitburo, on 26 March, Stalin clashed with Trotski. Trotski had \nmade only the barest dent in Stalin's armour. Stalin enhanced his \nposition at the same plenum when he was seen to support Lenin's \nproposal for an increase in the number of Central Committee members \nwhereas Trotski argued against it. \nThen something happened which destroyed Stalin's equanimity. On \n16 April, Lidiya Fotieva returned to her duties after an absence over \nnearly three weeks and informed Stalin, Kamenev and Trotski that \nLenin had told her, shortly before his last attack, that he intended soon \nto publish the article on Georgia and the national question which he \nhad dictated on 31 December 1922}36 Both Kamenev and Trotski had \ndiscussed its contents. The danger for Stalin was that Lenin had not \nonly called for a re-orientation of policy on Georgia but also picked \nout Stalin for specific censure. 138 Stalin hit back by telling the \nCentral Committee that Trotski had misled the party by failing to \nreveal Lenin's article to the party in due time. 139 Trotski retorted that \nhe had had no knowledge that Lenin had wanted immediate \npublication, and Stalin backed down in conversation with him. 140 Stalin was \ngoing to brazen it out. He was assisted by the feeling of several party \nleaders, including Kamenev and Zinoviev, that Stalin's humiliation \nwould serve to elevate their dreaded rival Trotski to supreme power.142 This was not a \nmere slap on the wrist for Stalin; but it was short of being a body-blow. \nStalin also knew that, in Bolshevik debates on the national question in \nthe past, he himself had been closer to the core of his party's opinion \nthan had Lenin; and he continued to benefit from the fact that Lenin's \nrecommendation for the sacking of Stalin from the General Secretary-\nship was unknown to the rest of the Politburo. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. Stalin's speech on the \nnational question contained no apology for past misdeeds. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. \nStalin's bid to seem the loyal and trusted adjutant of Lenin continued \nas he presented Lenin's proposals for internal party re-organisation to \nthe Congress. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. Stalin took the \nlead in distorting Lenin's intentions as indicated in his last notes and \narticles. 150 \nStalin's increased power began to concern Kamenev and Zinoviev. It was \nhardly a conspiratorial affair since Kliment Voroshilov, closely linked \nwith Stalin, was present. Agreement was reached that Stalin's power \nover the Secretariat should be reduced by introducing others to its \nmembership. \nBut Stalin reacted subtly. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. Stalin was already \nelaborating extravagant projects. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. 156 Those present would seem to have \nincluded Stalin, Trotski, Kamenev, Bukharin, Kalinin and Rykov. Stalin suggested \nthat cremation would offend the sensibilities of most Russians. Stalin put this in such a way as to \nimply that he was only relaying a proposal coming from provincial \nparty leaders. Only Rykov and \nKalinin did not directly oppose Stalin, but even they failed to endorse \nhis plan unambiguously. But Stalin's insistence on \naddressing it showed that he was thinking in greater detail than was \nany rival about the scenario after Lenin's death. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. Trotski had missed chances to do \ndown Stalin which were not passed up by Stalin in his moves against \nTrotski. Stalin envied his popularity in the country, feared the \nresonance of his ideas among hundreds of party activists and opposed \n- at least at that time - his suggestion that the state should quickly \nintensify its intervention in industry, commerce and agriculture. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup. His support in provincial party \ncommittees was whittled down by the double barrage of Zinoviev's \narguments and Stalin's organisational manipulations. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. At the Thirteenth \nParty Conference in January 1924 his chances of breaking up the \nalliance of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev were blown to the winds. A \nsplit in the party, with Stalin and Trotski on opposing sides, was in the \nmaking; and Stalin consolidated his grasp on the Secretariat of the \nCentral Committee. The speed of Trotski's humiliation astounded even \nStalin's adherents. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "Major_Stroke_1922": " \nOn 25 May 1922 his difficulties almost became terminal when he \nsuffered a major stroke at Gorki. The stroke was a shock for everyone. 6 At the news of his major stroke, he could no longer sieve out \nwhat he wanted the doctors to know. It was four weeks after the \nstroke before Pravda carried a medical bulletin. No reference to a stroke was \nmade. His father had died of cerebral atherosclerosis in \n1886, and he must have surmised that the same fate might await him. The stroke of 25 May had been of major dimensions and, as \nProfessor Osipov indicated, had probably occurred at the end of a \nsequence of several lighter strokes. Nevertheless, \nwhile several hypotheses cannot be definitively repudiated, the evidence \non balance suggests that his principal affliction in mid-1922 is likely to \nhave been an hereditary weakness resulting in atherosclerosis. He \nhad had various medicaments for his symptoms, but the worsening \nsymptoms before 1921 had not been treated with the principal \nmeasures that might have prevented a stroke: a protracted rest and a \npermanent withdrawal from activities involving stress. Lenin's \naffected arteries were linked to the brain, and the major stroke was a \nsign that a worse one might yet occur. In particular, the hundreds of pages of accounts kept by his \ndoctors after his stroke contain information written within the \nframework of assumptions superseded by decades of clinical science's \ndevelopment.", "Implementation_1922": "212 But there was no other option in 1922.", "Decided_To_Accede_1923": " \nNor was there much new in his article 'On Co-operation', which was \ndictated and written up between 4 and 6 January 1923. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided.", "Divulge_Lenin_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. A question \nof the same order arises in connection with Lenin: would the history of \nthe USSR have been greatly different if premature illness had not \nended his life. \nIt is necessary to pause before proceeding to the dramatic last \nmonths of Lenin's career in order to take stock of the issues. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. Lenin had objected to several of Stalin's policies, and \ndemonstrably perceived these disagreements as constituting a basic \ndivergence over strategy. Generations of Stalin's enemies took this as \nproof positive that he indeed betrayed true Leninism. But Lenin's \njudgement is not reliable. These did not figure in the communications between Lenin \nand Stalin for the simple reason that they belonged to the zone of their \nshared and deeply-felt assumptions. Nothing said \nor done by the dying Lenin suggested that he had changed his mind on \nsuch fundamental essentials of post-October Leninism.2 \n291 \n 292 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe fact remains that the USSR suffered unbridled mass terror in the \nI 930s. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. We cannot be sure; but it is also improbable that the War \nCommunist methods used in the late I 920s to pulverise the peasantry \ninto submission and undertake the collectivisation of agriculture by \nmain force would have occurred to Lenin as a desirable project. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Nobody proclaimed Lenin's \nconstancy more loudly than that other great claimant to his mantle: \nLev Trotski. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought. In this he had to \nignore the commonalty of Lenin's and Stalin's ideas in several basic \nrespects. He also tried to indicate that, had he lived, Lenin would have \nespoused policies identical with Trotski's.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. But that Trotski, no less than Lenin and \nStalin, adhered to a common basic set of assumptions is undeniable. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. \nBukharin was to assert that, as they talked in the beautiful gardens \nand woods at Gorki, Lenin confided a novel idea of the possibilities of \na 'transition to socialism'.4 Lenin purportedly had come to believe that the local \npeasant community could be persuaded eventually to tum itself into a \ncollective farm and that this transformation, be it accomplished only at \na snail's pace, would be the decisive factor in the party's revolutionary \nstrategy. Thus it is proposed that Bukharinism was \nsimply the latest version of Leninism approved by Lenin in his own \nlifetime. And yet Lenin's plans for the New Economic Policy do not \nsustain the notion that he had switched to a fully evolutionary \nprognosis. Quite the contrary: his writings in 1922 include demands for \nincreased state economic intervention and for increased cultural and \nreligious repression; and at no point did he relent his suppression of \nother political parties. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. \nNot that Bukharin did not have his points of accord with Lenin in \nthis period. He supported Lenin's line on the national question; but he \nwas also opposed to Lenin in the foreign-trade dispute and had been \ncomplicit in the deception of Lenin when Mariya Volodicheva handed \nLenin's dictated notes to Stalin. Bukharin was his own man, and \ndiffered from Lenin on other basic questions of policy. While \nLenin's emphasis lay upon the introduction of literacy and account-\nkeeping, Bukharin looked forward to workers developing their own \ncultural practices and institutions to replace 'bourgeois' dominion in \nsocial thought.6 \nBolshevik leaders shared in politics more than they individually held \napart. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. It is not inconceivable that Bolshevik policies might \nhave been diverted on to a more peaceful, evolutionary path if the \nparty had been less centralised, if ordinary party members had had a \ngreater impact and if the brutalisation of politics in Russia had not \ngone to extraordinary lengths in the years immediately after the seizure \nof power in Petrograd. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. To be sure, he had confided in his own notebooks \nin November 1922 that he expected the revolutionary advance of the \nsecond half-decade of Soviet power to be 'slower' than in the first half-\ndecade. But privately he \nput it more starkly; for Lenin, the question was: 'Who leads.'8 Lenin the class warrior was \nnot politically defunct. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922. The Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate had not satisfactorily discharged the task of supervising \nand controlling its operations, and Lenin emphasised that the \nintroduction of workers to the Central Committee would improve \n Deaths and Entrances \n295 \nthe situation. 10 Lenin's similar criticism \nindicated that Trotski and he were drawing together. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. 18 The \nGeneral Secretary's cunning in sending a non-Russian, Dzierzynski, \nto investigate the Georgian Bolshevik Central Committee's grievances \ndid not escape his notice. According to Lenin, the Pole had displayed 'a \ntruly Russian attitude'. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. \nLenin had also asserted that only the People's Commissariat of \nExternal Affairs was reliably devoid of influential figures from the old \nregime; and yet he failed to prescribe a remedy. Possibly he was already \nagitated by yet another matter: namely what to do about the \npersecutors of the Georgian Bolshevik leadership. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation. This was that Bolsheviks, while \nkeeping the USSR in existence, should accept that the plans for \nconstitutional integration might have to be dropped. He was at pains to affirm that he did not \ncontemplate the USSR's disintegration. He mentioned that the \nBolshevik-led republics would stay under general party discipline, \nand that any breakdown in co-ordination 'between Moscow and the \nother centres can be paralysed by party authority'.24 Lenin's passion was \ndistinct in every line, and this final political campaign was being \nmounted by a very determined 'Old Man'.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. I therefore urge comrades to think of a \nmethod for transferring Stalin from this position and to appoint \nanother person to this position who in all other respects differs from \ncomrade Stalin through the one advantage [i. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. Lenin guessed that he \nmight not have put a fully cogent case, and added: 'This circumstance \nmay appear an irrelevant triviality. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority).30 All that is \ncertain is that Lenin wanted to prevent Stalin from realising his \npotential to become the dominant Bolshevik leader; it is not even clear \nthat Stalin in Lenin's intention would be excluded from the Central \nCommittee. \nWith remarkable tenacity the sick Lenin meanwhile produced \narticles in abundance for Pravda. It cannot be demonstrated that \nFotieva conveyed the latest pieces from his 'Letter to the Congress' to \nStalin; it is also conceivable that Stalin did not importune her for \nfurther reports on the direction of Lenin's thought: both of these are \npossibilities. In any case Stalin must have gauged the hostility of \nLenin towards him from the first section of the 'Letter' as revealed to \nhim by Volodicheva, and the contents of the Pravda articles can have \nleft no doubt in Stalin's mind. It centred on a \n1920 survey of literacy in Russia. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). Lenin, \nunder his wife's influence, acknowledged that 'a new posing of \nquestions of pedagogy' was desirable; but apparently this would \nmainly involve a reconsideration of the treatment of religion in the \nschools; and he urged that propagandists should emphasise the \nallegation that Jesus Christ had never lived.33 \n Deaths and Entrances \n299 \nNothing in these considerations was at variance with Lenin's previous \nwritings. The \ndifference now, he declared, was that the state was not bourgeois but \nsocialist.36 Inverted commas embraced the adjective: Lenin sensed that \nits usage bore a resemblance to the kind of remark made by Victorian \ncapitalist philanthropists. Lenin's article called only for a shift \nin the emphasis of policies; it did not include a recognition that it had \nbeen wrong to make the October Revolution 'in an inadequately \ncultured country'. After all, his wife \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nGalina had put their flat at the disposal of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee on 10 October 1917 when the decision to seize power had \nbeen taken.40 Menshevism had traditionally adhered to the principle \nthat, until capitalism had reached economic and cultural maturity in a \ngiven country, it would be dangerous and futile to inaugurate 'the \ntransition to communism'; and this continued to be Sukhanov's \nobjection to Bolshevik strategy. \nLenin postulated that Sukhanov displayed 'the pedantry of all our \npetit-bourgeois democrats'. There were bound to be 'several partial novelties' in the \nestablishment of socialism under the Bolsheviks. \nLenin freely conceded that, in Marxist terminology, the level of \n'development of the productive forces' was too low for the immediate \ninception of socialism in Russia.42 But he appended a question: 'If the \ncreation of socialism demands a definite level of culture (although \nnobody can say precisely what is constituted by this definite \"level of \nculture\" since it is different in each of the West European states), why \ncan't we make our beginning by using revolutionary means for the \nconquest of the prerequisites for this definite level and only \nsubsequently, on the basis of worker-and-peasant power and the \nsoviet order, move onwards to catch up other peoples.'43 No question \nmark appeared at the end of the sentence, indicating that Lenin \nassumed that its contents were sufficiently self-evident to provoke no \ncontradiction. Before 1917 he, too, had assumed that socialism could not \nbe introduced before social and cultural prerequisites were satisfied; \nand between the February and October Revolutions he had avoided \nthe topic. What his article 'On Our Revolution' did was to give a \nretrospective legitimation to his strategy of October 1917.44 \nNapoleon Bonaparte's dictum was recalled by Lenin: 'On s'engage et \npuis . 46 \n Deaths and Entrances \n301 \nWithout directly saying so, he stressed the importance of luck and \ncontingency in giving the Bolsheviks their chance.'\" But Lenin felt fully confident intellectually only when his \nopinions were supportable by classic Marxist texts; and his usual \nmethod was to dredge up references to Marx and Engels or to his own \nearlier work. But his current emphasis on cultural backwardness, \ninternational political vulnerability and the Russian peasantry made it \ninappropriate to rehearse the citations in The State and Revolution.48 \nInstead Lenin adduced Marx's hope (as expressed in a letter of 1856) \nthat a dual revolt of workers and peasants might overthrow German \ncapitalism.49 The Bolsheviks in Lenin's view followed this tradition. To \nhis dying breath, he avoided recourse to Marx's favourable comments \non the Russian populists, who wanted to base a socialist society upon \nwhat they took to be the egalitarian practices and potential of the \npeasant village commune; he opposed agrarian socialism: his Marxism \ncontinued to hymn the virtues of workers, towns and large-scale \norganisation. Lenin remained true to himself to the end, and the \nequivocations of Marx himself in the last years of his life were \nignored. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, still \nhad him as its People's Commissar; and Lenin had complained about \nits efficiency. Lenin specified that not even the authority of the \nGeneral Secretary ought to get in the way of the Central Control \nCommission's interventions. \nLenin had originally called upon the Secretariat to be more efficient in \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nits preparation of materials for Politburo sessions. Lenin acceded \nto editorial alteration; perhaps he anyway judged it inappropriate to \ngive Stalin an early warning of his intentions about him (even though \nStalin may well have already known through his secretarial helpers. Much as had been done to promote \nworking-class people to administrative position in the Soviet state, he \ndeclared for the first time that such workers were 'insufficently \nenlightened'. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. There \nwere also signs of changes in social policy in the West which, by \nbettering material conditions, might serve to postpone the revolu-\n Deaths and Entrances \n303 \ntionary explosion predicted by Lenin since mid-1914. The \nproblem for the Bolsheviks and the Soviet state was to hold on long \nenough, and he definitively rejected the assumption that the transition \nto socialism in the USSR would be fast. But more \nlikely the entire political camp of capitalism would be distracted from \nan anti-Bolshevik crusade by struggles by their respective colonies for \nnationalliberation.63 \nThe Bolshevik party, hoping for this favourable outcome, should \nconcentrate on the maintenance of the supposed leadership by the \nworkers over the peasantry. \nThus would the Soviet Union endure until the times became propitious \nfor the worldwide socialist revolution.64 Lenin the visionary and the \ninspirer of his party declared that 'these are the great tasks I am \ndreaming about'.66 \nBREAKING WITH STALIN \nStalin was troubled by what he knew of Lenin's intentions, and the \nlatest articles alarmed him.' But Lenin scoffed at Stalin's words as relayed by his sister, and \nonly at her insistence did he coolly consent to return Stalin's greeting. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got.71 His ability to dictate articles gave him an influence on the \nsituation in the Politburo. While detesting Trotski, he recognised the danger that \nthe alliance between Lenin and Trotski might constitute. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission). Unlike Lenin, he did not \ntake seriously the threat from Stalin.76 \nLenin had to act fast.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling. The problem for them was that Lenin was \nwell enough to check whether his article was printed. A single copy of the newspaper including the article should \nbe printed for Lenin's benefit on 25 January. To have refused him would have required a unanimity in the \nPolitburo which did not exist. 79 \nLenin's authority as party leader had not vanished; and, while being \nworried by questions of state administration, he was pre-occupied by \nthe political business in Georgia.80 \nFotieva was asked to request permission for the relevant documents on \nGeorgia to be released for the group's inspection - Lenin knew that \nneither Stalin nor the doctors would allow him to examine them \ndirectly himself. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed. They deplored the suggestion by Lenin that, if preventive \nmeasures were not taken, a split in the central party leadership was a \ndistinct possibility.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. A strong hint was \ndropped that Lenin, divorced from participation in Politburo \ndiscussions, was not really au fait with current issues.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities. Thus, although permission was given on I \nFebruary for them to inspect the official materials at the basis of \nDzierzynski's report, Lenin had to accept that several weeks would be \nrequired for them to assess them properly.85 Lenin remonstrated with \nVolodicheva: 'Ifl had my freedom, I could easily do all this for myself. \nKrupskaya accidentally blurted out the details of Stalin's behaviour \non the night of 22 December 1922. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. '89 \nOn the same day he asked Trotski to take up the Georgian \nBolsheviks' case on his behalf.90 Trotski was urged, too, to contact \nKamenev, who was not at one with Stalin in the matter and was about \nto depart for the Georgian Communist Party Congress. Simultaneously Lenin was developing tactics with ever \ngreater confidence (even though his physical condition was worsening \nas a result of his mental agitation).93 All this was kept from Lenin as he \ndictated a note to Mdivani and Makharadze: 'With all my heart I am \nfollowing your cause.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. \nHe stood up as he read it, hardly able to believe his eyes: 'This isn't \nLenin who's talking, it's his illness. His note as deposited in Lenin's office referred to \nthe duty laid upon him to see that no political information reached \nLenin as he convalesced and to Krupskaya's infringements.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. But \ncringe before Lenin he would not. What saved him from \na goring by the bullish Lenin was nothing he did in his own defence but \nthe rapid decline in Lenin's health. But a \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmild, temporary improvement in May 1923 induced the doctors to \nstate that, so long as a specially-upholstered vehicle could be provided \nand driven at a slow pace, the patient should be transferred again to \nGorki. 103 Nadezhda \nKrupskaya and Mariya Ulyanova were in more or less constant \nattendance, and Krupskaya took lessons so as to be able to teach Lenin \nto speak. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. And, despite his \nenormous will-power, Lenin also wept profusely. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). Lenin's sudden collapses into \ntearfulness would now be considered a normal aspect of his medical \ncondition. The doctors treating Lenin were doing their best at \na time when the understanding of the brain was at a much lower level \n Deaths and Entrances \n309 \nthan today. Krupskaya had every right to be sceptical about the \ndoctors; and Lenin, remembering that his father had died of the same \nillness in his early fifties, had cause for his underlying pessimism. An appeal based on \nthe opportunity for work was the likeliest to get through to Lenin. This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. But she reckoned \nwithout Lenin's physical recuperation. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. None of them were Bolsheviks: Lenin had \na highly-developed contempt for those among his comrades who had \nqualified as doctors. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. Lenin's evident intention \nhad been to present his thoughts as dictated to Fotieva and \nVolodicheva in the preceding winter to the assembled delegates (even \nif someone else would have had to read them out aloud). This involved an attack on the one leader, apart from Lenin, \nwho was clearly hostile to him: Trotski. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. 129 In addition, Stalin had been alerted to the need \nfor wariness. Lenin's note demanding an apology to Krupskaya had \nput him on guard; and Trotski, following up the points made by Lenin \nin his article, wrote to Stalin asking him to incorporate several \namendments in the theses prepared by Stalin for the forthcoming Party \nCongress. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. 135 Nothing could better illustrate \nTrotski's lack of political nous: the premium on being perceived as \n Deaths and Entrances \n313 \nLenin's faithful follower had never been higher. On \n16 April, Lidiya Fotieva returned to her duties after an absence over \nnearly three weeks and informed Stalin, Kamenev and Trotski that \nLenin had told her, shortly before his last attack, that he intended soon \nto publish the article on Georgia and the national question which he \nhad dictated on 31 December 1922}36 Both Kamenev and Trotski had \ndiscussed its contents. The danger for Stalin was that Lenin had not \nonly called for a re-orientation of policy on Georgia but also picked \nout Stalin for specific censure. 137 \nTrotski and, at first, Kamenev favoured publication in accordance \nwith Lenin's newly-reported wishes. 139 Trotski retorted that \nhe had had no knowledge that Lenin had wanted immediate \npublication, and Stalin backed down in conversation with him. 141 Further consultations \nled to a decision on 18 April to divulge Lenin's article not to the party \nat large nor even to the Twelfth Congress as a whole but instead only to \nthe heads of provincial delegations to the Congress. \nStalin also knew that, in Bolshevik debates on the national question in \nthe past, he himself had been closer to the core of his party's opinion \nthan had Lenin; and he continued to benefit from the fact that Lenin's \nrecommendation for the sacking of Stalin from the General Secretary-\nship was unknown to the rest of the Politburo. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. 146 \nIn reality he knew that not even Lenin had urged the dissolution of the \nTrancaucasian Federation. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. \nStalin's bid to seem the loyal and trusted adjutant of Lenin continued \nas he presented Lenin's proposals for internal party re-organisation to \nthe Congress. 1411 \n'Lenin' and 'Leninism' had, for the first time, become entirely the \nplaythings of Bolsheviks other than Lenin. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. Stalin took the \nlead in distorting Lenin's intentions as indicated in his last notes and \narticles. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. His \n Deaths and Entrances \n315 \nposition in the Secretariat, whence Lenin had secretly planned to sack \nhim, was secure. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. It was a \nterm ostensibly resisted by Lenin in his active life since he claimed only \nto conserve, replicate and develop the ideas of Marx and Engels. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'.' 54 Kamenev founded a Lenin \nInstitute in Moscow to co-ordinate the research on Lenin and the \npublication of his works. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. 155 The veneration of Lenin burst \nprevious limits: he was seer without equal; he was doughty national \nhero; he was unblemished saint; he was the light of the world. \nThe purpose of the reverential excess was plain: Lenin was to be used \nas a means of gathering support for the central party leaders within the \nparty and for the party in society as a whole. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. 156 Those present would seem to have \nincluded Stalin, Trotski, Kamenev, Bukharin, Kalinin and Rykov. Stalin put this in such a way as to \nimply that he was only relaying a proposal coming from provincial \nparty leaders. They abhorred the wish to treat Lenin's corpse, whensoever \nit became available as such, as if it were the reliquium of an Orthodox \nChurch saint; their Marxist world-view was offended. But Stalin's insistence on \naddressing it showed that he was thinking in greater detail than was \nany rival about the scenario after Lenin's death. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. At the Central \nCommittee plenum in October 1923, he stood up to defend himself and \ndenied any intention of breaking with the Politburo and planning a \nBonapartist coup. Dogged by ill-\nhealth and laden with the image of a disturber of the Leninist party \nleadership, he was tactically outplayed. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "Thick_As_Thieves_1923": "", "Instead_Lenin_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. A question \nof the same order arises in connection with Lenin: would the history of \nthe USSR have been greatly different if premature illness had not \nended his life. \nIt is necessary to pause before proceeding to the dramatic last \nmonths of Lenin's career in order to take stock of the issues. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. Generations of Stalin's enemies took this as \nproof positive that he indeed betrayed true Leninism. But Lenin's \njudgement is not reliable. Nothing said \nor done by the dying Lenin suggested that he had changed his mind on \nsuch fundamental essentials of post-October Leninism. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. We cannot be sure; but it is also improbable that the War \nCommunist methods used in the late I 920s to pulverise the peasantry \ninto submission and undertake the collectivisation of agriculture by \nmain force would have occurred to Lenin as a desirable project. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Nobody proclaimed Lenin's \nconstancy more loudly than that other great claimant to his mantle: \nLev Trotski. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought. In this he had to \nignore the commonalty of Lenin's and Stalin's ideas in several basic \nrespects. He also tried to indicate that, had he lived, Lenin would have \nespoused policies identical with Trotski's.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. Even they \nstill had their differences: Lenin was reluctant to move as quickly as \nwas wanted by Trotski towards a tight system of state economic \nplanning; and Trotski almost certainly was more committed than Lenin \nto risks in foreign policy if only the cause of a German socialist \nrevolution might be advanced. But that Trotski, no less than Lenin and \nStalin, adhered to a common basic set of assumptions is undeniable. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. \nBukharin was to assert that, as they talked in the beautiful gardens \nand woods at Gorki, Lenin confided a novel idea of the possibilities of \na 'transition to socialism'.4 Lenin purportedly had come to believe that the local \npeasant community could be persuaded eventually to tum itself into a \ncollective farm and that this transformation, be it accomplished only at \na snail's pace, would be the decisive factor in the party's revolutionary \nstrategy. Bukharin was destined to fall out politically with Stalin in the \nlate 1920s when Stalin began to oppose the New Economic Policy; and \nBukharin naturally did not fail to suggest that Bukharin and Lenin had \nbeen at one in contending that a complete absence of force was both \ndesirable and possible. Thus it is proposed that Bukharinism was \nsimply the latest version of Leninism approved by Lenin in his own \nlifetime. And yet Lenin's plans for the New Economic Policy do not \nsustain the notion that he had switched to a fully evolutionary \nprognosis. Quite the contrary: his writings in 1922 include demands for \nincreased state economic intervention and for increased cultural and \nreligious repression; and at no point did he relent his suppression of \nother political parties. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. \nNot that Bukharin did not have his points of accord with Lenin in \nthis period. He supported Lenin's line on the national question; but he \nwas also opposed to Lenin in the foreign-trade dispute and had been \ncomplicit in the deception of Lenin when Mariya Volodicheva handed \nLenin's dictated notes to Stalin. While \nLenin's emphasis lay upon the introduction of literacy and account-\nkeeping, Bukharin looked forward to workers developing their own \ncultural practices and institutions to replace 'bourgeois' dominion in \nsocial thought. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. It is not inconceivable that Bolshevik policies might \nhave been diverted on to a more peaceful, evolutionary path if the \nparty had been less centralised, if ordinary party members had had a \ngreater impact and if the brutalisation of politics in Russia had not \ngone to extraordinary lengths in the years immediately after the seizure \nof power in Petrograd. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. To be sure, he had confided in his own notebooks \nin November 1922 that he expected the revolutionary advance of the \nsecond half-decade of Soviet power to be 'slower' than in the first half-\ndecade. But privately he \nput it more starkly; for Lenin, the question was: 'Who leads.'8 Lenin the class warrior was \nnot politically defunct. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922. The Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate had not satisfactorily discharged the task of supervising \nand controlling its operations, and Lenin emphasised that the \nintroduction of workers to the Central Committee would improve \n Deaths and Entrances \n295 \nthe situation. 10 Lenin's similar criticism \nindicated that Trotski and he were drawing together. Lenin declared a \nchange of mind on the State Planning Commission, pronouncing in \nfavour of expanding its areas of competence. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. According to Lenin, the Pole had displayed 'a \ntruly Russian attitude'. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. \nLenin had also asserted that only the People's Commissariat of \nExternal Affairs was reliably devoid of influential figures from the old \nregime; and yet he failed to prescribe a remedy. Possibly he was already \nagitated by yet another matter: namely what to do about the \npersecutors of the Georgian Bolshevik leadership. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation. This was that Bolsheviks, while \nkeeping the USSR in existence, should accept that the plans for \nconstitutional integration might have to be dropped.24 Lenin's passion was \ndistinct in every line, and this final political campaign was being \nmounted by a very determined 'Old Man'.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. I therefore urge comrades to think of a \nmethod for transferring Stalin from this position and to appoint \nanother person to this position who in all other respects differs from \ncomrade Stalin through the one advantage [i. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. Lenin guessed that he \nmight not have put a fully cogent case, and added: 'This circumstance \nmay appear an irrelevant triviality. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority).30 All that is \ncertain is that Lenin wanted to prevent Stalin from realising his \npotential to become the dominant Bolshevik leader; it is not even clear \nthat Stalin in Lenin's intention would be excluded from the Central \nCommittee. \nWith remarkable tenacity the sick Lenin meanwhile produced \narticles in abundance for Pravda. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). Lenin, \nunder his wife's influence, acknowledged that 'a new posing of \nquestions of pedagogy' was desirable; but apparently this would \nmainly involve a reconsideration of the treatment of religion in the \nschools; and he urged that propagandists should emphasise the \nallegation that Jesus Christ had never lived.33 \n Deaths and Entrances \n299 \nNothing in these considerations was at variance with Lenin's previous \nwritings.34 He had long \nsince abandoned his own opposition, before 1917, to the co-operative \nmovement on the grounds that it served capitalist interests. The \ndifference now, he declared, was that the state was not bourgeois but \nsocialist.36 Inverted commas embraced the adjective: Lenin sensed that \nits usage bore a resemblance to the kind of remark made by Victorian \ncapitalist philanthropists. At the moment, according to Lenin, \nthe trading methods of the peasant were 'Asiatic' and 'non-European' \nand the peasantry was 'uncultured'. Lenin's article called only for a shift \nin the emphasis of policies; it did not include a recognition that it had \nbeen wrong to make the October Revolution 'in an inadequately \ncultured country'. After all, his wife \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nGalina had put their flat at the disposal of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee on 10 October 1917 when the decision to seize power had \nbeen taken.40 Menshevism had traditionally adhered to the principle \nthat, until capitalism had reached economic and cultural maturity in a \ngiven country, it would be dangerous and futile to inaugurate 'the \ntransition to communism'; and this continued to be Sukhanov's \nobjection to Bolshevik strategy. \nLenin postulated that Sukhanov displayed 'the pedantry of all our \npetit-bourgeois democrats'. There were bound to be 'several partial novelties' in the \nestablishment of socialism under the Bolsheviks. \nLenin freely conceded that, in Marxist terminology, the level of \n'development of the productive forces' was too low for the immediate \ninception of socialism in Russia.42 But he appended a question: 'If the \ncreation of socialism demands a definite level of culture (although \nnobody can say precisely what is constituted by this definite \"level of \nculture\" since it is different in each of the West European states), why \ncan't we make our beginning by using revolutionary means for the \nconquest of the prerequisites for this definite level and only \nsubsequently, on the basis of worker-and-peasant power and the \nsoviet order, move onwards to catch up other peoples.'43 No question \nmark appeared at the end of the sentence, indicating that Lenin \nassumed that its contents were sufficiently self-evident to provoke no \ncontradiction. Before 1917 he, too, had assumed that socialism could not \nbe introduced before social and cultural prerequisites were satisfied; \nand between the February and October Revolutions he had avoided \nthe topic. What his article 'On Our Revolution' did was to give a \nretrospective legitimation to his strategy of October 1917.44 \nNapoleon Bonaparte's dictum was recalled by Lenin: 'On s'engage et \npuis . 46 \n Deaths and Entrances \n301 \nWithout directly saying so, he stressed the importance of luck and \ncontingency in giving the Bolsheviks their chance.'\" But Lenin felt fully confident intellectually only when his \nopinions were supportable by classic Marxist texts; and his usual \nmethod was to dredge up references to Marx and Engels or to his own \nearlier work. But his current emphasis on cultural backwardness, \ninternational political vulnerability and the Russian peasantry made it \ninappropriate to rehearse the citations in The State and Revolution.48 \nInstead Lenin adduced Marx's hope (as expressed in a letter of 1856) \nthat a dual revolt of workers and peasants might overthrow German \ncapitalism.49 The Bolsheviks in Lenin's view followed this tradition. To \nhis dying breath, he avoided recourse to Marx's favourable comments \non the Russian populists, who wanted to base a socialist society upon \nwhat they took to be the egalitarian practices and potential of the \npeasant village commune; he opposed agrarian socialism: his Marxism \ncontinued to hymn the virtues of workers, towns and large-scale \norganisation. Lenin remained true to himself to the end, and the \nequivocations of Marx himself in the last years of his life were \nignored. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, still \nhad him as its People's Commissar; and Lenin had complained about \nits efficiency. Lenin specified that not even the authority of the \nGeneral Secretary ought to get in the way of the Central Control \nCommission's interventions. \nLenin had originally called upon the Secretariat to be more efficient in \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nits preparation of materials for Politburo sessions. Lenin acceded \nto editorial alteration; perhaps he anyway judged it inappropriate to \ngive Stalin an early warning of his intentions about him (even though \nStalin may well have already known through his secretarial helpers. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. There \nwere also signs of changes in social policy in the West which, by \nbettering material conditions, might serve to postpone the revolu-\n Deaths and Entrances \n303 \ntionary explosion predicted by Lenin since mid-1914. The \nproblem for the Bolsheviks and the Soviet state was to hold on long \nenough, and he definitively rejected the assumption that the transition \nto socialism in the USSR would be fast. But more \nlikely the entire political camp of capitalism would be distracted from \nan anti-Bolshevik crusade by struggles by their respective colonies for \nnationalliberation.63 \nThe Bolshevik party, hoping for this favourable outcome, should \nconcentrate on the maintenance of the supposed leadership by the \nworkers over the peasantry. \nThus would the Soviet Union endure until the times became propitious \nfor the worldwide socialist revolution.64 Lenin the visionary and the \ninspirer of his party declared that 'these are the great tasks I am \ndreaming about'.' But Lenin scoffed at Stalin's words as relayed by his sister, and \nonly at her insistence did he coolly consent to return Stalin's greeting. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got. While detesting Trotski, he recognised the danger that \nthe alliance between Lenin and Trotski might constitute. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission). Unlike Lenin, he did not \ntake seriously the threat from Stalin.76 \nLenin had to act fast.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling. The problem for them was that Lenin was \nwell enough to check whether his article was printed. A single copy of the newspaper including the article should \nbe printed for Lenin's benefit on 25 January. 79 \nLenin's authority as party leader had not vanished; and, while being \nworried by questions of state administration, he was pre-occupied by \nthe political business in Georgia. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed. They deplored the suggestion by Lenin that, if preventive \nmeasures were not taken, a split in the central party leadership was a \ndistinct possibility.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. A strong hint was \ndropped that Lenin, divorced from participation in Politburo \ndiscussions, was not really au fait with current issues.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities.85 Lenin remonstrated with \nVolodicheva: 'Ifl had my freedom, I could easily do all this for myself. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. '89 \nOn the same day he asked Trotski to take up the Georgian \nBolsheviks' case on his behalf. Simultaneously Lenin was developing tactics with ever \ngreater confidence (even though his physical condition was worsening \nas a result of his mental agitation).93 All this was kept from Lenin as he \ndictated a note to Mdivani and Makharadze: 'With all my heart I am \nfollowing your cause.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. \nHe stood up as he read it, hardly able to believe his eyes: 'This isn't \nLenin who's talking, it's his illness. His note as deposited in Lenin's office referred to \nthe duty laid upon him to see that no political information reached \nLenin as he convalesced and to Krupskaya's infringements.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. But \ncringe before Lenin he would not. What saved him from \na goring by the bullish Lenin was nothing he did in his own defence but \nthe rapid decline in Lenin's health. But a \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmild, temporary improvement in May 1923 induced the doctors to \nstate that, so long as a specially-upholstered vehicle could be provided \nand driven at a slow pace, the patient should be transferred again to \nGorki. 103 Nadezhda \nKrupskaya and Mariya Ulyanova were in more or less constant \nattendance, and Krupskaya took lessons so as to be able to teach Lenin \nto speak. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. And, despite his \nenormous will-power, Lenin also wept profusely. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). Lenin's sudden collapses into \ntearfulness would now be considered a normal aspect of his medical \ncondition. The doctors treating Lenin were doing their best at \na time when the understanding of the brain was at a much lower level \n Deaths and Entrances \n309 \nthan today. Krupskaya had every right to be sceptical about the \ndoctors; and Lenin, remembering that his father had died of the same \nillness in his early fifties, had cause for his underlying pessimism. An appeal based on \nthe opportunity for work was the likeliest to get through to Lenin. This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. But she reckoned \nwithout Lenin's physical recuperation. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. None of them were Bolsheviks: Lenin had \na highly-developed contempt for those among his comrades who had \nqualified as doctors. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. Lenin's evident intention \nhad been to present his thoughts as dictated to Fotieva and \nVolodicheva in the preceding winter to the assembled delegates (even \nif someone else would have had to read them out aloud). This involved an attack on the one leader, apart from Lenin, \nwho was clearly hostile to him: Trotski. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. 135 Nothing could better illustrate \nTrotski's lack of political nous: the premium on being perceived as \n Deaths and Entrances \n313 \nLenin's faithful follower had never been higher. The danger for Stalin was that Lenin had not \nonly called for a re-orientation of policy on Georgia but also picked \nout Stalin for specific censure. 137 \nTrotski and, at first, Kamenev favoured publication in accordance \nwith Lenin's newly-reported wishes. 141 Further consultations \nled to a decision on 18 April to divulge Lenin's article not to the party \nat large nor even to the Twelfth Congress as a whole but instead only to \nthe heads of provincial delegations to the Congress. \nStalin also knew that, in Bolshevik debates on the national question in \nthe past, he himself had been closer to the core of his party's opinion \nthan had Lenin; and he continued to benefit from the fact that Lenin's \nrecommendation for the sacking of Stalin from the General Secretary-\nship was unknown to the rest of the Politburo. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. 146 \nIn reality he knew that not even Lenin had urged the dissolution of the \nTrancaucasian Federation. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. \nStalin's bid to seem the loyal and trusted adjutant of Lenin continued \nas he presented Lenin's proposals for internal party re-organisation to \nthe Congress. 1411 \n'Lenin' and 'Leninism' had, for the first time, become entirely the \nplaythings of Bolsheviks other than Lenin. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. Stalin took the \nlead in distorting Lenin's intentions as indicated in his last notes and \narticles. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. His \n Deaths and Entrances \n315 \nposition in the Secretariat, whence Lenin had secretly planned to sack \nhim, was secure. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. It was a \nterm ostensibly resisted by Lenin in his active life since he claimed only \nto conserve, replicate and develop the ideas of Marx and Engels. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. 155 The veneration of Lenin burst \nprevious limits: he was seer without equal; he was doughty national \nhero; he was unblemished saint; he was the light of the world. \nThe purpose of the reverential excess was plain: Lenin was to be used \nas a means of gathering support for the central party leaders within the \nparty and for the party in society as a whole. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. \nKalinin insisted that, if Lenin were suddenly to pass away, his funeral \nshould be a magnificent state occasion. Stalin put this in such a way as to \nimply that he was only relaying a proposal coming from provincial \nparty leaders. They abhorred the wish to treat Lenin's corpse, whensoever \nit became available as such, as if it were the reliquium of an Orthodox \nChurch saint; their Marxist world-view was offended. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. Stalin envied his popularity in the country, feared the \nresonance of his ideas among hundreds of party activists and opposed \n- at least at that time - his suggestion that the state should quickly \nintensify its intervention in industry, commerce and agriculture. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. Dogged by ill-\nhealth and laden with the image of a disturber of the Leninist party \nleadership, he was tactically outplayed. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "International_Political_1923": " There is no \ndenying that the multifaceted dispute of 1922-1923 was highly \nsignificant; but it did not affect the fundaments of the regime's \nprinciples. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923.'56 A \ntransformation in culture at every level of politics and in every social \ngroup was crucial.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided.", "Leninism_1923": " 10 Deaths and Entrances \nPROBLEMS OF LENINISM \nHypothetical questions proliferate about all great historical perso-\nnages. A question \nof the same order arises in connection with Lenin: would the history of \nthe USSR have been greatly different if premature illness had not \nended his life. \nIt is necessary to pause before proceeding to the dramatic last \nmonths of Lenin's career in order to take stock of the issues. Iosif \nStalin remained keen to present himself as a devoted and consistent \nLeninist who secured continuity after Lenin's death. Lenin had objected to several of Stalin's policies, and \ndemonstrably perceived these disagreements as constituting a basic \ndivergence over strategy. Generations of Stalin's enemies took this as \nproof positive that he indeed betrayed true Leninism. But Lenin's \njudgement is not reliable. There is no \ndenying that the multifaceted dispute of 1922-1923 was highly \nsignificant; but it did not affect the fundaments of the regime's \nprinciples. Nothing said \nor done by the dying Lenin suggested that he had changed his mind on \nsuch fundamental essentials of post-October Leninism.2 \n291 \n 292 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe fact remains that the USSR suffered unbridled mass terror in the \nI 930s. Lenin had a stature among his colleagues and a \npersonal equilibrium that rendered him unlikely to espouse such \nghastliness. We cannot be sure; but it is also improbable that the War \nCommunist methods used in the late I 920s to pulverise the peasantry \ninto submission and undertake the collectivisation of agriculture by \nmain force would have occurred to Lenin as a desirable project. But \nthese were excesses of Leninism, albeit excesses unimagined in their \nproportions and distortions by Lenin, which were practised by Stalin. \nAnd yet, just as the gap between him and Stalin over policies should \nnot be exaggerated, so we must query the supposition that the thought \nof Lenin underwent massive alteration in the last two or three years of \nhis life. Nobody proclaimed Lenin's \nconstancy more loudly than that other great claimant to his mantle: \nLev Trotski. Through the 1920s and 1930s Trotski denied that Lenin \nhad changed his mind at the end; and he added always that Stalin \nemasculated the basic orientation of Lenin's thought. In this he had to \nignore the commonalty of Lenin's and Stalin's ideas in several basic \nrespects. He also tried to indicate that, had he lived, Lenin would have \nespoused policies identical with Trotski's.3 There was in fact more in \ncommon between Trotski and Lenin. \nBolsheviks, they implied, had to be sophisticated dictators. Even they \nstill had their differences: Lenin was reluctant to move as quickly as \nwas wanted by Trotski towards a tight system of state economic \nplanning; and Trotski almost certainly was more committed than Lenin \nto risks in foreign policy if only the cause of a German socialist \nrevolution might be advanced. But that Trotski, no less than Lenin and \nStalin, adhered to a common basic set of assumptions is undeniable. The story is well-known about \nLenin's affection for the man, and Bukharin was to suggest that it was \nhis own strategical ideas as published in the mid-1920s that reflected \nLenin's deathbed cogitations and aspirations. Neither Trotski nor \nStalin, then, but Bukharinl With Trotski there is the evidence of the \nletters seeking a coalition in December 1922; with Stalin there are all \n Deaths and Entrances \n293 \nthe instances of mutual hostility between him and Lenin in the same \nmonth. With Bukharin the sources are more partial: they are reducible \nmainly to Bukharin's remembrances about what was said to him by \nLenin in the fateful winter of 1922-1923. \nBukharin was to assert that, as they talked in the beautiful gardens \nand woods at Gorki, Lenin confided a novel idea of the possibilities of \na 'transition to socialism'.4 Lenin purportedly had come to believe that the local \npeasant community could be persuaded eventually to tum itself into a \ncollective farm and that this transformation, be it accomplished only at \na snail's pace, would be the decisive factor in the party's revolutionary \nstrategy. Bukharin was destined to fall out politically with Stalin in the \nlate 1920s when Stalin began to oppose the New Economic Policy; and \nBukharin naturally did not fail to suggest that Bukharin and Lenin had \nbeen at one in contending that a complete absence of force was both \ndesirable and possible. Thus it is proposed that Bukharinism was \nsimply the latest version of Leninism approved by Lenin in his own \nlifetime. And yet Lenin's plans for the New Economic Policy do not \nsustain the notion that he had switched to a fully evolutionary \nprognosis. Quite the contrary: his writings in 1922 include demands for \nincreased state economic intervention and for increased cultural and \nreligious repression; and at no point did he relent his suppression of \nother political parties. The beatification of Lenin as the putative \ncreator of communism with a human face is moonshine: Lenin lived \nand died a Leninist. \nNot that Bukharin did not have his points of accord with Lenin in \nthis period. He supported Lenin's line on the national question; but he \nwas also opposed to Lenin in the foreign-trade dispute and had been \ncomplicit in the deception of Lenin when Mariya Volodicheva handed \nLenin's dictated notes to Stalin. Bukharin was his own man, and \ndiffered from Lenin on other basic questions of policy. While \nLenin's emphasis lay upon the introduction of literacy and account-\nkeeping, Bukharin looked forward to workers developing their own \ncultural practices and institutions to replace 'bourgeois' dominion in \nsocial thought.6 \nBolshevik leaders shared in politics more than they individually held \napart. Their disagreements lay within the definable range of Bolshevik \n 294 \nLenin: A Political Life \nideas. It is not inconceivable that Bolshevik policies might \nhave been diverted on to a more peaceful, evolutionary path if the \nparty had been less centralised, if ordinary party members had had a \ngreater impact and if the brutalisation of politics in Russia had not \ngone to extraordinary lengths in the years immediately after the seizure \nof power in Petrograd. So that, \nwhatever compromises Lenin might have made if he had lived longer, \nthe regime would have remained a dictatorship with massive state \nintervention in economic and social affairs. In addition, Lenin was an \nimpulsive creature. To be sure, he had confided in his own notebooks \nin November 1922 that he expected the revolutionary advance of the \nsecond half-decade of Soviet power to be 'slower' than in the first half-\ndecade. But privately he \nput it more starkly; for Lenin, the question was: 'Who leads.'8 Lenin the class warrior was \nnot politically defunct. \nFLIES IN THE MILK \nLenin had resumed the secretarial sessions, this time with Lidiya \nFotieva on 26 December 1922. The Workers' and Peasants' \nInspectorate had not satisfactorily discharged the task of supervising \nand controlling its operations, and Lenin emphasised that the \nintroduction of workers to the Central Committee would improve \n Deaths and Entrances \n295 \nthe situation. 10 Lenin's similar criticism \nindicated that Trotski and he were drawing together. 11 Lenin specifically defended the two \ncurrent leaders of the State Planning Commission, G. 14 Lenin's wording had a rambling quality: he \ndid not explain how Central Committee members laden with these \nextraordinary duties would simultaneously discharge the task of \nkeeping the Politburo and Orgburo leaders from each other's \nthroats. \nLenin argued that 'the infinitesimal percentage of soviet and sovietised \nworkers would drown in that sea of chauvinistic Great Russian rubbish \nlike a fly in some milk'; and he momentarily queried the immediate \ndesirability of forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: 'There \n 296 \nLenin: A Political Life \nis no doubt that it would be appropriate to delay with this measure \nuntil such time as we can swear by this apparatus as being truly our \nown. 17 The non-Russians needed \nprotection against Russian thuggery, and Lenin picked out Stalin's \n'hastiness and administrative pre-occupation' for censure. According to Lenin, the Pole had displayed 'a \ntruly Russian attitude'. 19 \nOn New Year's Eve Lenin summarised his position by saying that \ngenuine internationalism involves the largest nation behaving with \nscrupulous sensitivity towards the smaller nations within the same \nstate. His first was highly \ngeneral: Lenin emphasised a commitment to 'retaining and reinforcing \nthe union of socialist republics'. \nLenin had also asserted that only the People's Commissariat of \nExternal Affairs was reliably devoid of influential figures from the old \nregime; and yet he failed to prescribe a remedy. For Lenin briskly \nmoved on to a last recommendation. This was that Bolsheviks, while \nkeeping the USSR in existence, should accept that the plans for \nconstitutional integration might have to be dropped. He mentioned that the \nBolshevik-led republics would stay under general party discipline, \nand that any breakdown in co-ordination 'between Moscow and the \nother centres can be paralysed by party authority'. He reposed faith in the anti-\nimperial movements in China and India, stressing their crucial role in \nthe downfall of global capitalist imperialism.24 Lenin's passion was \ndistinct in every line, and this final political campaign was being \nmounted by a very determined 'Old Man'.25 It was the national question and the position of Stalin \nwhich most perturbed him. Lenin called in Lidiya Fotieva and asked her to retrieve \nfrom the safe the notes he had dictated about his leading colleagues on \n23 and 24 December. over Stalin: RS] of \nbeing more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to \ncomrades, less capricious and so on. Lenin guessed that he \nmight not have put a fully cogent case, and added: 'This circumstance \nmay appear an irrelevant triviality. '28 \n 298 \nLenin: A Political Life \nLAST ARTICLES \nPrecisely how Lenin would try to deal with Stalin was not intimated. There is no suggestion that Stalin's \npolitical career would be completely finished if Lenin were to get his \nway; it is not certain that his removal from the Central Committee was \nLenin's objective (and indeed, after the fracas with Tomski in 1921, \nLenin knew what limits existed to his own authority). \nWith remarkable tenacity the sick Lenin meanwhile produced \narticles in abundance for Pravda. It centred on a \n1920 survey of literacy in Russia. The fundamentals \nof 'bourgeois culture', Lenin declared, had yet to be established (and \nhere he was implicitly criticising not Stalin but Bukharin). Lenin, \nunder his wife's influence, acknowledged that 'a new posing of \nquestions of pedagogy' was desirable; but apparently this would \nmainly involve a reconsideration of the treatment of religion in the \nschools; and he urged that propagandists should emphasise the \nallegation that Jesus Christ had never lived.33 \n Deaths and Entrances \n299 \nNothing in these considerations was at variance with Lenin's previous \nwritings.34 He had long \nsince abandoned his own opposition, before 1917, to the co-operative \nmovement on the grounds that it served capitalist interests. The \ndifference now, he declared, was that the state was not bourgeois but \nsocialist.36 Inverted commas embraced the adjective: Lenin sensed that \nits usage bore a resemblance to the kind of remark made by Victorian \ncapitalist philanthropists. At the moment, according to Lenin, \nthe trading methods of the peasant were 'Asiatic' and 'non-European' \nand the peasantry was 'uncultured'. Lenin's article called only for a shift \nin the emphasis of policies; it did not include a recognition that it had \nbeen wrong to make the October Revolution 'in an inadequately \ncultured country'.39 This idea was resumed in his review of Nikolai \nSukhanov's multi-volume history of the two Revolutions of 1917. After all, his wife \n 300 \nLenin: A Political Life \nGalina had put their flat at the disposal of the Bolshevik Central \nCommittee on 10 October 1917 when the decision to seize power had \nbeen taken.40 Menshevism had traditionally adhered to the principle \nthat, until capitalism had reached economic and cultural maturity in a \ngiven country, it would be dangerous and futile to inaugurate 'the \ntransition to communism'; and this continued to be Sukhanov's \nobjection to Bolshevik strategy. \nLenin postulated that Sukhanov displayed 'the pedantry of all our \npetit-bourgeois democrats'. His major point was that Marxism \ndemanded eternal 'flexibility' .41 This meant that the peculiarities of \nRussia, situated between East and West and between advanced \nindustrialism and the pre-industrial condition, had to be taken into \naccount. There were bound to be 'several partial novelties' in the \nestablishment of socialism under the Bolsheviks. \nLenin freely conceded that, in Marxist terminology, the level of \n'development of the productive forces' was too low for the immediate \ninception of socialism in Russia.42 But he appended a question: 'If the \ncreation of socialism demands a definite level of culture (although \nnobody can say precisely what is constituted by this definite \"level of \nculture\" since it is different in each of the West European states), why \ncan't we make our beginning by using revolutionary means for the \nconquest of the prerequisites for this definite level and only \nsubsequently, on the basis of worker-and-peasant power and the \nsoviet order, move onwards to catch up other peoples.'43 No question \nmark appeared at the end of the sentence, indicating that Lenin \nassumed that its contents were sufficiently self-evident to provoke no \ncontradiction. Before 1917 he, too, had assumed that socialism could not \nbe introduced before social and cultural prerequisites were satisfied; \nand between the February and October Revolutions he had avoided \nthe topic. What his article 'On Our Revolution' did was to give a \nretrospective legitimation to his strategy of October 1917.44 \nNapoleon Bonaparte's dictum was recalled by Lenin: 'On s'engage et \npuis .'\" But Lenin felt fully confident intellectually only when his \nopinions were supportable by classic Marxist texts; and his usual \nmethod was to dredge up references to Marx and Engels or to his own \nearlier work. But his current emphasis on cultural backwardness, \ninternational political vulnerability and the Russian peasantry made it \ninappropriate to rehearse the citations in The State and Revolution.48 \nInstead Lenin adduced Marx's hope (as expressed in a letter of 1856) \nthat a dual revolt of workers and peasants might overthrow German \ncapitalism.49 The Bolsheviks in Lenin's view followed this tradition. To \nhis dying breath, he avoided recourse to Marx's favourable comments \non the Russian populists, who wanted to base a socialist society upon \nwhat they took to be the egalitarian practices and potential of the \npeasant village commune; he opposed agrarian socialism: his Marxism \ncontinued to hymn the virtues of workers, towns and large-scale \norganisation. Lenin remained true to himself to the end, and the \nequivocations of Marx himself in the last years of his life were \nignored. 50 \n'On Co-operation' and 'On Our Revolution' were not published in \nPravda until May 1923. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, still \nhad him as its People's Commissar; and Lenin had complained about \nits efficiency. Lenin specified that not even the authority of the \nGeneral Secretary ought to get in the way of the Central Control \nCommission's interventions. \nLenin had originally called upon the Secretariat to be more efficient in \n 302 \nLenin: A Political Life \nits preparation of materials for Politburo sessions. Much as had been done to promote \nworking-class people to administrative position in the Soviet state, he \ndeclared for the first time that such workers were 'insufficently \nenlightened'. \nAnd finally - for these were the last pages ever to be dictated by \nVladimir llich Lenin- he turned to Russia's situation in world politics. There \nwere also signs of changes in social policy in the West which, by \nbettering material conditions, might serve to postpone the revolu-\n Deaths and Entrances \n303 \ntionary explosion predicted by Lenin since mid-1914. The \nproblem for the Bolsheviks and the Soviet state was to hold on long \nenough, and he definitively rejected the assumption that the transition \nto socialism in the USSR would be fast. But more \nlikely the entire political camp of capitalism would be distracted from \nan anti-Bolshevik crusade by struggles by their respective colonies for \nnationalliberation.63 \nThe Bolshevik party, hoping for this favourable outcome, should \nconcentrate on the maintenance of the supposed leadership by the \nworkers over the peasantry. \nThus would the Soviet Union endure until the times became propitious \nfor the worldwide socialist revolution.64 Lenin the visionary and the \ninspirer of his party declared that 'these are the great tasks I am \ndreaming about'. 68 He was \n 304 \nLenin: A Political Life \nannoyed at his lost powers: 'Look what a memory I've got. While detesting Trotski, he recognised the danger that \nthe alliance between Lenin and Trotski might constitute. Of all people \nit was Stalin who on 6 January 1923 proposed that Trotski should be \nappointed as Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom with special reponsibility \nfor the Supreme Council of the National Economy (and that Pyatakov, \nwhose attitude to the New Economic Policy was not unlike Trotski's, \nshould head the State Planning Commission). Unlike Lenin, he did not \ntake seriously the threat from Stalin.76 \nLenin had to act fast.71 \nLenin had meanwhile begun to move. Bukharin, unhappy \n Deaths and Entrances \n305 \nabout Lenin's jibes at 'proletarian culture' (which was dear to \nBukharin's heart) and unwilling anyway to publish so controversial a \npiece, asked the Politburo to give a ruling. The problem for them was that Lenin was \nwell enough to check whether his article was printed. A single copy of the newspaper including the article should \nbe printed for Lenin's benefit on 25 January. 79 \nLenin's authority as party leader had not vanished; and, while being \nworried by questions of state administration, he was pre-occupied by \nthe political business in Georgia. Glyasser, moreover, was \ndemonstrably hostile to Lenin's potential helpmate Trotski. But Lenin's advantage lay in his will \nto win, his prestige with Fotieva and Glyasser (who admired him as \nwell as Stalin) and the very uncertainty about his health: no one could \nyet be sure that he was doomed. They deplored the suggestion by Lenin that, if preventive \nmeasures were not taken, a split in the central party leadership was a \ndistinct possibility.83 On 27 January 1923, consequently, a circular \nletter was sent to the party's province-level committees to indicate that \nthe central leadership was not in fact divided. A strong hint was \ndropped that Lenin, divorced from participation in Politburo \ndiscussions, was not really au fait with current issues.84 The Politburo \ncontinued to insist that he should not take part in current political \n 306 \nLenin: A Political Life \nbusiness, and Lenin's three-person team were not allowed to ignore \ntheir prior responsibilities. Thus, although permission was given on I \nFebruary for them to inspect the official materials at the basis of \nDzierzynski's report, Lenin had to accept that several weeks would be \nrequired for them to assess them properly.85 Lenin remonstrated with \nVolodicheva: 'Ifl had my freedom, I could easily do all this for myself. Exactly when it was that Lenin \nfound out is not known. '89 \nOn the same day he asked Trotski to take up the Georgian \nBolsheviks' case on his behalf. Simultaneously Lenin was developing tactics with ever \ngreater confidence (even though his physical condition was worsening \nas a result of his mental agitation).93 All this was kept from Lenin as he \ndictated a note to Mdivani and Makharadze: 'With all my heart I am \nfollowing your cause.'94 Lenin's condition worsened in the night of 6-7 \nMarch. His note as deposited in Lenin's office referred to \nthe duty laid upon him to see that no political information reached \nLenin as he convalesced and to Krupskaya's infringements.98 A struggle between Lenin and Stalin on the personal \nand political front was virtually inevitable. But \ncringe before Lenin he would not. What saved him from \na goring by the bullish Lenin was nothing he did in his own defence but \nthe rapid decline in Lenin's health. But a \n 308 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmild, temporary improvement in May 1923 induced the doctors to \nstate that, so long as a specially-upholstered vehicle could be provided \nand driven at a slow pace, the patient should be transferred again to \nGorki. 103 Nadezhda \nKrupskaya and Mariya Ulyanova were in more or less constant \nattendance, and Krupskaya took lessons so as to be able to teach Lenin \nto speak. 106 Lenin sometimes fell into despair. And, despite his \nenormous will-power, Lenin also wept profusely. 110 \nLenin was embarrassed at appearing weak and helpless (and this \nembarrassment was subsequently felt by the builders of his cult- it was \nnot until the late 1980s that the intimate details of the progress of his \nillness were pulled out of the archives). Lenin's sudden collapses into \ntearfulness would now be considered a normal aspect of his medical \ncondition. The doctors treating Lenin were doing their best at \na time when the understanding of the brain was at a much lower level \n Deaths and Entrances \n309 \nthan today. Krupskaya had every right to be sceptical about the \ndoctors; and Lenin, remembering that his father had died of the same \nillness in his early fifties, had cause for his underlying pessimism. An appeal based on \nthe opportunity for work was the likeliest to get through to Lenin. This touched him particularly when \n 310 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhe asked about associates from earlier periods in his career. But she reckoned \nwithout Lenin's physical recuperation. 120 A few of his fellow Bolshevik leaders came out \nto see him. Dissuasion did not work on Lenin. Lenin \nwas beside himself with delight. Lenin went up to his old \noffice and to the meeting room of Sovnarkom. 123 \nIn the remaining months of 1923 Lenin went out riding in the car in \nthe vicinity. Lenin's \nbursts of irritation also returned. None of them were Bolsheviks: Lenin had \na highly-developed contempt for those among his comrades who had \nqualified as doctors. Not even Lenin's \nhostility to them dispirited them. \nTHE POLITICS OF MORTALITY \nLenin's incapacitation over these several months worked to Stalin's \nfavour. If the stroke of March 1923 had killed him immediately, then a \nquestion would have simultaneously arisen about what should be done \nwith his 'Letter to the Congress' and his recommendation that Stalin \nshould be dismissed from the General Secretaryship. Lenin's evident intention \nhad been to present his thoughts as dictated to Fotieva and \nVolodicheva in the preceding winter to the assembled delegates (even \nif someone else would have had to read them out aloud). This involved an attack on the one leader, apart from Lenin, \nwho was clearly hostile to him: Trotski. A tripartite \n 312 \nLenin: A Political Life \ncoalition of Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev was vital to Stalin's \nretention in the core of the central party leadership; and he had to be \nwilling even to let Zinoviev enjoy greater prominence than he would \notherwise have obtained. Trotski, having received Lenin's \nmaterials on the national question (including the draft article where \nStalin, Dzierzynski and Ordzhonikidze were specifically criticised), 128 \nrefrained from an unconditional assault on Stalin. Trotski showed solidarity with Lenin's policies but, according \nto his later account, did not seek punishment for Stalin, Dzierzynski \nand Ordzhonikidze. Stalin even incorporated the point that \nthe danger posed to the party by the nationalism of non-Russian \nBolsheviks was a reaction to Great Russian chauvinist behaviour; and \nthe amended version was supplied to Pravda on 24 March. 135 Nothing could better illustrate \nTrotski's lack of political nous: the premium on being perceived as \n Deaths and Entrances \n313 \nLenin's faithful follower had never been higher. \nThen something happened which destroyed Stalin's equanimity. 137 \nTrotski and, at first, Kamenev favoured publication in accordance \nwith Lenin's newly-reported wishes. 141 Further consultations \nled to a decision on 18 April to divulge Lenin's article not to the party \nat large nor even to the Twelfth Congress as a whole but instead only to \nthe heads of provincial delegations to the Congress. 144 No one could charge Stalin with gratuitous hostility to \nTrotski. \nZinoviev, who was certainly keen to remove the mantle from Lenin's \nback, gave the political report instead; 145 and Trotski did nothing to \nindicate that the Politburo was riven by rivalries. On the \ncontrary, he laid emphasis on his contention that the Georgian \nBolshevik opposition to the formation of the Transcaucasian \n 314 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFederation in 1922 showed that nationalism had taken the offensive. 146 \nIn reality he knew that not even Lenin had urged the dissolution of the \nTrancaucasian Federation. Thus, in the eyes of most delegates, Lenin \nwas made to appear closer to Stalin's position than was the case. 1411 \n'Lenin' and 'Leninism' had, for the first time, become entirely the \nplaythings of Bolsheviks other than Lenin. \nPravda printed a supplement: 'Comrade Lenin on Holiday'. Stalin took the \nlead in distorting Lenin's intentions as indicated in his last notes and \narticles. He now removed the detonator placed by Lenin in \nhis proposals for the re-organisation of the central party apparatus. His \n Deaths and Entrances \n315 \nposition in the Secretariat, whence Lenin had secretly planned to sack \nhim, was secure. 151 \nThe official campaign to exalt 'Leninism' was intensified. It was a \nterm ostensibly resisted by Lenin in his active life since he claimed only \nto conserve, replicate and develop the ideas of Marx and Engels. 152 But \nit was Lenin's 'teaching' that was stated by Kamenev to be the \n'touchstone' of the Politburo's discussions in Lenin's absence. 1s3 Even \nmore effusively, Zinoviev declared that the party yearned for guidance \nfrom Lenin like 'a thirsty man who on a hot summer's day comes upon \na deep, clear spring to drink his fill'.' 54 Kamenev founded a Lenin \nInstitute in Moscow to co-ordinate the research on Lenin and the \npublication of his works. An appeal was issued by Kamenev and Stalin \nfor items of Leniniana to be released by their holders. A museum was \nestablished in Lenin's honour. 155 The veneration of Lenin burst \nprevious limits: he was seer without equal; he was doughty national \nhero; he was unblemished saint; he was the light of the world. \nThe purpose of the reverential excess was plain: Lenin was to be used \nas a means of gathering support for the central party leaders within the \nparty and for the party in society as a whole. Stalin was already \nelaborating extravagant projects. According to stories circulating in \nMoscow in the mid-1 920s, he called together Politburo colleagues in \nautumn and argued that a plan ought to be made for the contingency \nthat Lenin might soon die. They abhorred the wish to treat Lenin's corpse, whensoever \nit became available as such, as if it were the reliquium of an Orthodox \nChurch saint; their Marxist world-view was offended. 158 The lessening of the \n 316 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthreat from Lenin, however, brought the danger of Trotski and his \nsupporters more prominently in view. Stalin envied his popularity in the country, feared the \nresonance of his ideas among hundreds of party activists and opposed \n- at least at that time - his suggestion that the state should quickly \nintensify its intervention in industry, commerce and agriculture. \nTrotski gave him his opportunity in October 1923. His anti-Bolshevik past was held against him. Dogged by ill-\nhealth and laden with the image of a disturber of the Leninist party \nleadership, he was tactically outplayed. The scene was \nset for a show-down dreaded by Lenin since 1922. The speed of Trotski's humiliation astounded even \nStalin's adherents. Only if Lenin were to recuperate and quickly return \nto public office would Stalin's advance on power be reversed.", "Middle_Peasants_1918": "46 Kautsky had become stupid; he could not \nunderstand that the equalisation of peasant landholdings was not \neconomically regressive since, in the long term, it would allow the \npeasants to aggregate themselves into ever larger units of production. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. 139 But the interests of most peasants, he asserted with \nequal firmness, would be protected. At the Fifth Congress of Soviets on \n5 July he declared: 'It is untrue, and a thousand times untrue, that this \nis a struggle with the peasantry; and we don't have a disagreement with \nthe middle peasants who have only infinitesimal surpluses. The \ntypical effect of the peasant movement had been a redistribution of \nland, and the overwhelming majority of households had joined what \nLenin would call the middling category. If it was true that the country \nhad barely enough surplus grain to survive, then it stood to reason that \n'middle peasants' would have to hand over substantial grain stocks. 143 \nThe richer peasants known as kulaks, a diminished proportion of the \npeasantry, could not supply the entire state's needs. Even \nLenin, supposedly the party's expert on the social and economic \nconditions of the peasantry, could define a middle peasant in highly \ngeneral terms: 'Someone who does not sell his labour power is what we \nrefer to as \"middling\". \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 149 He \nalso acted to allow middle peasants to be included in the committees of \nthe village poor. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. Even so, decrees on \nthe establishment of collective farms were issued in February 1919 \ndespite the antagonism of most peasants. 158 Urban detachments were \nill-informed as to the definition of a middle peasant (as Lenin was told \nto his face when he addressed the Petro grad Soviet on 13 March). 1 59 \nLenin referred still to peasant revolts against the abuses of the food-\nsupply commissars as kulak uprisings. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend.", "Bolshevik_Practicality_1918": " The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. Lenin, Trotski, Zinoviev, Kamenev, \nSverdlov: the entire leading cadre of the party took it as their duty to \ngo frequently among the workers and impress them with their \ncommitment to ideals which would soon become the predominant \npolitical reality. In fact the Bolshevik central leadership lived in \nconditions which, if they were modest by the standards of the tsars, \nwere yet far removed from the still increasing poverty of Russian \nfactory workers. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places. He was expected to \n29 \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspeak there in the afternoon and again at the Mikhelson Armaments \nFactory at around 6. At the Corn Exchange he \nwas on good form, telling his audience: 'Let every worker and peasant \nwho has vacillated on the question of power take a look at the Volga, \nat Siberia, at Ukraine, and then the answer will come back by itself, \nclear and definite.'3 Russian workers ought by then to \nknow better than the working classes abroad.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm. Lenin barked out the words, fist raised in the air and eyes \nsparkling in front of the jostling listeners.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas. The Cheka had had its \nmen present at both the Corn Exchange and the Mikhelson Factory, \nand Bolshevik party officials likeN. Ivanov had also been there to \ngreet Lenin when he arrived to speak.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. On the same day as Lenin had been attacked in \nMoscow, a similar (and successful) attempt had been made on the life \nof the Cheka's chief in Petrograd, Moisei Uritski. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nSverdlov and his colleagues were ruthlessly seizing a chance to lay \ncollective guilt at the door of a party which had been overwhelmingly \nmore popular that the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly.21 A liaison with Socialist \nRevolutionaries might have been acceptable to her.22 \nSverdlov wanted to perpetuate the memory of the assault on Lenin \nwhile preventing a cult of the martyr who had allegedly attacked him.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. \n'PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND KAUTSKY THE \nRENEGADE' \nLenin was too frail to write in longhand; but, being determined to use \nhis unsought leisure to the full, he took on a short-hand secretary26 and \nbegan yet another booklet on Marxist theory: Proletarian Revolution \nand Kautsky the Renegade. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader. Kautsky for the first time had dedicated an entire work \nto Lenin and the questions raised by him. The fact that few \ncopies of Kautsky's work were being bought in Berlin did not reassure \nLenin.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here.33 Lenin was chancing his arm intellectually. 34 This was \nsheer speculation; and, if a calmer consideration of the texts of Marx \nand Engels had been imposed on Lenin, he would have lost the debate \nthrough his over-statements and distortions.'35 \nThe strongest sections of the booklet lie with Lenin's demonstration \nthat Kautsky had expunged the arguments for violent revolution and \ndictatorship from his presentation of Marxism. Weakness was most \nremarkable in Lenin's replies to Kautsky's comments on Lenin himself. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable.37 Lenin was being hypocritical, too, inasmuch as his security \ntroops had recently fired on crowds of workers and his diplomats had \nmade unpublicised deals with the German emperor. \nLenin pretended that things were happier in Soviet Russia than \nKautsky rightly contended. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. They knew the reality of \n'Soviet power'. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. Kautsky had posed a substantive \nquestion: why did prudence require the disenfranchisement of a \nRussian bourgeoisie which by Lenin's own acknowledgement was \nweak. Lenin replied only with another question, asking whether \nKautsky had forgotten that Marx and Engels had asserted that \nsocieties were run to the benefit of their ruling classes.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur. Lenin's \nresponse gave no substantive exposition, but complained that Kautsky \nhad broken with Marxism since a belief in the dawn of socialism as \nbeing nigh was a contemporary Marxist commonplace.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Offered as a review of Kautsky's booklet, Lenin's \nchapters in reality evaded the points made by both Kautsky and \nMartov in recent months. For example, Lenin did not consider the \ndemographic shifts in advanced capitalist countries or the possibility \nthat workers themselves might have different aspirations and interests. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement. His \nown booklet was an intellectually thin, self-serving piece of propaganda \nwithout the few insights that his forays into political science had \ndisplayed in 1917.51 \nTERROR \nThe attempt on Lenin's life left him poorly for some weeks. 53 \nSocial echelons higher than the bourgeoisie had gone unmentioned \nby Lenin; but, out of public sight, he had been scrutinising them. \nNikolai II and the Imperial family had been moved around the country \nsince the February Revolution of 1917.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic.55 Sverdlov told the Central Committee on 19 May 1918 that a \ndefinitive decision was needed about 'what to do with Nikolai'. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. He led a small group of Bolshevik leaders in \nMoscow who questioned whether the Cheka should be allowed to kill \nthe people it arrested without handing them over for due investigation \nand trial. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism. Zinoviev, after his reprimand by Lenin for being a \nsofty, pushed for a reinforcement of the Cheka in Petrograd.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign.80 A particular engineer or writer or civil servant might \nemerge blinking to the light of day, after languishing for months in \nprison, because of Lenin's recommendation. The problem \nwas that Kamenev was outnumbered in the inner counsels of the \nBolshevik central party leadership. \nPravda, edited by Bukharin, carried a number of critical articles in late \n1918. This resulted in a minor victory for the anti-Cheka \nBolsheviks: the Cheka had previously gloried in its licence to ignore \nother institutions. Bukharin as an individual \ncould not be acquainted with all abuses, and arbitrary, hasty decisions \nremained intrinsic to the Bolshevik party's policy. Lenin's speeches were peppered with exculpations of the \nCheka. 86 Dzierzynski had requested that \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfraudsters in the state administration and the families of persons found \nto have gone over the Whites ought also to be subject to summary \nexecution by his officials.119 \nPerhaps Lenin for once refused to support him adequately on this \noccasion. But the tension between Lenin and Dzierzynski, if it existed, \nwas negligible. Apparently Lenin felt that the Cheka's affairs were best \nhandled between them rather more informally. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him.92 But \nnot even deaths in his own family deflected Lenin from his policy; and, \nconsciously or not, he even relished the violence. His instructions to the \nPenza Bolshevik leaders on II August 1918 are testimony to this: \n'Hang no fewer than a hundred well-known kulaks, rich-bags and \nblood-suckers (and be sure that the hanging takes place in full view of \nthe people). The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated. In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime. \nHe would have had a harder time keeping his party to toe the line of \nBrest-Litovsk if the Civil War had not monopolised its energies in the \nlatter months of 1918.97 \nThese world-changing events made no appearance on the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee agenda-sheet through to the end of the year.98 \nThere was no decline of interest in Germany; but Lenin and his \ncolleagues could not be certain, at least until the first week of \nNovember, that the German military machine was irreparably harmed \nand incapable of turning its power against Moscow.99 Lenin was unconvinced that Joffe had a proper \nmastery over the necessary detail. Lenin saw the \nSpartakusbund, which was a splinter group of the old German Social-\nDemocratic Party led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnecht, as the \nlikeliest ally; and Joffe was instructed to start talks with them on 20 \nSeptember. Lenin wrote impatiently to Sverdlov on I October: 'Things \nhave so \"accelerated\" in Germany that we too must not fall behind \nthem. Lenin sensed that a German October \ncould follow the Russian October of the previous year: 'The \ninternational revolution has got nearer over the past week to such an \nextent that account has to be taken of it as an event of the days \nimmediately ahead.' 103 \nAs opportunities increased in Berlin, Lenin demanded theoretical \nclarity. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing.' 105 It was comic of Lenin to think that his abstruse treatise \nwould make much impact on politics in Berlin. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. 107 Thus the Russian peasant was to give sustenance \nto both the Russian and the German worker. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. 108 Brest-Litovsk was but a temporary suspension of his \nrage to spread his variant of socialism abroad. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. In October he had signed a \nfinancial deal with the German government for the delivery of 80,000 \ntons of coal to Russia; 109 and, in return, he ensured that the Bolsheviks \nof Ukraine did not try to attack the German troops. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. Luxemburg by contrast was a fertile theorist and \npropagandist, and her strategy for revolution differed significantly \nfrom Lenin's. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Like the Left Communists in Russia, she regarded \nBrest-Litovsk as a betrayal of international socialism which would \nhamper the making of socialist revolution in Germany. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. 120 \nLuxemburg and Liebknecht would have made uncomfortable \npolitical partners for Lenin. The faultiness of information about them \nin late 1918 presumably caused him to drop his ideological guard. He had always \nfound it easier to make compromises with rival socialists abroad than \nwith those he encountered in the Russian empire. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. There is no evidence that Lenin's attitude was not genuine. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. 122 \nREDS AND WHITES \nAmong the faults of the Spartakists had been their lack of organisation \nand preparation and their underestimation of the forces ranged against \nthem; and Lenin was right to highlight them. With no greater excuse he \nfailed to anticipate the abrupt transformation in the Russian Civil War \nin the last two months of 1918. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. Thus the Soviet republic of Russia was \nreduced to a territory little greater than the mediaeval principality of \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMuscovy. The Reds retreated in disorder on 13 \nDecember 1918. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. Obviously the priority was to \nreinforce the Army in the Perm direction with all possible speed; and \nLenin, with Sverdlov as co-signatory, made just this recommendation \nwhen the city fell to Kolchak. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. Since 1914 he \nhad rejected all attempts to make distinctions between reactionaries, \nconservatives, liberals and anti-Bolshevik socialists; his political \nuniverse was Manichean. When Kazan fell to the \nCzechoslovak Legion, Lenin and his colleagues had hardly begun to \n Closing the Circle \n51 \nreform their military and political machinery for war. The \nDon Cossacks were meanwhile causing difficulties for the Bolsheviks \nand their Red forces in the southern cities of the Volga; and the French \nhad landed their naval squadron in Odessa on the Black Sea on 18 \nDecember 1918. When Lenin talked expectantly about the rise of \nGerman communism, his thoughts were a mixture of belief and and \nsheer desperation. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. Lenin wanted no repetition of \nthe searing controversy he had had with the Left Communists. \nKolchak and Denikin might know about the Prinkipo offer; the \nBolshevik party, apart from a few Central Committee members, were \nkept in the dark. They were for 'Russia One and Indivisible', and in \nany case perceived that any settlement with Lenin would last only so \nlong as he felt too weak to attack them. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed. To the north, in Arkhangelsk, the \nexpected push against the Reds never happened; internal weakness and \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe unwillingness of the British to involve themselves to a great extent \nin the Civil War induced the local leader N.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. There could be no certainty that they \nwould hold Moscow against Kolchak and Denikin, and Bolshevik \nfamilies had to be ready to flee in an emergency. A flurry of long-distance conversations between Lenin and \nTrotski led to an agreement that the crisis on the Eastern front was too \nsevere for Trotski to be able to attend the forthcoming Eighth Party \nCongress. Lenin would have been the prime quarry of the \nWhites if ever they broke their way through to the capital. Indeed Krupskaya insisted on taking greater physical risks \nthan Lenin: in 1919 she was to board a steamship from Moscow to \nconduct propaganda at the towns and cities on the river Volga. \nFEEDING RUSSIA \nThere is a recurrent supposition that Lenin resorted to force against the \npeasantry only under the most extreme pressure of Civil War. 133 Lenin took space in \nPravda to declare: 'There is enough grain for everyone. In Lenin's opinion, the objective had to be \nthe centralisation of food supplies, the unification of the proletariat \nand the formation of organs of the village poor (and this was written \njust a few days before the decree on the kombedy). By the end of 1918 \nthere were nearly 140,000 committees of the village poor in European \nRussia; and 7370 peasant cells of the Bolshevik party had been \nestablished. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 156 Leading Bolsheviks \nwere turning to an extremely small region to victual both the Red \nArmy and the urban population of 'Sovdepiya'. Sovnarkom's minutes are not detailed on the point; \nbut it may well be that Lenin anticipated a resolution of the crisis in \nfood supplies through the stocks of the Ukrainian peasantry. Guessing wildly, Lenin suggested on 19 February that the \n'surpluses for the whole of the Ukraine should be defined at a \nmaximum, for instance, of 500 million puds'. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. 158 Urban detachments were \nill-informed as to the definition of a middle peasant (as Lenin was told \nto his face when he addressed the Petro grad Soviet on 13 March). Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. He did not immediately give up his idea that, \nsince the contemporary advanced economies before the Great War had \nbeen operating on a global scale, capitalists should continue to be \ninvited to invest in and reinforce Russian industry. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. \nFor the former Left Communists, the policy was yet another reason for \nabandoning opposition to Lenin; it seemed to them that their industrial \n(as well as commercial and agricultural) recommendations were at last \nbeing implemented. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7.'69 \nLenin, while not being immune to the euphoria, pointedly refrained \nfrom endorsing the notion that the strengthened emphasis on industry \nwas identifiable with the achievement of socialism. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction.", "European_Socialist_Revolution_1918": " The October Revolution was in \ndanger. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nFictions abounded not only about Kaplan but also about the Party of \nSocialist Revolutionaries.20 It is well with the bounds of possibility that \na group of Socialist Revolutionaries, working independently of their \nCentral Committee, had engineered the assassination attempt.21 A liaison with Socialist \nRevolutionaries might have been acceptable to her. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was to be \noutlawed on the grounds of state treason.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity.28 \nKautsky had contrasted two directions in nineteenth-century \nsocialist thought: the democratic and the dictatorial. Marx had supposedly \nmeant only that the workers should retain dominant political and \neconomic influence after the socialist revolution. The other social \nclasses would not be disenfranchised, and Kautsky repeated that the \nParis Commune - which had earned Marx's approval - had not \nabolished the voting rights of the middle classes. Marx and \nEngels wrote much on the desirability of violence to transform society \nwhereas Kautsky assumed that, once the German imperial monarchy \nhad been overthrown, the working class could advance to power by \nparliamentary means. Proletarian Revolution and \nKautsky the Renegade was quickly translated and dispatched abroad. \nFor instance, Kautsky indicated that the social trends in advanced \ncapitalist societies were moving away from a neat polarisation between \n'the proletariat' and 'the bourgeoisie'.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur. \nWhat were the signs that this revolution was within sight.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe. \nKautsky naively expected to end world wars without the need for \nsocialist revolutions.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. The Brest-Litovsk treaty \nhad been signed only because the German, French, Austrian, Italian \nand British popular insurrections against capitalism had been \n'delayed'. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years.95 The problem was that no one could predict when socialist \nrevolutions in Europe would occur. In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime. He had implied that \nEuropean socialist revolution was something that he hoped for but \ncould not guarantee. 101 The problem was the \nabsence of a large communist organisation in Germany. All of us shall \ngive our lives in order to help the German workers in the cause of \nadvancing the revolution that has begun in Germany. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. A seizure of power by the left-wing socialist radicals was \nconsequently to be encouraged. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914.

The committees of \nthe village poor were deeply resented; and yet nothing was done to \nrestrain them. Not for the first time the \n'party of the workers' had more to say about the villages than the \ntowns.", "October_Revolution_Lenin_1918": " The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. Lenin, Trotski, Zinoviev, Kamenev, \nSverdlov: the entire leading cadre of the party took it as their duty to \ngo frequently among the workers and impress them with their \ncommitment to ideals which would soon become the predominant \npolitical reality. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places. He was expected to \n29 \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspeak there in the afternoon and again at the Mikhelson Armaments \nFactory at around 6.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm. Lenin barked out the words, fist raised in the air and eyes \nsparkling in front of the jostling listeners. The October Revolution was in \ndanger. that Lenin pressed his way through the crowd, waving good-\nbye, towards the car.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was to be \noutlawed on the grounds of state treason.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. \n'PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND KAUTSKY THE \nRENEGADE' \nLenin was too frail to write in longhand; but, being determined to use \nhis unsought leisure to the full, he took on a short-hand secretary26 and \nbegan yet another booklet on Marxist theory: Proletarian Revolution \nand Kautsky the Renegade. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader.27 What particularly had annoyed Lenin was the \npublication in Vienna of a 63-page work entitled The Dictatorship of \nthe Proletariat. Kautsky for the first time had dedicated an entire work \nto Lenin and the questions raised by him.28 \nKautsky had contrasted two directions in nineteenth-century \nsocialist thought: the democratic and the dictatorial.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here.32 Yet Lenin, too, was not wholly convincing; for \nit is far from clear that the co-founders of Marxism consistently \ndemanded a formal class dictatorship for the achievement of \nsocialism.33 Lenin was chancing his arm intellectually.'35 \nThe strongest sections of the booklet lie with Lenin's demonstration \nthat Kautsky had expunged the arguments for violent revolution and \ndictatorship from his presentation of Marxism. Weakness was most \nremarkable in Lenin's replies to Kautsky's comments on Lenin himself. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable. Proletarian Revolution and \nKautsky the Renegade was quickly translated and dispatched abroad. \nLenin pretended that things were happier in Soviet Russia than \nKautsky rightly contended. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. Kautsky had posed a substantive \nquestion: why did prudence require the disenfranchisement of a \nRussian bourgeoisie which by Lenin's own acknowledgement was \nweak. Lenin replied only with another question, asking whether \nKautsky had forgotten that Marx and Engels had asserted that \nsocieties were run to the benefit of their ruling classes.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur. \nWhat were the signs that this revolution was within sight.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.45 \nLenin sustained his haranguing rhetoric to the end of his booklet. \nKautsky naively expected to end world wars without the need for \nsocialist revolutions.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Offered as a review of Kautsky's booklet, Lenin's \nchapters in reality evaded the points made by both Kautsky and \nMartov in recent months. For example, Lenin did not consider the \ndemographic shifts in advanced capitalist countries or the possibility \nthat workers themselves might have different aspirations and interests. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement.51 \nTERROR \nThe attempt on Lenin's life left him poorly for some weeks.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. He chose 7 \nNovember, the day of celebration of the October Revolution (after the \n 40 \nLenin: A Political Life \nchange of calendar from the Julian to the Georgian), to address \nChekists: 'What surprises me in the wailing about the mistakes of the \nCheka is the inability to place the question in a larger perspective. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism. He had sketched, \nbriefly, the possibilities of its use in 1917; and, after the October \nRevolution, he had installed a terror apparatus.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign.80 A particular engineer or writer or civil servant might \nemerge blinking to the light of day, after languishing for months in \nprison, because of Lenin's recommendation. Lenin's speeches were peppered with exculpations of the \nCheka. 86 Dzierzynski had requested that \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfraudsters in the state administration and the families of persons found \nto have gone over the Whites ought also to be subject to summary \nexecution by his officials.87 \nUnder Lenin's protection the terror proceeded undisturbed in the \nCivil War.119 \nPerhaps Lenin for once refused to support him adequately on this \noccasion. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him.92 But \nnot even deaths in his own family deflected Lenin from his policy; and, \nconsciously or not, he even relished the violence. The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated. In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime. Lenin wrote impatiently to Sverdlov on I October: 'Things \nhave so \"accelerated\" in Germany that we too must not fall behind \nthem. Lenin sensed that a German October \ncould follow the Russian October of the previous year: 'The \ninternational revolution has got nearer over the past week to such an \nextent that account has to be taken of it as an event of the days \nimmediately ahead. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. A seizure of power by the left-wing socialist radicals was \nconsequently to be encouraged. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. Rosa Luxem-\nburg and Karl Liebknecht had been released from prison some weeks \nbefore Wilhelm Il's abdication: Lenin welcomed them as future \ncomrades in the cause of the Third International and European \nsocialist revolution. Luxemburg by contrast was a fertile theorist and \npropagandist, and her strategy for revolution differed significantly \nfrom Lenin's. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Like the Left Communists in Russia, she regarded \nBrest-Litovsk as a betrayal of international socialism which would \nhamper the making of socialist revolution in Germany. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. 120 \nLuxemburg and Liebknecht would have made uncomfortable \npolitical partners for Lenin. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. There is no evidence that Lenin's attitude was not genuine. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. Lenin's telegram did not reproach \nTrotski or the Red Army high command. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. The coup against the Socialist \nRevolutionaries in Omsk made no great difference to Lenin's way of \nthinking, and he wasted scant words on it. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. Lenin wanted no repetition of \nthe searing controversy he had had with the Left Communists. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed. To the north, in Arkhangelsk, the \nexpected push against the Reds never happened; internal weakness and \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe unwillingness of the British to involve themselves to a great extent \nin the Civil War induced the local leader N.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. A flurry of long-distance conversations between Lenin and \nTrotski led to an agreement that the crisis on the Eastern front was too \nsevere for Trotski to be able to attend the forthcoming Eighth Party \nCongress. Lenin would have been the prime quarry of the \nWhites if ever they broke their way through to the capital. \nFEEDING RUSSIA \nThere is a recurrent supposition that Lenin resorted to force against the \npeasantry only under the most extreme pressure of Civil War. \nLenin acknowledged that already there were 'revolts by people \ntormented by hunger'. In Lenin's opinion, the objective had to be \nthe centralisation of food supplies, the unification of the proletariat \nand the formation of organs of the village poor (and this was written \njust a few days before the decree on the kombedy). And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. The \ntypical effect of the peasant movement had been a redistribution of \nland, and the overwhelming majority of households had joined what \nLenin would call the middling category. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. 152 \nDeeply implicated in establishing the committees, Lenin kept quiet \nabout the fracas. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. 1 59 \nLenin referred still to peasant revolts against the abuses of the food-\nsupply commissars as kulak uprisings. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. Industrial nationalisation, which \nhad been started with the October Revolution, was intensified. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7.'69 \nLenin, while not being immune to the euphoria, pointedly refrained \nfrom endorsing the notion that the strengthened emphasis on industry \nwas identifiable with the achievement of socialism. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction. The fate of the October Revolution hung in the \nbalance.", "Intend_To_Accede_1918": " In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime. Such plans were tied \nby him explicitly to the tasks of the 'international workers' \nrevolution'. It also discarded its supplementary \nobligations as agreed with the German government on 27 August \n1918 . 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. 1919' 114 He was buoyed up by the \nintimations of further revolutionary upheaval. The piecemeal and sometimes \ncontradictory measures of early 1918, he argued, had to give way to a \nFood Supplies Dictatorship. \nSovnarkom decided on a modification of policy on I l January 1919. On 16 May 1918, \nSovnarkom under his chairmanship asked for a plan to be prepared on \n'economic concessions' to be offered to private foreign companies. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918.", "Food_Supplies_1918": " A Soviet republic that had a serious shortfall in food \nsupplies was being expected by its leading politician to feed a foreign \nworking class. For, when introducing the Food Supplies Dictatorship \n Closing the Circle \n53 \nin midsummer 1918, he was still unbothered about the counter-\nrevolutionary armies being formed in other parts of Russia: he even \nwanted to divert the People's Commissariat of Military Affairs into \nacting as the main agency of grain collection.' 135 All grain stocks in the \nSoviet republic had to be obtained by the People's Commissariat of \nFood Supplies without delay, or else there would be mass starvation. The piecemeal and sometimes \ncontradictory measures of early 1918, he argued, had to give way to a \nFood Supplies Dictatorship. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. 141 \nThe People's Commissariat of Food Supplies recorded its success. \nTotal state procurements of grain in the financial year 1917-18 were 30 \nmillion puds, in 1918-1919 110 million puds. The People's \nCommissariat was not a sophisticated food-supplies apparatus. 1411 Conferring with Food \nSupplies Commissar A. \nUkraine soon entered the calculations of the People's Commissariat \nof Food Supplies.", "Bolshevik_Repression_1918": " The Bolsheviks were therefore the first to challenge \nthis tradition in a modern society. Lenin, Trotski, Zinoviev, Kamenev, \nSverdlov: the entire leading cadre of the party took it as their duty to \ngo frequently among the workers and impress them with their \ncommitment to ideals which would soon become the predominant \npolitical reality. In fact the Bolshevik central leadership lived in \nconditions which, if they were modest by the standards of the tsars, \nwere yet far removed from the still increasing poverty of Russian \nfactory workers. \nSo it was on 30 August 1918 that Lenin had arranged to give a fifteen \nminutes' address in two separate places. He was expected to \n29 \n 30 \nLenin: A Political Life \nspeak there in the afternoon and again at the Mikhelson Armaments \nFactory at around 6.4 Lenin was now well into a rhythm. Lenin barked out the words, fist raised in the air and eyes \nsparkling in front of the jostling listeners. The workers had to appreciate the jeopardy facing the regime-\ntheir regime, as Lenin claimed it to be: 'We must hurl everything on to \nthe Czechoslovak front so as to crush and shatter this entire gang \nwhich disguises itself with slogans of freedom and equality and shoots \nworkers and peasants in their hundreds and thousands.'6 Lenin had fallen to the ground. Sverdlov took control of the \ngovernmental apparatus and waited to hear how badly hurt Lenin \nwas. The Cheka had had its \nmen present at both the Corn Exchange and the Mikhelson Factory, \nand Bolshevik party officials likeN. The only other person who may have seen the assailant was \nLenin himself; yet he was convalescing during Kaplan's interrogation \nand had no influence on its course.' 13 \nThis was eventually taken to be a suspicious statement; but it was in \nitself hardly an unusual thing to say: everyone in the yard knew by then \nwhat had happened to Lenin. \nBy then Yakov Sverdlov had been told what had happened. He took \ncharge of the situation as Lenin's trusted governmental and party \ncolleague, announcing at I 0. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich was to remember him as \n 32 \nLenin: A Political Life \nhaving boasted: 'You see, Vladimir Dmitrievich, we can get along \nwithout Lenin.' 15 Sverdlov also endeavoured to delay Lenin's return to \nwork. 16 His eagerness stemmed from a zeal to prove that the \nBolsheviks were not a one-man political party and from a wish to \nprevent Lenin from damaging his health by a premature resumption of \nofficial duties. Sverdlov's other manifestation of hastiness came with \nhis incrimination of the Socialist Revolutionaries. On the same day as Lenin had been attacked in \nMoscow, a similar (and successful) attempt had been made on the life \nof the Cheka's chief in Petrograd, Moisei Uritski. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. \nSverdlov and his colleagues were ruthlessly seizing a chance to lay \ncollective guilt at the door of a party which had been overwhelmingly \nmore popular that the Bolsheviks in the elections to the Constituent \nAssembly. The Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was to be \noutlawed on the grounds of state treason.22 \nSverdlov wanted to perpetuate the memory of the assault on Lenin \nwhile preventing a cult of the martyr who had allegedly attacked him.23 Even \nLenin was bemused by the rapidity. \n'PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND KAUTSKY THE \nRENEGADE' \nLenin was too frail to write in longhand; but, being determined to use \nhis unsought leisure to the full, he took on a short-hand secretary26 and \nbegan yet another booklet on Marxist theory: Proletarian Revolution \nand Kautsky the Renegade. Yuli Martov denounced The State and Revolution in terms as \npowerful as Kautsky's; but it was Kautsky who drew the ire of the \n 34 \nLenin: A Political Life \nBolshevik leader.27 What particularly had annoyed Lenin was the \npublication in Vienna of a 63-page work entitled The Dictatorship of \nthe Proletariat. Kautsky for the first time had dedicated an entire work \nto Lenin and the questions raised by him.29 Lenin retorted that \ndictatorship meant dictatorship and that Marx knew the meaning of \nthe word.31 Lenin had a point here.33 Lenin was chancing his arm intellectually. 34 This was \nsheer speculation; and, if a calmer consideration of the texts of Marx \nand Engels had been imposed on Lenin, he would have lost the debate \nthrough his over-statements and distortions.'35 \nThe strongest sections of the booklet lie with Lenin's demonstration \nthat Kautsky had expunged the arguments for violent revolution and \ndictatorship from his presentation of Marxism. Weakness was most \nremarkable in Lenin's replies to Kautsky's comments on Lenin himself. \nLenin's evasiveness was considerable.37 Lenin was being hypocritical, too, inasmuch as his security \ntroops had recently fired on crowds of workers and his diplomats had \nmade unpublicised deals with the German emperor. \nLenin pretended that things were happier in Soviet Russia than \nKautsky rightly contended. \nLenin was also writing for his own Bolsheviks. They knew the reality of \n'Soviet power'. They had suppressed soviets and labour organisations \nwhich had turned against Bolshevism. If any of them had doubts about \nofficial policies, Lenin's booklet was meant to dispel them.39 Lenin's retort was devious.'40 Lenin \nomitted to add that the same work had urged the investment of all \n 36 \nLenin: A Political Life \nauthority in class-based mass organisations which refused membership \nand participation to 'the bourgeoisie'. Kautsky had posed a substantive \nquestion: why did prudence require the disenfranchisement of a \nRussian bourgeoisie which by Lenin's own acknowledgement was \nweak. Lenin replied only with another question, asking whether \nKautsky had forgotten that Marx and Engels had asserted that \nsocieties were run to the benefit of their ruling classes.41 Similarly \nKautsky queried the sense of a 'transition to socialism' in Russia on the \npremise that a European socialist revolution was imminent. What if \nsuch a revolution, as the Mensheviks had asked in 1917, did not occur. Lenin's \nresponse gave no substantive exposition, but complained that Kautsky \nhad broken with Marxism since a belief in the dawn of socialism as \nbeing nigh was a contemporary Marxist commonplace.42 Lenin \ninconsequentially declared that the Bolsheviks had never offered a \nprecise schedule for revolution in Europe.43 Kautsky also denounced \nthe Bolshevik party's dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin \nreplied that throughout 1917 he had declared that soviets represented a \nhigher type of representative political institution than the Assembly. But it evaded \nKautsky's other charge that the Bolsheviks had generally given the \nimpression that they were committed to abiding by the results of the \nConstituent Assembly elections.45 \nLenin sustained his haranguing rhetoric to the end of his booklet.47 \nKautsky was disingenuous in criticising the Bolsheviks for imposing a \ndictatorship of the proletariat upon a largely agrarian country; he knew \nvery well that the Bolsheviks aimed at an alliance of the urban workers \nwith the rural poor.48 \nProletarian Revolution and Kautsky the Renegade made and makes \ndispiriting reading for anyone not already an enthusiastic Leninist. Offered as a review of Kautsky's booklet, Lenin's \nchapters in reality evaded the points made by both Kautsky and \nMartov in recent months. For example, Lenin did not consider the \ndemographic shifts in advanced capitalist countries or the possibility \nthat workers themselves might have different aspirations and interests. Trotski asserted that the Bolsheviks \nwere merely following precedents.50 But Lenin wanted to practise \nterror without theoretical justification or political advertisement.51 \nTERROR \nThe attempt on Lenin's life left him poorly for some weeks. 53 \nSocial echelons higher than the bourgeoisie had gone unmentioned \nby Lenin; but, out of public sight, he had been scrutinising them. \nNikolai II and the Imperial family had been moved around the country \nsince the February Revolution of 1917.54 \nWhat to do with the former Emperor was a recurrent question among \nleading Bolsheviks. As the regime's military encirclement and political \n 38 \nLenin: A Political Life \nisolation increased, discussions became frantic. Trotski fancied a show \ntrial in Moscow; he felt that the Bolsheviks should repeat and improve \nupon the judicial proceedings mounted against Louis XVI in Paris in \n1793.55 Sverdlov told the Central Committee on 19 May 1918 that a \ndefinitive decision was needed about 'what to do with Nikolai'. 59 Both he and Lenin worried lest the \nanti-Bolshevik forces, at least those which were not led by socialists,60 \nmight seek to restore the Romanovs to their throne. A telegram came \nfrom Safarov and Goloshchekin on 16 July, which informed the \nMoscow and Petrograd party leadership that the military situation in \nthe Urals had worsened for the Bolsheviks.62 \nLenin kept his distance from this act of terror.63 Lenin did not \neven comment on the event: through to the end of the year he worried \nlest the peasants might turn against Sovnarkom as a government of \nregicides.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. During the \ninvestigation, do not look for evidence that the accused acted in deed \nor word against Soviet power. The Bolsheviks ofNolinsk went \nso far as to offer a description and justification of gruesome methods of \ntorment in order to terrify the local residents into submission. He led a small group of Bolshevik leaders in \nMoscow who questioned whether the Cheka should be allowed to kill \nthe people it arrested without handing them over for due investigation \nand trial. Lenin had given Dzierzynski firm support in \nthe past and did not withhold it after August 1918. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. But \nLenin and Dzierzynski were held in check by Left Socialist-\nRevolutionary inhibitions about expanding the range of arbitrary \nviolence. The schism between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist \nRevolutionaries freed Lenin's hands in practice. We are \ncompromising ourselves: we threaten mass terror even in the \nresolutions of the Soviet, but when it comes to action, we put a brake \non the revolutionary and entirely correct initiative of the masses.'75 \nIt was Lenin's understanding that the mayhem wreaked upon certain \nsocial classes regardless of the attitudes of individual members of those \nclasses would give a salutary lesson that the Soviet authorities meant \nbusiness.'76 \nLenin wanted to get his retaliation in first. Lenin had belonged in his youth to \nRussian populist groups espousing terrorism. By mid-1918 his itch to \ngo further was ungoverned. Zinoviev, after his reprimand by Lenin for being a \nsofty, pushed for a reinforcement of the Cheka in Petrograd.79 \nStalin and Trotski made Lenin seem almost benign.80 A particular engineer or writer or civil servant might \nemerge blinking to the light of day, after languishing for months in \nprison, because of Lenin's recommendation. The problem \nwas that Kamenev was outnumbered in the inner counsels of the \nBolshevik central party leadership. \nPravda, edited by Bukharin, carried a number of critical articles in late \n1918. Russia was awash with the blood of the Cheka's victims. This resulted in a minor victory for the anti-Cheka \nBolsheviks: the Cheka had previously gloried in its licence to ignore \nother institutions. Bukharin as an individual \ncould not be acquainted with all abuses, and arbitrary, hasty decisions \nremained intrinsic to the Bolshevik party's policy. Lenin's speeches were peppered with exculpations of the \nCheka. 86 Dzierzynski had requested that \n 42 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfraudsters in the state administration and the families of persons found \nto have gone over the Whites ought also to be subject to summary \nexecution by his officials.87 \nUnder Lenin's protection the terror proceeded undisturbed in the \nCivil War.119 \nPerhaps Lenin for once refused to support him adequately on this \noccasion. But the tension between Lenin and Dzierzynski, if it existed, \nwas negligible. Apparently Lenin felt that the Cheka's affairs were best \nhandled between them rather more informally. Such documentation as has become available \nindicates how deeply Lenin involved himself. Lenin wanted mass killings to take \nplace while shielding the Reds from guilt. Was Lenin acting exclusively out of an intellectual \nconviction that the Revolution itself would expire unless protected by \nmass terror. Lenin enquired about his whereabouts too late to save him.92 But \nnot even deaths in his own family deflected Lenin from his policy; and, \nconsciously or not, he even relished the violence. His instructions to the \nPenza Bolshevik leaders on II August 1918 are testimony to this: \n'Hang no fewer than a hundred well-known kulaks, rich-bags and \nblood-suckers (and be sure that the hanging takes place in full view of \nthe people). The Bolsheviks were \ndistant spectators: nothing they did after the Brest-Litovsk treaty of \nMarch 1918 directly affected the outcome; Russia had withdrawn from \nthe Eastern front. \nPolitical confidence remained high among the Bolsheviks about the \ninternational situation; their conviction that European socialist \nrevolution was inevitable was undimmed. Lenin had been Jess taken aback by the postponement than \nany of his colleagues except for Iosif Stalin; for he had often warned \nsince 1914 that the epoch of European socialist revolution might \ninvolve a series of wars, both international and civil, stretching over \n 44 \nLenin: A Political Life \nmany years. Ever since the October Revolution \nLenin had impressed upon his party that a precise schedule could not \nbe formulated.97 \nThese world-changing events made no appearance on the Bolshevik \nCentral Committee agenda-sheet through to the end of the year.98 \nThere was no decline of interest in Germany; but Lenin and his \ncolleagues could not be certain, at least until the first week of \nNovember, that the German military machine was irreparably harmed \nand incapable of turning its power against Moscow.99 Lenin was unconvinced that Joffe had a proper \nmastery over the necessary detail. Lenin saw the \nSpartakusbund, which was a splinter group of the old German Social-\nDemocratic Party led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnecht, as the \nlikeliest ally; and Joffe was instructed to start talks with them on 20 \nSeptember. Lenin wrote impatiently to Sverdlov on I October: 'Things \nhave so \"accelerated\" in Germany that we too must not fall behind \nthem. Lenin sensed that a German October \ncould follow the Russian October of the previous year: 'The \ninternational revolution has got nearer over the past week to such an \nextent that account has to be taken of it as an event of the days \nimmediately ahead. Simultaneously he \ndemanded that new items by Kautsky and Martov on Marxism, on \nBolshevik ideas and on dictatorship should be forwarded to him. 104 \nLenin was as game as ever for doctrinal disputation, and upbraided \nJoffe for alleged lethargy: 'We should be playing the role of a bureau \nfor work with ideas of an international character, but we're doing \nnothing. \nLenin meant business. A 'tenfold' intensification of requisitioning was \n 46 \nLenin: A Political Life \nanticipated by him. 107 Thus the Russian peasant was to give sustenance \nto both the Russian and the German worker. At the same time Lenin \nurged that the Red Army should increase the dimensions of \nconscription 'tenfold'. 108 Brest-Litovsk was but a temporary suspension of his \nrage to spread his variant of socialism abroad. Peasant revolts against \nthe Soviet authorities were a serious problem in late 1918; but Lenin \nwas willing to take the risk of further alienating his rural population by \nrequisitioning and conscribing peasants ever more intensively. In October he had signed a \nfinancial deal with the German government for the delivery of 80,000 \ntons of coal to Russia; 109 and, in return, he ensured that the Bolsheviks \nof Ukraine did not try to attack the German troops. To Lenin it seemed that the developments in \nGermany in the November were a compressed version of what had \nhappened over several months after the February Revolution of 1917 \nin Petro grad. 112 For him, the collapse of the Kaiser's \nmilitary and political power proved that the Bolsheviks had been right \nto overthrow Aleksandr Kerenski's cabinet and inaugurate the epoch \nof European socialist revolution. 113 Towards the end of December \n1918 Lenin scribbled a note to Chicherin as People's Commissar of \nExternal Affairs suggesting that the time had come to found a new \nInternational, the Third International, which would replace the Second \nInternational which - in Lenin's repeated description - had betrayed \nsocialism when most of its member parties had voted war credits to \ntheir respective governments in 1914. \nLenin disclaimed personal or chauvinistic purposes. Rosa Luxem-\nburg and Karl Liebknecht had been released from prison some weeks \nbefore Wilhelm Il's abdication: Lenin welcomed them as future \ncomrades in the cause of the Third International and European \nsocialist revolution. Luxemburg by contrast was a fertile theorist and \npropagandist, and her strategy for revolution differed significantly \nfrom Lenin's. She had also criticised \nLenin's nationality policy on the grounds that is conceded too much to \nnationalist aspiration; and with equal fervour she ridiculed his positive \nattitude to the capacity of the peasantry to help to advance the cause of \nsocialism. 115 \nThese divergences between Lenin and Luxemburg did not cease in \n1917. Like the Left Communists in Russia, she regarded \nBrest-Litovsk as a betrayal of international socialism which would \nhamper the making of socialist revolution in Germany. Universal-suffrage \nelections, she believed, were intrinsic to the values of socialism; and \nBolshevik repression, including terror, was a disgraceful mistake. 117 \nNor did Luxemburg warm to the Decree on Land announced by Lenin \non 26 October 1917. \nWhile Lenin hoped that the Spartakists would form a German \nCommunist Party, Luxemburg wished - if a new party was to be \nformed - to call it the German Socialist Party so as to dissociate herself \nfully from the communist Lenin. Even so, she strove \n 48 \nLenin: A Political Life \nto prevent the inauguration of the Third International for fear of \nexcessive influence being exerted by the Bolsheviks. 120 \nLuxemburg and Liebknecht would have made uncomfortable \npolitical partners for Lenin. The faultiness of information about them \nin late 1918 presumably caused him to drop his ideological guard. He had always \nfound it easier to make compromises with rival socialists abroad than \nwith those he encountered in the Russian empire. \nLenin treated them as heroes in death. There is no evidence that Lenin's attitude was not genuine. Lenin \nhad been urging German far-left socialists to take power; but the sheer \namateurism of the Berlin rising, furthermore, must have convinced him \nthat an injection of Bolshevik practicality was vital to a healthy \n Closing the Circle \n49 \nrevolutionary movement in central Europe. 122 \nREDS AND WHITES \nAmong the faults of the Spartakists had been their lack of organisation \nand preparation and their underestimation of the forces ranged against \nthem; and Lenin was right to highlight them. With no greater excuse he \nfailed to anticipate the abrupt transformation in the Russian Civil War \nin the last two months of 1918. The earlier fighting had been mainly \nbetween armies subordinate to two socialist administrations: the \nSovnarkom of the Bolsheviks and the Komuch of the Socialist \nRevolutionaries. His officers abhorred socialism, \naiming to restore the social and economic order prevailing before 1917. \nLenin admitted how shaken he was in a telegram to Trotski on 13 \nDecember 1918: 'The news from near Perm is extremely alarming. \nSocialist-Revolutionary leaders in Siberia were arrested. 124 Bolsheviks and active trade unionists were executed. Thus the Soviet republic of Russia was \nreduced to a territory little greater than the mediaeval principality of \n 50 \nLenin: A Political Life \nMuscovy. The Reds retreated in disorder on 13 \nDecember 1918. It was the greatest shock to Bolshevik morale since the \nCzechoslovak Legion's revolt in May. Kolchak looked set to \noverthrow Lenin. Lenin's telegram did not reproach \nTrotski or the Red Army high command. It simply recognised that the \nBolsheviks had been caught napping. 126 \nYet these verbal exchanges were confidential: Lenin refrained from \npublic commentary on Kolchak in the winter of 1918-1919. Consequently perhaps the conundrum is \nultimately resolvable by reference to Lenin's world-view. Since 1914 he \nhad rejected all attempts to make distinctions between reactionaries, \nconservatives, liberals and anti-Bolshevik socialists; his political \nuniverse was Manichean. The coup against the Socialist \nRevolutionaries in Omsk made no great difference to Lenin's way of \nthinking, and he wasted scant words on it. When Kazan fell to the \nCzechoslovak Legion, Lenin and his colleagues had hardly begun to \n Closing the Circle \n51 \nreform their military and political machinery for war. The \nDon Cossacks were meanwhile causing difficulties for the Bolsheviks \nand their Red forces in the southern cities of the Volga; and the French \nhad landed their naval squadron in Odessa on the Black Sea on 18 \nDecember 1918. When Lenin talked expectantly about the rise of \nGerman communism, his thoughts were a mixture of belief and and \nsheer desperation. \nIt was in this awful winter for Bolshevism that, for the first and last \ntime, he contemplated territorial concessions to the Russian foes of the \nSoviet state.129 The terms approved by Lenin excluded neither the relinquish-\ning of land to the Whites nor even an acceptance of responsibility for \ndebts incurred by previous Russian governments. Open diplomacy, which had been a Bolshevik \nobjective in 1917 and to a large extent practised in the Brest-Litovsk \ndiscussions, had long been abandoned. Lenin wanted no repetition of \nthe searing controversy he had had with the Left Communists. \nKolchak and Denikin might know about the Prinkipo offer; the \nBolshevik party, apart from a few Central Committee members, were \nkept in the dark. They were for 'Russia One and Indivisible', and in \nany case perceived that any settlement with Lenin would last only so \nlong as he felt too weak to attack them. They needed no lessons on \nLenin's wiliness and ideological commitment, and his simultaneous \nconvocation of the Congress of the Communist International put the \nmatter beyond doubt for them. \nThe situation was less bleak for Lenin than it seemed. To the north, in Arkhangelsk, the \nexpected push against the Reds never happened; internal weakness and \n 52 \nLenin: A Political Life \nthe unwillingness of the British to involve themselves to a great extent \nin the Civil War induced the local leader N. \nGeneral Krasnov was repulsed from Tsaritsyn, and his previous \nreadiness to treat with the Germans forced his resignation as Don \nCossack leader on IS February 1919.t 30 \nNo Bolshevik could yet be very optimistic. There could be no certainty that they \nwould hold Moscow against Kolchak and Denikin, and Bolshevik \nfamilies had to be ready to flee in an emergency. A flurry of long-distance conversations between Lenin and \nTrotski led to an agreement that the crisis on the Eastern front was too \nsevere for Trotski to be able to attend the forthcoming Eighth Party \nCongress. Lenin would have been the prime quarry of the \nWhites if ever they broke their way through to the capital. Indeed Krupskaya insisted on taking greater physical risks \nthan Lenin: in 1919 she was to board a steamship from Moscow to \nconduct propaganda at the towns and cities on the river Volga. \nFEEDING RUSSIA \nThere is a recurrent supposition that Lenin resorted to force against the \npeasantry only under the most extreme pressure of Civil War. Ukraine had been lost to \nRussia. 133 Lenin took space in \nPravda to declare: 'There is enough grain for everyone. \nLenin acknowledged that already there were 'revolts by people \ntormented by hunger'. In Lenin's opinion, the objective had to be \nthe centralisation of food supplies, the unification of the proletariat \nand the formation of organs of the village poor (and this was written \njust a few days before the decree on the kombedy). By the end of 1918 \nthere were nearly 140,000 committees of the village poor in European \nRussia; and 7370 peasant cells of the Bolshevik party had been \nestablished. And two milliard roubles of industrial goods were \n 54 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndispatched to the countryside in exchange for the grain obtained. Lenin \nadmitted that corruption flourished within them. \nWithout acknowledging his own responsibility, Lenin excoriated the \nblunder of annoying the middle peasants on 6 August 1918. \nMost peasants anyway disliked the Soviet government's attempt to \nintroduce open social strife among the peasantry. 152 \nDeeply implicated in establishing the committees, Lenin kept quiet \nabout the fracas. 156 Leading Bolsheviks \nwere turning to an extremely small region to victual both the Red \nArmy and the urban population of 'Sovdepiya'. Sovnarkom's minutes are not detailed on the point; \nbut it may well be that Lenin anticipated a resolution of the crisis in \nfood supplies through the stocks of the Ukrainian peasantry. The rest should be left with the \n 56 \nLenin: A Political Life \npeasants for personal consumption and for the spring sowing. 1 59 \nLenin referred still to peasant revolts against the abuses of the food-\nsupply commissars as kulak uprisings. Lenin the class warrior prevailed over Lenin the peasant's \nfriend. 164 \nLenin was implicitly giving notice that he despaired of a rapprochement \nwith Russian capitalism; and now he decided, despite the country's \ninternational travail, to attract industrial collaboration and capital \ninvestment from foreigners. 167 Sovnarkom took \ndecisions on particular enterprises, and many leading Bolsheviks \nbelieved that the party was making a major advance towards socialism. \nFor the former Left Communists, the policy was yet another reason for \nabandoning opposition to Lenin; it seemed to them that their industrial \n(as well as commercial and agricultural) recommendations were at last \nbeing implemented. 168 A wave of ideological euphoria swept through \nthe Bolshevik party as it had previously in 191 7.'69 \nLenin, while not being immune to the euphoria, pointedly refrained \nfrom endorsing the notion that the strengthened emphasis on industry \nwas identifiable with the achievement of socialism. The \nanti-capitalist measures of 1917-1918, moreover, had driven owners \nand resources out of economic activity. A report on progress was already \ndiscussed at Sovnarkom on 29 July 1918. 174 The life-and-death struggle \nagainst the anti-Bolshevik armies took precedence over industrial \nreconstruction.", "Assassination_Attempt_1918": " 2 Closing the Circle \nASSASSINATION ATTEMPT \nRulers of any state usually try to regulate how much is known about \nthem by their society. 8 The gun, a Browning pistol \nnumbered 150489, was picked up from the floor; but the would-be \nassassin had not been apprehended in the act. that the attempted assassination \nwas the work of the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. There the assassin \nL. Kannegisser had Socialist-Revolutionary connections, and the \nBolshevik central leaders were nervous lest a campaign of killings was \nbeing undertaken by a party which had been associated with a \nrevolutionary strategy of assassinations. The bomb went off accidentally \nin advance of the attempt.20 It is well with the bounds of possibility that \na group of Socialist Revolutionaries, working independently of their \nCentral Committee, had engineered the assassination attempt. A thorough \ninvestigation of a single assassination attempt would not have \neradicated the continuing threat to his life. The \nperson who fired the shot had come within inches of killing him.66 The fact \nthat Moisei Uritski was assassinated in Petrograd on the same day as \nLenin was wounded in Moscow strengthened the suspicion among \nBolsheviks that a co-ordinated terrorist campaign was in process. Lenin had been doing this privately before the assassination \nattempt. His brother had been \nhanged as a terrorist. On 11 \nJune 1919 the Central Committee re-equipped the Cheka with the right \nto investigate and execute a range of offenders from armed \ninsurrectionaries to cocaine-dealers.811 Thus on 26 November 1919 he requested that \na secret instruction should be granted for the organisation of a new \nRed mass terror - as if such a terror was not in continuous operation. In his open letter to 'American workers' on 20 August \n1918, he went further: 'We take a gamble on the inevitability of \ninternational revolution but this does not mean that we are so stupid as \nto place a stake on the inevitability of revolution within a definite short \ntime.", "Agree_To_Prohibit_1918": " The period had ended by the second half of 1918.

Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov.21 But the usefulness of inner subcommittees was not \ndenied, and a further experiment was undertaken in early October 1918 \nwhen a 'Bureau of the Central Committee' began to meet. \nStalin had been appointed as food-supplies commissar in southern \nRussia in mid-1918. Despite being a political commissar, he took over operations \nin the field; and he dominated the work of civilian party and soviet \ninstitutions in the locality. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. He was pre-\neminent in the Central Committee. No delegate \n(not even Lenin.85 But his activity as People's Commissar \nfor Military Affairs since spring 1918 had given the greatest offence.9s Objections had been made by \npolitical commissars against what they regarded as an attempt to gag \nthem.96 In addition, Lenin further \nassuaged Stalin's feelings by recommending his appointment as \nPeople's Commissar for State Control (even though this was passed \nonly on a split vote). \n Only One Year \n77 \nDemocratic Centralist N. He referred to the system \nof political commissars in the Red Army as a success and maintained \n Only One Year \n79 \nthat it would not be sensible to sack the officers conscripted from the \nold armed forces.

Clauses were introduced on the need for \n'centralised party-political control' over the Red Army; for the \npromotion of 'proletarians and semi-proletarians' to command posts; \nfor political commissars to have the right to have disciplinary sanctions \nover commanders; for a reduction of the old-style military regulations; \nfor the establishment of a Political Department of the Revolutionary-\nMilitary Council of the Republic under the leadership of a member of \nthe party's Central Committee. \nThe party was to be placed at the core of military organisation; and, \nalthough Imperial army officers were no longer to be rejected as on the \nSouthern front, the rights of political commissars under the party's \nsupervision were enhanced.", "Party_Central_Committee_1918": " The 'party-\nstate' was their invention. A few secretaries held each party committee \ntogether between committee meetings which were held with increasing \ninfrequency. The party was ceasing to operate as a distinct \norganisation. At the \nSeventh Party Congress, Yakov Sverdlov as Central Committee \nsecretary had urged the imposition of 'iron discipline' and 'strict \ncentralism'. Lenin wrote as chairman of Sovnarkom, Sverdlov as \nsecretary of the Party Central Committee or frequently as chairman of \nthe Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of \nSoviets.9 No particular function, beyond rubber-stamping the \nwishes of these other bodies, was accorded to the Presidium of the \nCentral Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets; but the \ndecline in the regularity of its meetings did not prevent Sverdlov from \nsending out commands in its name. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. \nHe had said as much at the Seventh Party Congress in March 1918. His \nnotion was that party life should be revived and that the committees of \nthe party at each level of government should regularly and closely \nsupervise the several governmental agencies. Party bodies at the centre and \nin the localities failed to restore the vitality of 1917. Committees of the \nparty perforce operated with ever fewer meetings and full-time staff; \nand the local party leaderships were drastically reduced in size by the \ncall-ups into the forces. The \n Only One Year \n61 \nCentral Committee provided its own representatives to the Red Army \nand the governmental and party bodies in the provinces. Only six out of fifteen full members \nof the Central Committee stayed in the capital in the second half of \n1918.12 Military exigency prevented the central party leadership from \ngathering regularly. Central Committee members themselves did not \nmuch mind; but a different attitude grew in the provinces. They demanded that the party should recover its separate status \nand impose control over all public institutions. Their report called unambiguously for the party to \nreinforce its institutional control. \nIt is a misconception of the man that he was permanently obsessed by \nmatters organisational; indeed the worry of critics of the Central \nCommittee was that he occupied himself altogether too little with them \nin general. Kaganovich and Osinski argued in late 1918 that, if the \nparty was to run a centralised state efficiently, it needed to be efficiently \ncentralised itself. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. Indisputably the central party \nleadership had treated the rest of the party with a growing brusqueness. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst. \nBOLSHEVISM'S LEADER \nThis complacency about the Central Committee and its Secretariat was \ncoming under strain by the end of 1918. At the same time it was \nunrealistic to pull back all Central Committee members serving at the \nfront or in the provinces and put them in permanent posts in the \ncapital. Lenin and Sverdlov decided that the solution was to equip the \nCentral Committee with inner subcommittees. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov.21 But the usefulness of inner subcommittees was not \ndenied, and a further experiment was undertaken in early October 1918 \nwhen a 'Bureau of the Central Committee' began to meet.22 On 16 \nJanuary 1919 the Central Committee met and established an \nOrganisational Bureau (or Orgburo) to take charge of internal party \nbusiness.23 The Orgburo quickly \nbecame a fixture in the central party apparatus.24 \nThe Political Bureau (or Politburo) was also re-instated; its duties \nwere to oversee the entire range of political, economic and military \npolicies between Central Committee sessions. As things turned out, the \nCentral Committee met more often in the first months of 1919 than in \nprevious months; but this was not an unqualified bonus for Lenin. On 5 February 1919 the Central Committee debated the report \nby Stalin and Dzierzynski on the Perm military collapse. Central as well \nas local practices were put under scrutiny, and the Orgburo under \nSverdlov was instructed to prepare a swift report for the Central \nCommittee.'27 Subsequently, in September 1918, he was confirmed as \nchairman of the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Southern front. On 25 October the Central Committee convened under \nSverdlov's chairmanship- in the presence of Lenin- to discuss Stalin's \n Only One Year \n65 \nclaim that there had been sabotage of supplies on the Southern front \nand that front commander Sytin should be put on trial. The Central \nCommittee turned him down. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. The \nCentral Committee's leading members acted freely in their respective \nareas of responsibility; but Stalin on the Southern front had flaunted \nhis powers more than most.44 \nAnd yet he did not want the central party apparatus, despite their \nrivalry, to fall apart. Bukharin, who \nhad returned to the Central Committee in midsummer 1918, was pre-\noccupied with the editing of Pravda.49 \nSverdlov's death gave impetus for a re-organisation of the central \nparty apparatus. A system of two subcommittees inside \nthe Central Committee had already come into existence, and the \nintroduction of a set of departments in the Secretariat could no longer \n Only One Year \n67 \nbe delayed. He was pre-\neminent in the Central Committee. Even the \nfact that the German Social-Democratic Party won more seats - 163 \nout of a possible 421 51 -\nthan any other party in the Constituent \nAssembly elections of January 1919 and formed a coalition with non-\nsocialist parties had the advantage that, in time, social-democrats could \nbe exposed as having connived in capitalism's survival. 52 \nThis attempt to sow dissent in the leadership of a rival party lay \nunpublished. On reflection he decided that more harm than good might \nresult at a moment when he and his Central Committee colleagues were \nlaying the ground for a Congress heralded since 1914 in Lenin's \ndeclarations: the inaugurative meeting of the Third Internationa1.56 \nHe arranged a meeting to take place on 21 January 1919 between \nCentral Committee representatives, led by himself and Trotski, and \nforeign communists working in Moscow. s9 \nLenin opened the proceedings on 2 March 1919 by saying: 'In \naccordance with the behest of the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, I am opening the first international communist \ncongress. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The platform, accepted by the Congress on 4 March, \nsketched the proletariat's advance to the inauguration of socialism by \nbreaking with Kautskyism and overthrowing the bourgeois state \nmachine. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Instead he called for a system of two inner \nsubcommittees to be installed in the Central Committee.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. The Central Committee was \ncastigated by them for its 'extreme inertia'. Trotski, \nunlike Lenin,87 chose to engage in dispute rather than hide behind the \ncollective decisions of the Central Committee.88 Such was \nhis confidence that he asked the Central Committee for permission to \nabsent himself from the Eighth Party Congress and return to deal with \nthe emergencies at the front. A set of theses was composed by Trotski on 20 February en \nroute to Petrograd and, on their publication five days later, became the \nCentral Committee's official proposal for submission to the Eighth \n Only One Year \n75 \nParty Congress.93 On 14 March, still not having departed for the front, \nTrotski chanced his arm by getting the Central Committee to agree to \nprohibit leading Bolsheviks in the Red Army from attending the \nCongress unless a special request were to be made.94 In Trotski's \nanticipated absence the Central Committee chose G. That they meant business was proved by the decision of \na disconcerted Central Committee to put 'the military question' at the \ntop of the Congress agenda. \nTHE EIGHTH PARTY CONGRESS \nThe Eighth Party Congress assembled after supper on 18 March 1919.' as he delivered the Central \nCommittee's report. 107 The party had also had to feel its way in building a Red \nArmy. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants.' 110 \nThis indirect defence of the Central Committee was attacked by local \nleaders resenting the slights delivered to lower party bodies. \n Only One Year \n77 \nDemocratic Centralist N. 123 Only Central Committee colleague Aleksei Rykov supported \nLenin unequivocally. 127 Zinoviev roused the \nCongress by claiming that the Russian Communist Party had won the \nright to exercise ideological leadership over all far-left socialists, and \nhis report was unanimously approved. 133 This was a massive defeat for the Central Committee. He also supported Trotski, affirming that Trotski's \npolicy and the policy of the Central Committee were one and the same. Stalin had played his hand cleverly enough to be selected for it \nas a member of those 174 delegates (against 95) who had voted on \nLenin's side. Osinski in \nparticular had claimed that, while Lenin and Sverdlov had been \nacting as the Central Committee, there had been 'no political line'. 148 Fellow Democratic Centralist \nT. But his \nmain recommendation was simply that a majority of Central \nCommittee members should belong to Sovnarkom. 152 And this time Kaganovich, adherent of a neat chain of \ncommand, agreed with the Central Committee's critics. Clauses were introduced on the need for \n'centralised party-political control' over the Red Army; for the \npromotion of 'proletarians and semi-proletarians' to command posts; \nfor political commissars to have the right to have disciplinary sanctions \nover commanders; for a reduction of the old-style military regulations; \nfor the establishment of a Political Department of the Revolutionary-\nMilitary Council of the Republic under the leadership of a member of \nthe party's Central Committee. \nThe party was to be placed at the core of military organisation; and, \nalthough Imperial army officers were no longer to be rejected as on the \nSouthern front, the rights of political commissars under the party's \nsupervision were enhanced. 163 \nThe whole Congress showed that the mood of party officials, central \nand local, had to be taken into account if the existing central leadership \nwas to keep the party actively on its side. 171 Lenin announced the \nresults of the Central Committee elections.", "Bolshevik_Demands_1918": " The Bolsheviks \nwere awesome pioneers in this respect as in many others. On coming to govern in October 1917, \nthey had expected to squeeze power in the party's fist. The penetration \nof the old 'bourgeois' state by revolutionary means was a declared goal, \nand the Bolshevik party was determined to direct the process. The assumption was that \nworkers, soldiers and peasants would greet the October Revolution by \nparticipating actively in soviets and other sectional organisations. The \nBolshevik party would send its representatives to serve and lead these \norganisations. A departure of men and women from party committees \ninto jobs in the soviets had begun before the seizure of power on 25 \nOctober 1917; afterwards it turned into a mass exodus. Thus Lenin headed \nSovnarkom, and local Bolshevik leaders moved effortlessly into the \nchairmanship of their regional, provincial and urban soviets. 1 \nThis did not bother leading Bolsheviks so long as the Revolution's \ntriumphal advance continued and the party's representatives behaved \n58 \n Only One Year \n59 \nharmoniously. The period had ended by the second half of 1918. \nAlready in January and February, the Brest-Litovsk dispute had \nshaken the complacency of Lenin and his colleagues.3 But it was a straw fluttering in the wind which became \na hurricane when the Soviet regime's resources were thrust on to a war \nfooting after the Czechoslovak Legion's revolt in midsummer 1918. \nOld public bodies were retained and headed by Bolsheviks. In 1918, Lenin and his Sovnarkom colleagues \nwere dispatching plenipotentiaries to bring order to food supplies or to \ntransport. Again and \nagain Lenin said he wanted deeds, not promises. Trotski was the sole \nBolshevik leader with comparable influence in the latter months of \n1918. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. 11 If Lenin with What is to be Done. There was also a reduction in Moscow. It was all \nvery well for Lenin to be complacent. Local Bolshevik leaders were run ragged by both their \nincreasing duties and the loss of administrators to the Red Army. \nLazar Kaganovich in Nizhni Novgorod and middle-ranking Bolsheviks \nsuch as N. 1s \nThis dismissiveness of the matter at hand was no longer possible \nafter Lenin had heard from Stalin and Dzierzysnki. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst. \nLenin had been involved in particular decisions; and some of them, \nsuch as those relating to the Ukrainian Communist Party, had large \nimplications for Bolshevism throughout the old Russian empire. But husband Yakov saw no urgent need for \nreform; and Lenin apparently concluded that, ifSverdlov felt that way, \nthen things must be all right. The choice of the three members confirmed Lenin's \nwillingness to leave such administration to others: Yakov Sverdlov, \nM. \nStalin had been appointed as food-supplies commissar in southern \nRussia in mid-1918. This is what I'm pushed to do by the interests of the \ncause, and of course the absence of a piece of paper from Trotski won't \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstop me. 'I categorically insist,' he telegrammed to Sverdlov and \nLenin, 'on Stalin's recalt.'33 \nIt was Lenin's convalescence after the attempt on his life that \nbrought Sverdlov into such matters, and Trotski began sending top \ncopies of correspondence to Sverdlov rather than to Lenin.34 Lenin \nwould normally have hated such a loss of personal control, but he was \nreconciled to this temporary condition by Sverdlov's obvious loyalty. \nWelt as Sverdlov had coped, he had not handled the dispute between \nTrotski and Stalin as effectively as Lenin would have managed to do. This occurred on the railway between \nMoscow and Tsaritsyn, and Sverdlov took the precaution of attending. \nTrotski repeated his objections to Stalin's contravention of policy \ntowards the employment of Imperial officers; he also criticised the \nappointment of inexperienced Bolsheviks such as Kliment Voroshilov \nas Red Amty commanders. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. Avanesov, an associate of Stalin. Okulov fell out with \nVoroshilov in December, and this time Lenin came down on the side of \nTrotski. Stalin offered no threat to \nhis primacy among Bolsheviks. The fact that Stalin sent telegrams \nabout the Red Army not to Trotski but to Lenin and Sverdlov served to \nbolster Lenin's position; and Stalin obviously enjoyed bragging about \nhis own merits: he needed Lenin's sanction in order to advance his \nmilitary career. \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHis talent was indisputable. Lenin is said to have commented to him \nafter the October Revolution: 'And what if the White Guards kill you \nand me.'43 It suited Lenin \nadmirably that Trotski had to impose organisation and discipline in the \nRed Army. Several Bolsheviks who had been prominent \nbefore and even during 1917 failed to cope with the tasks of \ngovernment. But Lenin wished to preserve the leading group in \nplace, and everyone now knew who the main figures were: Lenin, \nTrotski, Stalin, Sverdlov, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Dzierzynski and \nBukharin. This inner core held sway by 1918-1919, and would supply \nthe major players in the struggle to succeed Lenin.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. Only Lenin's premature \ndeath could have so juddered the politics of the Kremlin. Sverdlov and \nLenin had at least tried to make the other leaders work with some \nsemblance of harmony. The Kremlin dyarchy of Lenin and Sverdlov would \nhave been ended in any event. \nLenin anticipated the re-organisation with equanimity. But there was also an \nunspoken aim: the avoidance of unseemly, destabilising disputes of the \nkind which had involved Stalin and Trotski and had consumed the \nenergies of Sverdlov as intermediary. Lenin desired the intermittent \nfractiousness to be replaced by unified action in the Civil War. Nevertheless Lenin's \npractical impact outside the Soviet republic stayed small; his \ninternational diplomacy had been confined to disclaiming sovereignty \nover western and south-western borderlands of the former Russian \nempire in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. Lenin and his party were held in quarantine by \nEurope's governments. Lenin was thinking flexibly. The basis of the \ninvitations should be a particular party's willingness to support soviet \npower and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear. But probably Lenin had judged it \nimpossible while the treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be respected on \npain of German military retaliation. The difference lent the proceedings a greater implicit \nauthority; and, by referring to his party as the initiator of the \nCongress, he emphasised the special role of the Bolsheviks.62 Lenin in turn was both exigent and conciliatory. But he \nadded, in order to attract any doubting delegates, that the need for \nsuch a dictatorship had become 'comprehensible to the broad masses of \nworkers thanks to soviet power in Russia, thanks to the Spartakists in \nGermany and analogous organisations in other countries such as, for \nexample, the Shop Stewards Committees in England'. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The revolutionary grouping in \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFrance had fewer than a dozen members. The remainder were \nalready resident in Moscow; it was laughable to pretend that such \npersons were not under the control, direct or not, of the Bolsheviks: \nseveral were Bolshevik party members. The contradictions of the \nrecords and memoirs of the next two days of consultations indicate the \nskullduggery at play; loyal Bolsheviks, then and later, wanted to \nsanitise the dirty work. The Bolsheviks by then had their tails \nup. Nothing in the theses was novel for Russia since October 1917; but \nLenin sketched ideas which, for the West, were highly unusual. Lenin had \nmade the decisive achievement in founding his own International, and \nwisely refrained from pushing the Bolshevik demands too hard. Nor did Lenin discuss the role of the party. 71 On 5 March, Zinoviev's resolution on the Berne conference \nresumed the attack on Kautskyism, retailing the Bolshevik version of \nthe inter-socialist controversies about the Great War and asserting that \nthe Second International currently gave 'service to international \nreaction'.73 \nTrotski rounded off the Bolshevik contribution with a draft \nmanifesto which summarised the deliberations at the Congress in \ntypically vivid and compelling language. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).] the \nmovement in favour of the Soviets is spreading further and further; and \nthis movement is nothing other than a movement aimed at the creation \nof a new, proletarian democracy: it is the most significant step forward \nto the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the complete victory of \ncommunism. At hand is the foundation of an international Soviet \nrepublic.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Lenin, especially after \nSverdlov's untimely death, was blamed for failing to co-ordinate the \ncivilian party apparatus; Trotski was castigated for co-ordinating the \narmed forces to the detriment of party traditions and personnel. The leading Bolshevik in \nNizhni Novgorod, Lazar Kaganovich, insisted that organisational \n Only One Year \n73 \nreforms had not been carried far enough.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. Authoritarianism, they claimed, \ndeprived the Bolsheviks of the organisational dynamism that had \nserved them well in the October Revolution. A sense had been growing in late 1918 that the so-called \nduumvirate of Lenin and Sverdlov had to be brought to an end. \nLenin's prestige, as well as sympathy for him as he convalesced, \nprotected him from direct criticism. No one felt \nthat Lenin did not work hard. Lenin was gently chided \nnot so much for lacking organising talent as for omitting to take \nmeasures to support himself with a carefully-co-ordinated team of \norganisationally-talented personnel. 84 \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe figure of Trotski by contrast evoked outright resentment. His \nearly anti-Bolshevik career had led many to demur at his recruitment to \nthe party in mid-1917.86 While no one questioned Lenin's sincerity, Trotski came \nwidely under suspicion as the cuckoo in the Bolshevik nest. Trotski admitted in 1919 \nthat 'Bonapartism' might arise in the revolutionary army; but the more \nacute danger to the Soviet state, he averred, stemmed from Bolsheviks \nin the armed forces who were incompetent or obstructive. Lenin did not disavow Trotski's policy; on the \ncontrary, he spoke several times in the winter of 1918-1919 in favour of \nthe enlistment of 'bourgeois specialists' in the Red Army. Apparently it came as a surprise to \nLenin to learn that the Reds had had to induct no fewer than thirty \nthousand Imperial officers in order to keep armed forces of any kind in \nthe field. Thereafter, according to Trotski, Lenin supported Trotski.91 \nAs late as 13 March, however, Lenin avoided antagonising Trotski's \ncritics and referred to them at a meeting in Petrograd as 'belonging to \nthe numbers of the most dedicated and convinced Bolshevik-\nCommunists'.93 On 14 March, still not having departed for the front, \nTrotski chanced his arm by getting the Central Committee to agree to \nprohibit leading Bolsheviks in the Red Army from attending the \nCongress unless a special request were to be made. But he \nhad to give way on the practical demand: his opponents were given the \nright to stay in Moscow for the Congress. Lenin would not have made the same \nmistake. \nLenin delivered a eulogy of the late Yakov Sverdlov. International relations had dominated the \n 76 \nLenin: A Political Life \nprevious Party Congress, and most party officials had been swept into \nmilitary work in subsequent months. \nLenin was curt with refusals to serve on such bodies: 'You can't \ndecline, comrade Muranov. Bolsheviks applauded thunderously. He even claimed that, until spring 1918, the regime's measures \nin many ways carried through a bourgeois revolution. These same \ncommittees had been denounced in December 1918, and Lenin even \nnow stated that the anti-kulak campaign had battered the middle \npeasants. Lenin remarked: 'Organisational activity \nhas never been a strong side of Russians in general and Bolsheviks in \nparticular, and meanwhile the main task of the proletarian revolution is \nprecisely an organisational task. \nCiting Stalin's speech to the Third Congress of Soviets in January 1918, \nhe proposed a formula offering 'the self-determination of the labouring \nclasses of each nationality'. The agreed draft programme stated that any \nproposal of secession from the Soviet republic would need to take \naccount as to what phase of 'historical development was occupied by a \ngiven nation'. But \nhis inoffensiveness was not reciprocated: Lenin breathed fire and \nbrimstone in his complementary report. Lenin wanted the programme to \nstate that the wartime dislocation had induced massive economic \nregression. 115 Lenin particularly asserted the 'right of nations to self-\ndetermination'; and, noting that Bukharin appeared to accept the \napplication of this notion to industrial societies such as Germany, \nLenin reminded the Congress that the German working class had not \nbecome politically 'differentiated' in its entirety from the German \nbourgeoisie and that any referendum of German workers would not \nnecessarily result in a vote for socialism. But Lenin was a master of \nrhetorical distraction. Lenin affirmed that the granting of an \nethnically-based autonomous administration (which he hoped to repeat \nin relation to the Kirgiz, Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmens) was the most \neffective way to secure support for socialist policies and for a \n 78 \nLenin: A Political Life \ndiminution of the influence of the mullahs. He acknowledged that 'a decree has not yet been \nissued for all countries to live by the Bolshevik revolutionary calendar', \nbut insisted that the prospect of European revolution had not \nvanished. Georgi \nPyatakov, Lenin's oldest Bolshevik opponent on the national question, \nattacked him. Finnish independence, granted by Lenin to Svinhufvud \nin December 1917, was castigated as a fiasco. Osinski, who approved of Lenin's \nformulation, accepted it only as a 'demonstrational slogan'. 123 Only Central Committee colleague Aleksei Rykov supported \nLenin unequivocally. 124 Lenin, of course, did not intend to facilitate \ndemands for separation from Russia by non-Russian nations. As Lenin put \nit, 'Come across any communist and you'll discover a Great Russian \nchauvinist. \nSokolnikov, who had merely been carrying out the instructions of Lenin \nand Trotski, wanted no further part in the matter. 135 Lenin \ndetermined to stay clear of the dispute if at all possible. Okulov, another of Trotski's staff, \ncondemned the Bolshevik leaders on the Southern front who had \nnotoriously imprisoned 'military specialists' on a river barge rather \nthan admit them into their forces. 138 Next to speak was Southern front \ncommissar Voroshilov, who described cases of sabotage by the \nImperial officers and told the Congress that, if he had hearkened to \nLenin's advice, the rapid occupation of the Ukraine by the Reds would \nnot have occurredY9 Both Voroshilov and Stalin, moreover, \ndisingenuously stressed their acceptance of military specialists in \nprinciple; and Stalin added that he disapproved of those of Smirnov's \ntheses which were likely to undermine strict military discipline. \n 80 \nLenin: A Political Life \nYet his disagreements with Lenin were evident. Ignoring Lenin's call \nfor reconciliation with the middle peasants, Stalin stressed what a \ndanger was posed by them.140 Lenin waded in. Lenin \nrevealed that the Bolsheviks on the Southern front had lost 60,000 men \nin battles against forces which were numerically inferior by far. Trotski's name had to be \ncleared, and Lenin did this without compunction. Lenin had cast in his lot with Trotski, and the \ndelegates were not inclined to rock the boat in wartime. Osinski in \nparticular had claimed that, while Lenin and Sverdlov had been \nacting as the Central Committee, there had been 'no political line'.150 Osinski, retorting \nthat Lenin himself had admitted that 'personal politics' had been \ndeveloping, focussed on the bureaucratic phenomena in party and \ngovernment and demanded a return to the elective principle. 151 Sapronov \nsupported him: he complained that too many abuses of power were \nreversible only by face-to-face pleadings with Lenin, who would then \nintervene directly. A Soviet republic had been proclaimed in Budapest. Lenin, before the start of the Congress, had wanted the party \nto declare a commitment to 'the freedom of secession for nations in \nreality'; during the Congress debates he had advocated the same \nfreedom but had refrained from using the same terminology. Lenin could claim that it indicated a \ncommitment to self-determination, Bukharin that the reference to \nunequal rights was not applicable in the areas under the party's control \n(since the Soviet Constitution guaranteed national equality). The gap between Lenin and Bukharin \n(and Stalin) had not been bridged, and the bruising disputes of 1920--\n1923 would show how wide it was. 161 But Sokolnikov had been compelled to make \n 82 \nLenin: A Political Life \nfurther concessions. This compromise was pleasing to Lenin; \nbut Trotski, on learning how proceedings had gone, was furious: the \ndispute was not yet at an end. Lenin understood this; \nTrotski did not. But even Lenin failed to follow things as closely as he \nhad needed. The question of the middle peasants, which he had \ndeclared to be the crucial question for the Congress, had barely been \ndiscussed; and such discussion as had taken place was frequently \ninimical to Lenin's demand that these peasants should be treated \ngently. Among the speakers, a certain \nPanfilov criticised Lenin's pessimism and especially recommended \ncollectivisation for the prosperous agricultural communities of \nUkraine. 168 Lenin had not been without support, 169 but had had to \nspeak robustly to bend the commission his way. Lenin brightly assured the Congress: 'We \nare convinced that this will be the last heavy half-year.' 173 \nTHE PARTY PROGRAMME \nThe development of Lenin's political ideas ought not to be assessed \nexclusively through books he wrote such as What Is To be Done.176 There was a discreet abandonment \nof the idea, as proposed by Lenin in 1917, that workers and poor \npeasants would jointly rule Russia. 178 \n 84 \nLenin: A Political Life \nRevolutionary wars could be anticipated as the struggle between \nsocialism and capitalism intensified. The \npriority, in Lenin's words, was to 'attain a further rapprochement of \nthe organs of power with the labouring masses'. 181 This was all \nconfident stuff (which the commission, on Bukharin's suggestion, had \nasked Lenin to insert in the draft). The rights of \nnational self-determination and secession, which Lenin had demanded, \nwere obfuscated in the final version: this was the single major defeat he \nsuffered in the discussions on the party programme. 185 But his efforts \nensured that the programme was not without potential appeal to the \nnon-Russian peoples, even if Marxist jargon was used: 'Proletarians \nand semi-proletarians of the various nationalities' were to be drawn \ninto collaborative activities. Lenin's original draft had been written in the heat of the \ncontroversy between Trotski and the Military Opposition, and had \navoided mention of the Red Army. 192 Lenin managed to effect a blend \nof clear intention and reassuring rhetoric which he had failed to obtain \non the national question. Lenin \naimed at 'the maximum unification of the entire economic life of the \ncountry in accordance with a single state plan'. Thus 'a struggle against the \nbureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of Soviet power' would \nbe waged. The Soviet regime begged \nfor the support of the so-called labouring masses. Lenin had produced a programme reflecting the grand designs of \na Bolshevism which, put on the rack of the Civil War, lifted its eyes to \nthe future tasks of peacetime. Eulogies of revolutionary justice, \nallowing the Bolsheviks and their supporters to feel unrestricted even \nby their own legislation, marked out a strategy for the party in the \npost-war epoch. Lenin wanted to show confidence in the durability of \nthe Soviet regime in Russia and the surrounding regions. \nBulwarks against the deployment of power in a manner undesirable \neven to the Bolshevik party are considered still more casually than in \nLenin's The State and Revolution.", "Armed_Forces_1918": " The period had ended by the second half of 1918.'27 Subsequently, in September 1918, he was confirmed as \nchairman of the Revolutionary-Military Council of the Southern front. A show of solidarity was needed in wartime.85 But his activity as People's Commissar \nfor Military Affairs since spring 1918 had given the greatest offence. He \nconscripted Imperial Army officers. Other members \nof the Military Opposition, such as V. 158 A fudge also occurred on the \nmilitary question.", "Bolshevik_Position_1918": " The Bolsheviks \nwere awesome pioneers in this respect as in many others. The penetration \nof the old 'bourgeois' state by revolutionary means was a declared goal, \nand the Bolshevik party was determined to direct the process. The assumption was that \nworkers, soldiers and peasants would greet the October Revolution by \nparticipating actively in soviets and other sectional organisations. The \nBolshevik party would send its representatives to serve and lead these \norganisations. A departure of men and women from party committees \ninto jobs in the soviets had begun before the seizure of power on 25 \nOctober 1917; afterwards it turned into a mass exodus. Thus Lenin headed \nSovnarkom, and local Bolshevik leaders moved effortlessly into the \nchairmanship of their regional, provincial and urban soviets. 1 \nThis did not bother leading Bolsheviks so long as the Revolution's \ntriumphal advance continued and the party's representatives behaved \n58 \n Only One Year \n59 \nharmoniously. The period had ended by the second half of 1918. \nAlready in January and February, the Brest-Litovsk dispute had \nshaken the complacency of Lenin and his colleagues.3 But it was a straw fluttering in the wind which became \na hurricane when the Soviet regime's resources were thrust on to a war \nfooting after the Czechoslovak Legion's revolt in midsummer 1918. The emergent Soviet state was very ramshackle. \nOld public bodies were retained and headed by Bolsheviks. In 1918, Lenin and his Sovnarkom colleagues \nwere dispatching plenipotentiaries to bring order to food supplies or to \ntransport. Lenin wrote as chairman of Sovnarkom, Sverdlov as \nsecretary of the Party Central Committee or frequently as chairman of \nthe Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of \nSoviets. Trotski was the sole \nBolshevik leader with comparable influence in the latter months of \n1918. The campaign for centralised control over \nsoviets, trade unions, factory-workshop committees from Moscow \ncontinued. 11 If Lenin with What is to be Done. There was also a reduction in Moscow. It was all \nvery well for Lenin to be complacent. Local Bolshevik leaders were run ragged by both their \nincreasing duties and the loss of administrators to the Red Army. \nLazar Kaganovich in Nizhni Novgorod and middle-ranking Bolsheviks \nsuch as N. Sapronov in Moscow were prominent \ncritics. \nLenin did not declare what changed his own mind in this direction. 1s \nThis dismissiveness of the matter at hand was no longer possible \nafter Lenin had heard from Stalin and Dzierzysnki. 16 This theme had been addressed by Sverdlov at the \nParty Congress in March 1918;17 but implementation had been \n 62 \nLenin: A Political Life \nintermittent in subsequent months. \nRegional party committees were subordinated to Moscow. The \nUkrainian Central Committee, which was formally only a regional \nbody within the Bolshevik party as a whole, was forced to accept two \nnominees from Moscow in autumn 1918 after an unsanctioned \nUkrainian uprising against the Germans.' 19 By the winter of 1918-1919 his \ncampaign for gradual centralisation was regarded as waywardness at \nbest and incompetence at worst. \nLenin had been involved in particular decisions; and some of them, \nsuch as those relating to the Ukrainian Communist Party, had large \nimplications for Bolshevism throughout the old Russian empire. But husband Yakov saw no urgent need for \nreform; and Lenin apparently concluded that, ifSverdlov felt that way, \nthen things must be all right. The Central Committee after the Sixth Party Congress in \nAugust 1917 had selected a group of eleven members to act in its name \nbetween plenums - and this had been in a period when plenums were \nnot rare;20 and, as preparations were put in hand for the October \nRevolution, a seven-man Political Bureau was created consisting of \nLenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotski, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov. The choice of the three members confirmed Lenin's \nwillingness to leave such administration to others: Yakov Sverdlov, \nM. \nStalin had been appointed as food-supplies commissar in southern \nRussia in mid-1918. This is what I'm pushed to do by the interests of the \ncause, and of course the absence of a piece of paper from Trotski won't \n 64 \nLenin: A Political Life \nstop me. 'I categorically insist,' he telegrammed to Sverdlov and \nLenin, 'on Stalin's recalt.'33 \nIt was Lenin's convalescence after the attempt on his life that \nbrought Sverdlov into such matters, and Trotski began sending top \ncopies of correspondence to Sverdlov rather than to Lenin.34 Lenin \nwould normally have hated such a loss of personal control, but he was \nreconciled to this temporary condition by Sverdlov's obvious loyalty. This occurred on the railway between \nMoscow and Tsaritsyn, and Sverdlov took the precaution of attending. \nTrotski repeated his objections to Stalin's contravention of policy \ntowards the employment of Imperial officers; he also criticised the \nappointment of inexperienced Bolsheviks such as Kliment Voroshilov \nas Red Amty commanders. The Central Committee \nmeeting of25 October 1918 ruled that, ifTrotski wanted those Imperial \nArmy officers who had been seized as hostages to be inducted into the \nRed Army, he should ensure that none had belonged to 'the counter-\nrevolutionary movement'. Avanesov, an associate of Stalin. Okulov fell out with \nVoroshilov in December, and this time Lenin came down on the side of \nTrotski.41 \nThe thing was that Lenin appreciated the advantage of not \nidentifying himself too closely with either Trotski or Stalin. But Lenin, being a committed \noverseer of terror, mostly turned a blind eye. Stalin offered no threat to \nhis primacy among Bolsheviks.42 In 1918 Trotski was by far the greater potential rival. \n 66 \nLenin: A Political Life \nHis talent was indisputable. Lenin is said to have commented to him \nafter the October Revolution: 'And what if the White Guards kill you \nand me.'43 It suited Lenin \nadmirably that Trotski had to impose organisation and discipline in the \nRed Army. Lenin, smarting from his mauling in the Brest-Litovsk \ncontroversy, contentedly watched disfavour falling on someone else. Several Bolsheviks who had been prominent \nbefore and even during 1917 failed to cope with the tasks of \ngovernment. But Lenin wished to preserve the leading group in \nplace, and everyone now knew who the main figures were: Lenin, \nTrotski, Stalin, Sverdlov, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Dzierzynski and \nBukharin. This inner core held sway by 1918-1919, and would supply \nthe major players in the struggle to succeed Lenin.45 \nThe outcome of that struggle might have been different but for the \nunexpected death of Yakov Sverdlov on 16 March 1918. Only Lenin's premature \ndeath could have so juddered the politics of the Kremlin. Sverdlov and \nLenin had at least tried to make the other leaders work with some \nsemblance of harmony. The Kremlin dyarchy of Lenin and Sverdlov would \nhave been ended in any event. \nLenin anticipated the re-organisation with equanimity. Lenin desired the intermittent \nfractiousness to be replaced by unified action in the Civil War. Nevertheless Lenin's \npractical impact outside the Soviet republic stayed small; his \ninternational diplomacy had been confined to disclaiming sovereignty \nover western and south-western borderlands of the former Russian \nempire in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. Lenin and his party were held in quarantine by \nEurope's governments. Lenin was thinking flexibly. On reflection he decided that more harm than good might \nresult at a moment when he and his Central Committee colleagues were \nlaying the ground for a Congress heralded since 1914 in Lenin's \ndeclarations: the inaugurative meeting of the Third Internationa1. Lenin had sent a memor-\nandum on 27 or 28 December 1918 to Georgi Chicherin as People's \nCommissar of External Affairs calling for urgent action, and proposing \nthat the conference should be held in Berlin. The basis of the \ninvitations should be a particular party's willingness to support soviet \npower and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 54 Precisely why it was in \nthe winter of 1918-1919 that the years-old intention of the Bolsheviks \nwas to be fulfilled is not clear. But probably Lenin had judged it \nimpossible while the treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be respected on \npain of German military retaliation. s9 \nLenin opened the proceedings on 2 March 1919 by saying: 'In \naccordance with the behest of the Central Committee of the Russian \nCommunist Party, I am opening the first international communist \ncongress. The difference lent the proceedings a greater implicit \nauthority; and, by referring to his party as the initiator of the \nCongress, he emphasised the special role of the Bolsheviks.62 Lenin in turn was both exigent and conciliatory. No delegate \n(not even Lenin. The revolutionary grouping in \n 70 \nLenin: A Political Life \nFrance had fewer than a dozen members. The remainder were \nalready resident in Moscow; it was laughable to pretend that such \npersons were not under the control, direct or not, of the Bolsheviks: \nseveral were Bolshevik party members. The contradictions of the \nrecords and memoirs of the next two days of consultations indicate the \nskullduggery at play; loyal Bolsheviks, then and later, wanted to \nsanitise the dirty work. The Bolsheviks by then had their tails \nup. Nothing in the theses was novel for Russia since October 1917; but \nLenin sketched ideas which, for the West, were highly unusual. Lenin had \nmade the decisive achievement in founding his own International, and \nwisely refrained from pushing the Bolshevik demands too hard. Nor did Lenin discuss the role of the party. 71 On 5 March, Zinoviev's resolution on the Berne conference \nresumed the attack on Kautskyism, retailing the Bolshevik version of \nthe inter-socialist controversies about the Great War and asserting that \nthe Second International currently gave 'service to international \nreaction'.73 \nTrotski rounded off the Bolshevik contribution with a draft \nmanifesto which summarised the deliberations at the Congress in \ntypically vivid and compelling language. Bolshevik hegemony was \nsecured by the proviso that, once a party had declared its allegiance to \nthe International, 'comrades of the country' already resident in \nMoscow should represent it on the Executive Committee until the \n 72 \nLenin: A Political Life \nparty's nominee could take a seat (and the Executive Committee \nreinforced the Bolshevik position by electing Zinoviev as its chair-\nman).] the \nmovement in favour of the Soviets is spreading further and further; and \nthis movement is nothing other than a movement aimed at the creation \nof a new, proletarian democracy: it is the most significant step forward \nto the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the complete victory of \ncommunism. At hand is the foundation of an international Soviet \nrepublic.'76 \nOPPOSITION: PARTY AND ARMY \nAnd yet the Bolshevik party, away from the gaze of Communist \nInternational delegates, was riven by disputation. Lenin, especially after \nSverdlov's untimely death, was blamed for failing to co-ordinate the \ncivilian party apparatus; Trotski was castigated for co-ordinating the \narmed forces to the detriment of party traditions and personnel. The leading Bolshevik in \nNizhni Novgorod, Lazar Kaganovich, insisted that organisational \n Only One Year \n73 \nreforms had not been carried far enough.81 A further \ngroup of Bolsheviks, which became known as the Democratic \nCentralists, was equally determined to eradicate the organisational \nmalaise. Authoritarianism, they claimed, \ndeprived the Bolsheviks of the organisational dynamism that had \nserved them well in the October Revolution. A sense had been growing in late 1918 that the so-called \nduumvirate of Lenin and Sverdlov had to be brought to an end. \nLenin's prestige, as well as sympathy for him as he convalesced, \nprotected him from direct criticism. No one felt \nthat Lenin did not work hard. Nor could there be any suspicion that \nSovnarkom would be more efficiently organised under someone other \nthan Lenin. Lenin was gently chided \nnot so much for lacking organising talent as for omitting to take \nmeasures to support himself with a carefully-co-ordinated team of \norganisationally-talented personnel. 84 \n 74 \nLenin: A Political Life \nThe figure of Trotski by contrast evoked outright resentment. His \nearly anti-Bolshevik career had led many to demur at his recruitment to \nthe party in mid-1917.86 While no one questioned Lenin's sincerity, Trotski came \nwidely under suspicion as the cuckoo in the Bolshevik nest.

Sergei Minin, who had befriended \nStalin in Tsaritsyn in mid-1918, was the most prominent such \nindividual. Lenin would not have made the same \nmistake. \nLenin delivered a eulogy of the late Yakov Sverdlov.
