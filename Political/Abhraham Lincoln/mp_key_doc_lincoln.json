Thomas Lincoln, the\nfather, was a well built, sinewy man, about \ufb01ve feet ten and\na half inches high, dressed in the humble garb which his\npoverty compelled and the rude art of the time and locality\nproduced. Lincoln, the mother, was evidently a woman out of\nplace among those primitive surroundings. Lincoln always\nlooked back to her with an unspeakable a\ufb00ection.

For\nmany years, Abraham Lincoln never saw a church; but he\nheard Parson Elkin preach. He\nwas a Baptist, and Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were\nmembers of that communion.

Lincoln, the mother, was evidently a woman out of\nplace among those primitive surroundings. Lincoln always\nlooked back to her with an unspeakable a\ufb00ection. Lincoln\nalways entertained a pleasant and grateful memory of him. He\nwas a Baptist, and Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were\nmembers of that communion.

The capture of Vicksburg, with its preliminary\nbattles, was the work of a great general, and one of the\nmost brilliant feats in the history of war. On the twenty-\ufb01fth of November,\nGeneral Grant, who, having \ufb01nished up his Vicksburg job,\nhad assumed command, attacked Bragg, and utterly routed\nhim, crowding him back into Georgia. General Curtis, who was in command of the\ndepartment, was removed because he and Governor\nGamble could not agree, and not because he had done any\nwrong; and General Scho\ufb01eld was put in his place.", "Captain_Lincoln_1832": "\nLincoln had completely won their hearts, and they told him\nthat he must be their captain.\nThe simple mode of electing their captain, adopted by\nthe company, was by placing the candidates apart, and\ntelling the men to go and stand with the one they preferred.\n Lincoln and his competitor took their positions, and then\nthe word was given.

General Whiteside\nhimself immediately re-enlisted as a private, as did also\nCaptain Lincoln. Lincoln, at that time a\n representative in Congress, delivered a speech before the\nHouse, which, in its allusions to General Cass, was\nexquisitely sarcastic and irresistibly humorous. Lincoln, \u201cdo you know I am a\nmilitary hero.

The\nslave states, conscious that power was departing from\nthem, were desperate in their e\ufb00orts and fruitful in their\nexpedients to retain it. There\nwas a double bitterness in this measure to those interested\nin the perpetuation of the in\ufb02uence of slavery in national\na\ufb00airs.

It is\neasy, in looking back, to see how wretched a basis these\nmeasures furnished for peace between freedom and\nslavery; but the best men and the most patriotic men of the\ntime found nothing better. Lincoln shared in the desire that these\nmeasures should be the \ufb01nal settlement of the slavery\nquestion in the country, or believed it possible that they\ncould be, is not known. Although he consented to stand on\nthe Scott electoral ticket in 1852, he does not seem to have\ngone into the canvass with his characteristic earnestness.\nHis party had committed him, in advance, to silence on the\nsubject of slavery; and it was quite possible that he was\nwilling to see how much could be done towards sti\ufb02ing\nwhat seemed to be a fruitless agitation. Events occurred of\nimmeasurable in\ufb02uence upon the country; and an agitation\n of the slavery question was begun which was destined not\nto \ncease \nuntil \nslavery \nitself \nshould \nbe \ndestroyed.\nDisregarding the pledges of peace and harmony, the party\nin the interest of slavery e\ufb00ected in Congress the\nabrogation of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 \u2014 a\ncompromise which was intended to shut slavery forever out\nof the north-west; and a bill organizing the territories of\nKansas and Nebraska was enacted, which left them free to\nchoose whether they would have slavery as an institution or\nnot. The intention, without doubt, was to force slavery upon\nthose territories \u2014 to make it impossible for them ever to\nbecome free states \u2014 as the subsequent exhibitions of\n\u201cborder ru\ufb00ianism\u201d in Kansas su\ufb00iciently testi\ufb01ed. It was at this time that he fully\ncomprehended the fact that there was to be no peace on\nthe slavery question until either freedom or slavery should\ntriumph. He knew slavery to be wrong. Slavery was\nright. Slavery was entitled to equal consideration with\nfreedom. Slavery claimed the privilege of going wherever,\ninto the national domain, it might choose to go. Slavery\nclaimed \nnational \nprotection \neverywhere. The men who, in good\nfaith, had acquiesced in the compromise measures, though\nwith great reluctance and only for the sake of peace \u2014 who\nhad compelled themselves to silence by biting their lips \u2014\nwho had been forced into silence by their love of the Union\nwhose existence the slave power had threatened \u2014 saw\nthat they had been over-reached and foully wronged. Douglas had urged that the people of\nIllinois had no interest in the question of slavery in the\nterritories \u2014 that it concerned only the people of the\nterritories. Lincoln opposed\nthis on the broad ground of humanity and the terms of the\ndeclaration of independence; but to bring the matter more\ndirectly home, and to show that the people of Illinois had a\npractical interest in the question of slavery in the\nterritories, he said:\n\u201cBy the Constitution, each state has two senators \u2014 each\nhas a number of representatives in proportion to the\nnumber of its people, and each has a number of\npresidential electors, equal to the whole number of its\nrepresentatives and senators together. But in ascertaining\nthe number of the people for the purpose, \ufb01ve slaves are\ncounted as being equal to three whites. This\nis all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has\n387,984 slaves. And if they shall think, as I\ndo, that the extension of slavery endangers them more than\nany or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if they\nsubmit the question, and with it, the fate of their country, to\na mere handful of men bent only on temporary self-\ninterest.

Opposition to the\nextension and encroachments of slavery was sectional, and\nany party which exercised this opposition, however broad\nits views might be, was necessarily sectional.\nHis hatred of slavery had been constantly growing, and\nnow he was the member of a party whose avowed purpose\nit was to resist the extension of slavery, and to shut it up in\nthe territory where it held its only rights under the\nConstitution. But the question seemed to\ninspire him, and he went on to show what free institutions\nhad done for himself; and to exhibit the evils of slavery to\nthe white man wherever it existed, and asked if it was not\nnatural that he should hate slavery, and agitate against it.\u201d\nThe project of making Kansas a slave state was in full\nprogress. A whole party was bowing to the behests of\nslavery, and those who were opposed to the institution and\nthe power born of it had become stupe\ufb01ed in the presence\nof its bold assumptions and rapid advances. A pro-slavery\nlegislature was elected mainly by non-residents, at an\nelection in which the free state men, who numbered three-\nfourths of the entire population, refused to participate, on\n account \nof \nillegality. The\nLecompton Convention framed, of course, a pro-slavery\nconstitution. It was he who had\n given to the slave-power what it had not asked for, but\ncould not consistently refuse.

Of those who were slaves\nat the beginning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand\nwere in the military service of the United States, and about\none-half of them were bearing arms in the ranks. No servile\ninsurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, had marked\nthe measures of emancipation and the arming of the blacks. But, if it be\nproper to require, as a test of admission to the political\nbody, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United\nStates and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and\nproclamations in regard to slavery. I may add, at this point, that while I remain in my\npresent position, I shall not attempt to retract, or modify,\nthe Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that\nproclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.

Now, admitting for the present,\nthat the Rio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana, what,\nunder heaven, had that to do with the present boundary\nbetween us and Mexico.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s next piece of evidence is, that \u2018The\nRepublic of Texas always claimed this river (Rio Grande) as\n her western boundary.\n\u201cThough not in order in which the President presents his\nevidence, I now consider that class of his statements, which\nare, in substance, nothing more than that Texas has by\nvarious acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed the\nRio Grande as her boundary \u2014 on paper. I mean here what\nhe says about the \ufb01xing of the Rio Grande as her boundary,\nin her old Constitution (not her State Constitution,) about\nforming congressional districts, counties, etc.\n\u201cI next consider the President\u2019s statement that Santa\nAnna, in his treaty with Texas, recognized the Rio Grande\nas the western boundary of Texas. It is\n stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate\nthe territory of Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio\nGrande; and in another article it is stipulated, that to\nprevent collisions between the armies, the Texan army\nshould not approach nearer than within \ufb01ve leagues \u2014 of\nwhat is not said \u2014 but clearly, from the object stated, it is\nof the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty recognizing the\nRio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the\nsingular feature of stipulating that Texas shall not go within\n\ufb01ve leagues of her own boundary.\n\u201cNext comes the evidence of Texas before annexation,\nand the United States afterward, exercising jurisdiction\nbeyond the Nueces, and between the two rivers. He tells us it went beyond the Nueces,\nbut he does not tell us it went to the Rio Grande. That Congress did not understand it to extend\nclear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of their\njoint \nresolution \nfor \nadmission \nexpressly \nleaving \nall\nquestions of boundary to future adjustment. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising\njurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and\nMexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the Rio\nGrande, then neither river was the boundary, but the\nuninhabited country between the two was.", "Powerful_And_Famous_1852": " Lincoln as he appeared in those\ndays.

Lincoln regarded slavery as a great\nmoral, social and political wrong.\n\u201cThat while we deprecate all interference on the part of\npolitical organizations with the judiciary, if such action is\nlimited to its appropriate sphere, yet we cannot refrain\nfrom expressing our condemnation of the principles and\n tendencies of the extra-judicial opinions of a majority of the\nJudges of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the\nmatter of Dred Scott, wherein the political heresy is put\nforth that the federal constitution extends slavery into all\nthe territories of the Republic, and so maintains it that\nneither Congress nor the people through the territorial\nlegislature can by law abolish it.\nWe are now far into the \ufb01fth year, since a policy was\ninitiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise of\nputting an end to slavery agitation.\n\u201cThe new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more\nthan half the states by State Constitutions, and from most\nof the national territory by Congressional prohibition. That argument was incorporated into\nthe Nebraska bill itself, in the language which follows: \u2018It\n being the true intent and meaning of this act not to\nlegislate slavery into any territory or state, nor to exclude it\ntherefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own\nway, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said opposition members, \u2018let us amend\nthe bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the\nterritory may exclude slavery.\n\u201cWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress,\na law case involving the question of a negro\u2019s freedom, by\nreason of his owner having voluntarily taken him \ufb01rst into a\nfree state and then into a territory covered by the\nCongressional prohibition, and held him as a slave for a\nlong time in each, was passing through the United States\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both\nNebraska bill and lawsuit Were brought to a decision in the\nsame month of May, 1854. Senator Trumbull, on the \ufb02oor of the Senate,\nrequested the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state\nhis opinion whether the people of a territory can\n constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the\nlatter answers, \u201cThat is a question for the Supreme Court.\n\u201cAt length a squabble springs up between the president\nand the author of the Nebraska bill, on the mere question\nof fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was\nnot, in any just sense, made by the people of Kansas; and in\nthat quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair\nvote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery\n be voted down or voted up.\u2019\n\u201cSecondly, That \u2018subject to the Constitution of the United\nStates,\u2019 neither Congress nor a territorial legislature can\nexclude slavery from any United States territory.\n\u201cThirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual\nslavery in a free state, makes him free, as against the\nholder, the United States courts will not decide, but will\nleave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the\nnegro may be forced into by the master.\n\u201cAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it,\nthe Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate\nand mould public opinion, at least northern public opinion,\nnot to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up.\n\u201cIt should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill,\nthe people of a state as well as territory, were to be left\n\u2018perfectly free,\u2019 \u2018subject only to the Constitution. While the opinion of the court, by Chief\nJustice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate\nopinions of all the concurring judges, expressly declare that\nthe Constitution of the United States neither permits\nCongress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery\n from any United States territory, they all omit to declare\nwhether or not the same Constitution permits a state, or\nthe people of a state, to exclude it. On one occasion, his exact language is, \u2018except in cases\nwhere the power is restrained by the Constitution of the\nUnited States, the law of the state is supreme over the\nsubject of slavery within its jurisdiction. Put this and that\ntogether, and we have another nice little niche, which we\nmay, ere long, see \ufb01lled with another Supreme Court\ndecision, declaring that the Constitution of the United\nStates does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its\nlimits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine\nof \u2018care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up,\u2019\n shall gain upon the public mind su\ufb00iciently to give promise\nthat such a decision can be maintained when made.\n\u201cSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being\nalike lawful in all the states. How can he\noppose the advances of slavery. He has done all in his power to\nreduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right\nof property; and as such, how can he oppose the foreign\nslave trade \u2014 how can he refuse that trade in that\n\u2018property\u2019 shall be \u2018perfectly free\u2019 \u2014 unless he does it as a\nprotection to the home production.

Why declare that within\ntwenty years the African slave trade, by which slaves are\nsupplied, might be cut o\ufb00 by Congress.\n\u201cI have said a hundred times, and I have now no\ninclination to take it back, that I believe there is no right,\n and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free\nstates to enter into the slave states, and interfere with the\nquestion of slavery at all. I have said that always; Judge\nDouglas has heard me say it \u2014 if not quite a hundred times,\nat least as good as a hundred times; and when it is said that\nI am in favor of interfering with slavery where it exists, I\nknow it is unwarranted by anything I have ever intended,\nand, as I believe, by anything I have ever said.\n\u201cHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I\nhope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in\nthe belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that\nI am in favor of Illinois going over and interfering with the\ncranberry laws of Indiana.", "Exclude_Slavery_1860": " Lincoln. Lincoln that he had \u201cleft a\nniche in the Nebraska bill to receive the Dred Scott\ndecision,\u201d which declared in e\ufb00ect, that a territorial\nlegislature could not abolish slavery. Lincoln responded on a\nsubsequent occasion as follows:\n\u201cI say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the\npurpose for Judge Douglas to say that he did not repeal the\nMissouri compromise; that he did not make slavery possible\nwhere it was impossible before; that he did not leave a\nniche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to\nrest in; that he did not vote down a clause giving the people\nthe right to exclude slavery if they wanted to; that he did\nnot refuse to give his individual opinion whether a\nterritorial legislature could exclude slavery; that he did not\nmake a report to the senate in which he said that the rights\nof the people in this regard were held in abeyance, and\ncould not be immediately exercised; that he did not make a\nhasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at\nSpring\ufb01eld; that he does not now indorse that decision;\nthat that decision does not take away from the territorial\nlegislature the power to exclude slavery; and that he did\nnot in the original Nebraska bill so couple the words \u2018state\u2019\nand \u2018territory\u2019 together that what the Supreme Court has\ndone in forcing open all the territories for slavery, it may\nyet do in forcing open all the state; \u2014 I say it would be\nvastly more to the point, for Judge Douglas to say he did\nnot do some of these things, did not forge some of the links\nof overwhelming testimony, than to go to vociferating about\nthe country that possibly he may be obliged to hint that\nsomebody is a liar. Lincoln to dissolve and kill the old\nwhig party, and transfer its members, bound hand and foot,\nto the abolition party, under the direction of Giddings and\nFred Douglass.\nLincoln and the \u201cabolition orators,\u201d he said, \u201che and they\nmaintain that negro equality is guaranteed by the laws of\nGod, and that it is asserted in the Declaration of\nIndependence. Lincoln, related to a very few points,\nwhich may be summed up in a brace of paragraphs. Douglas\nhimself had e\ufb00ected, an unspeakable wrong, a foul breach\nof faith, by which it was rendered possible for the people of\na territory to choose slavery, and by which the forcing of\nslavery upon them was rendered practicable. Thus the fathers regarded and treated slavery. They had forbidden the\nimportation of slaves. All their arrangements looked to an\nearly end of slavery; and Mr. Lincoln quoted the champions\nof slavery to sustain his views on this point. When the\npolicy of the government changed, and it was proposed to\nnationalize slavery and make it perpetual \u2014 to confer upon\nit the same rights with freedom \u2014 nay, to make it\nimpossible for freedom to abolish it \u2014 then he foresaw a\ncon\ufb02ict which could only end by its utter overthrow, or its\nuniversal prevalence. Trumbull, that he was responsible\nfor a certain set of anti-slavery resolutions, and that the\nresolutions which he read were passed by the convention\nthat was held at Spring\ufb01eld, was false in every particular. Lincoln\u2019s reply, he quoted from his Peoria speech\nmade in 1854, to which allusion has been made in this\nhistory, to show his exact position on the subject of slavery\nin the states where it existed. \u201cIf\nslavery did not now exist among them, they would not\nintroduce it.\u201d He understood how di\ufb00icult it was to\nget rid of slavery, and he did not blame them for not doing\n what he should not know how to do himself. This, notwithstanding he hated slavery for the\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself, and for its disgrace to\ndemocratic institutions. But all these facts had no e\ufb00ect\nupon his mind when he came to consider the question of\nextending slavery over territory now free. There was no\nmore excuse, in his opinion, for permitting slavery to go\ninto free territory, than for reviving the African slave-trade\nby law. \u201cThe law which forbids the bringing a slave from\nAfrica,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cand that which has so long\nforbidden the taking of them to Nebraska, can hardly be\ndistinguished, on any moral principle. It is simply\nfor the Supreme Court to say that no state under the\nConstitution can exclude slavery, and he must bow to the\ndecision, just as when it says no territory can thus exclude\nit. Lincoln made these replies, seriatim: that he was not\nthen, and never had been pledged to the unconditional\nrepeal of the fugitive slave law; that he was not then, and\nhad never been, pledged against the admission of any more\nslave states; that he did not stand pledged against the\nadmission of a new state into the Union with such a\nconstitution as the people of that state may see \ufb01t to make;\nthat he did not stand pledged to the abolition of slavery in\nthe District of Columbia; that he did not stand pledged to\nthe prohibition of the slave trade between the di\ufb00erent\nstates; and that he was pledged to a belief in the right and\nduty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States\nterritories. He believed the\nsouthern people were entitled, under the Constitution, to a\n congressional fugitive slave law; said that he should be\nvery sorry to see any more slave states applying for\nadmission to the Union, and declared that he would not\nonly be glad to see slavery abolished in the District of\nColumbia, \nbut \nhe \nbelieved \nthat \nCongress \nhad \nthe\nconstitutional power to abolish it there. Can the people of a United States territory, in any\nlawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United\nStates, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation\nof a state constitution. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall\ndecide that states cannot exclude slavery from their limits,\nare you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting and following\nsuch decision, as a rule of political action. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in\ndisregard of how such acquisition may a\ufb00ect the nation on\nthe slavery question. His answer to the second question was in brief\nthis: \u201cIt matters not what way the Supreme Court may\nhereafter decide, as to the abstract question whether\nslavery may or may not go into a territory under the\nConstitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce\nit, or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery\ncannot exist a day, or an hour, anywhere, unless it is\nsupported by local police regulations.\u201d The third question he answered by stating\nthat a decision of the Supreme Court that states could not\nexclude slavery from their limits, would \u201cbe an act of moral\ntreason that no man on the bench would ever descend to.\nThe question has been decided by the Supreme Court, and\nnow the Judge, by saying that the people can exclude\nslavery if they choose, virtually says that it is not a question\nfor the Supreme Court but a question for the people. The\nproposition that \u201cslavery cannot exist a day or an hour\nwithout local police regulations\u201d is historically false, even\nin the case of Dred Scott himself, who was held in\nMinnesota territory not only without police regulations, but\nin the teeth of Congressional legislation, supposed to be\nvalid at the time. Standing on the ground that slavery\nwas wrong and that its perpetuation would be a calamity,\nand its di\ufb00usion through new territory a crime, Mr. Lincoln. The man who shall write\nthe story of the great rebellion on behalf of human slavery\n must go back to these masterly speeches of an Illinois\nlawyer to \ufb01nd the clearest and most complete statement of\nthose di\ufb00erences between the power of slavery, and the\nspirit of freedom \u2014 the policy of slavery and the policy of\nfreedom \u2014 which ended, after expenditures of uncounted\ntreasure and unmeasured blood, in the \ufb01nal overthrow of\nthe accursed institution.", "Judge_Douglas_1858": " Lincoln\u2019s\nhistory was his contest with Senator Douglas, in 1858, for\nthe seat in the United States Senate which was soon to be\nvacated by the expiration of the term for which the latter\nwas elected.

Douglas having foreseen its character, and\nhaving virtually committed himself to it in advance \u2014\nhaving, indeed, undertaken to make the republican party\nmorally responsible for its existence and adoption, a\nchange seems to have come over his opinions.

They averred that he adhered to the outrageous\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case \u2014\nthat a negro cannot sue in a United States court, and that\nCongress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories \u2014 and\nthat they dared not trust Mr. Douglas.

Douglas. Douglas had the sympathy of\nmany republicans abroad, he had attacked a hated\nadministration with great vigor and persistence, he had the\nenmity of that administration, and, in the state, he had the\nadvantage of an unjust apportionment of legislative\ndistricts, by which not less than ninety-three thousand\npeople were virtually disfranchised. Douglas had already declared that it was the\nintention to use Mr. Douglas\u2019 term of o\ufb00ice.\n \u201cLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now\nalmost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so\nto speak \u2014 compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the\nDred Scott decision.

Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent\nJudge Douglas\u2019 position, question his motives, or do aught\nthat can be personally o\ufb00ensive to him. Douglas made a speech in\nChicago. Douglas endeavored to make was\nas illegitimate as his previous one, viz: that Mr. Douglas, \u201cby which\nhe proposes to take an appeal from the decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States upon this high\nconstitutional question, to a republican caucus sitting in\nthe country.

Douglas had\nmet on the previous evening. Douglas\u2019 speech and treated them\nfully.\u201d\nThe next point touched upon was Judge Douglas\u2019 charge\nthat Mr. I have\nsaid, very many times, in Judge Douglas\u2019 hearing, that no\nman believed more than I in the principle of self-\ngovernment; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just\ngovernment, from beginning to end.\n\u201cHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I\nhope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in\nthe belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that\nI am in favor of Illinois going over and interfering with the\ncranberry laws of Indiana. What is fairly implied by the\nterm Judge Douglas has used, \u2018resistance to the decision. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his\nmaster, I would be interfering with property, and that\nterrible di\ufb00iculty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\ninterfering with property would arise. Judge Douglas said last night,\nthat before the decision he might advance his opinion, and\nit might be contrary to the decision when it was made; but\nafter it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed. We will try to put it where\nJudge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it\nuntil it is reversed.\n\u201cThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this\ndecision, is a degree of sacredness that has never been\nbefore thrown around any other decision.\nBut Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary\ncircumstances, and give their vote in Congress in\naccordance with it, yield to it and obey it in every possible\nsense. I will venture here to\nsay, that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved\nof General Jackson for that act. Douglas had put\nforth as his own invention was something which, when\nproperly de\ufb01ned, the republicans had always accepted and\nacted upon, and that it came, not from Judge Douglas, but\nfrom the Declaration of Independence, which states that\ngovernments derive their just powers \u201cfrom the consent of\nthe governed,\u201d he alluded to the defeat of the Lecompton\nConstitution in Congress.

Douglas had not been present at Mr. Douglas spoke at Spring\ufb01eld, as did also Mr. Douglas had\nbeen looking upon him as certain, at no distant day, to be\nthe President of the United States.\u201d The main body of the speech was devoted to\nthe questions at issue between him and Judge Douglas, and\ndoes not contain matter of special interest beyond what he\nhad previously uttered upon the same points. Douglas was a party to the conspiracy\n for deceiving the people with the idea that the settlers of a\nterritory could exclude slavery from their limits if they\nshould choose to do so, and, at the same time, rendering it\nimpossible for them to do so through the standing veto of\nthe Dred Scott decision. Douglas had ignored it.", "Judge_Douglas_1860": " Douglas had\ngiven him. Douglas, and agreeing to speak in the seven places\nmentioned.

Douglas, \u201cto an answer, for I quote from the\nplatform of the republican party, made by himself (Lincoln)\nand others at the time that party was formed, and the\nbargain made by Mr. Douglas went on then to comment on Mr. Douglas,\nas well as those of Mr. Douglas did not believe in natural negro equality, and\ndid believe that every state had the right to say just what\nrights she would confer upon the negro; that the people of\nevery territory had a right to decide as to what their\n institutions should be, while he bowed, at the same time, to\nthe Dred Scott decision, which declared that they had no\nright to abolish slavery; and that the country could endure\nhalf slave and half free as well for all coming time as it had\nfor the previous eighty years, while slavery itself, to him,\nwas a matter of indi\ufb00erence \u2014 an institution which might\nbe \u201cvoted up or voted down,\u201d without any appeal to his\npreferences.

Douglas had quoted had not been\npassed in Spring\ufb01eld at all, by any convention, and that,\nalthough they had been uttered by a local convention in the\ntown of Aurora, they were, for the purposes used, and\nunder the circumstances, essentially a forgery, for which\nMr. Douglas know it to be so.\u201d The principal point\nurged against Judge Douglas in this speech touched his\ndevotion to Supreme Court decisions. And I\nremind him of another piece of history on the question of\nrespect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois\nhistory, belonging to a time when the large party to which\nJudge Douglas belonged were displeased with a decision of\nthe Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided\nthat a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You\nwill \ufb01nd the whole story in Ford\u2019s History of Illinois; and I\nknow that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in\nfavor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding\n\ufb01ve new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. It was in this way precisely that he got his\n title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men\nappointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will\nhave to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say,\n\u2018You know, Judge; you have tried it.\u2019 When he says a court\nof this kind will lose the con\ufb01dence of all men, will be\nprostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \u2018You\nknoW best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\u2019 But I\ncannot shake Judge Douglas\u2019 teeth loose from the Dred\nScott decision. Douglas employed\nin his reply to Mr. Douglas\u2019 questions \u2014 these and the remainder \u2014 in\naccordance with opinions with which the reader is already\nfamiliar, he was ready to turn questioner, and give the\nJudge something to do, in the same line of e\ufb00ort.\nDouglas\u2019 doctrine of popular sovereignty, in connection\nwith the Dred Scott decision \u2014 the two things in his\njudgment being in direct antagonism, and being, in reality,\na shameful fraud. Douglas with changing his\nground; and referred to the record to prove his charge.

Lincoln responded on a\nsubsequent occasion as follows:\n\u201cI say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the\npurpose for Judge Douglas to say that he did not repeal the\nMissouri compromise; that he did not make slavery possible\nwhere it was impossible before; that he did not leave a\nniche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to\nrest in; that he did not vote down a clause giving the people\nthe right to exclude slavery if they wanted to; that he did\nnot refuse to give his individual opinion whether a\nterritorial legislature could exclude slavery; that he did not\nmake a report to the senate in which he said that the rights\nof the people in this regard were held in abeyance, and\ncould not be immediately exercised; that he did not make a\nhasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at\nSpring\ufb01eld; that he does not now indorse that decision;\nthat that decision does not take away from the territorial\nlegislature the power to exclude slavery; and that he did\nnot in the original Nebraska bill so couple the words \u2018state\u2019\nand \u2018territory\u2019 together that what the Supreme Court has\ndone in forcing open all the territories for slavery, it may\nyet do in forcing open all the state; \u2014 I say it would be\nvastly more to the point, for Judge Douglas to say he did\nnot do some of these things, did not forge some of the links\nof overwhelming testimony, than to go to vociferating about\nthe country that possibly he may be obliged to hint that\nsomebody is a liar.

Douglas\u2019 charges. You\nwill \ufb01nd the whole story in Ford\u2019s History of Illinois; and I\nknow that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in\nfavor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding\n\ufb01ve new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones.\u2019 But I\ncannot shake Judge Douglas\u2019 teeth loose from the Dred\nScott decision.\nHe hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision.

Douglas\u2019 position; but\nhe would not have them at the price Mr. Douglas had paid\nfor them. Douglas in his elevation. Douglas looked upon slavery either\n with indi\ufb00erence or approval. Douglas having foreseen its character, and\nhaving virtually committed himself to it in advance \u2014\nhaving, indeed, undertaken to make the republican party\nmorally responsible for its existence and adoption, a\nchange seems to have come over his opinions. Douglas in his\nposition as an anti-Lecompton man. Douglas at home, and who had\nwitnessed his bold and gallant \ufb01ght with the administration\nand the slave-power in the senate, expressed the wish that\ntheir friends in Illinois might \ufb01nd it in the line of their duty\nto aid in returning him to the senate. They averred that he adhered to the outrageous\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case \u2014\nthat a negro cannot sue in a United States court, and that\nCongress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories \u2014 and\nthat they dared not trust Mr. Douglas. Douglas was too\nremote and uncertain to warrant them in abandoning an\norganization which had been formed to advance a great\nand just cause, and Which, once dissolved, could not be re-\nformed in time to render e\ufb00icient service in the election of\n 1860. Douglas gained any appreciable advantage from the\ncontroversy, or the sympathy of republicans in other states. The \ufb01fth\nresolution adopted on this occasion covers the grand issue\nmade with Judge Douglas.\n\u201cThat while we deprecate all interference on the part of\npolitical organizations with the judiciary, if such action is\nlimited to its appropriate sphere, yet we cannot refrain\nfrom expressing our condemnation of the principles and\n tendencies of the extra-judicial opinions of a majority of the\nJudges of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the\nmatter of Dred Scott, wherein the political heresy is put\nforth that the federal constitution extends slavery into all\nthe territories of the Republic, and so maintains it that\nneither Congress nor the people through the territorial\nlegislature can by law abolish it. Lincoln, as their\nnominee in opposition to Mr. Douglas. Douglas had the sympathy of\nmany republicans abroad, he had attacked a hated\nadministration with great vigor and persistence, he had the\nenmity of that administration, and, in the state, he had the\nadvantage of an unjust apportionment of legislative\ndistricts, by which not less than ninety-three thousand\npeople were virtually disfranchised. Douglas had already declared that it was the\nintention to use Mr. Abraham Lincoln is our \ufb01rst and only choice\nfor United States Senator, to \ufb01ll the vacancy about to be\ncreated by the expiration of Mr. Douglas\u2019 term of o\ufb00ice.\n \u201cLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now\nalmost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so\nto speak \u2014 compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the\nDred Scott decision.\n\u201cWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress,\na law case involving the question of a negro\u2019s freedom, by\nreason of his owner having voluntarily taken him \ufb01rst into a\nfree state and then into a territory covered by the\nCongressional prohibition, and held him as a slave for a\nlong time in each, was passing through the United States\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both\nNebraska bill and lawsuit Were brought to a decision in the\nsame month of May, 1854. The negro\u2019s name was \u2018Dred\nScott,\u2019 which name now designates the decision \ufb01nally\nmade in the case.\n\u201cThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in\nconnection with Senator Douglas\u2019 \u2018care not\u2019 policy,\nconstitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of\nadvancement. This point is made,\nnot to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for\nawhile, and apparently indorsed by the people at an\nelection, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what\nDred Scott\u2019s master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in\nthe free state of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do\nwith any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in\nany other free state.\n\u201cThere are those who denounce us openly to their own\nfriends, and yet whisper us softly that Senator Douglas is\nthe aptest instrument there is with which to e\ufb00ect that\nobject.\u2019 Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this\nwork, is at least a caged and toothless one.\n\u201cSenator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may\nrightfully be wiser to-day than he was yesterday \u2014 that he\nmay rightfully change when he \ufb01nds himself wrong. Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent\nJudge Douglas\u2019 position, question his motives, or do aught\nthat can be personally o\ufb00ensive to him. Douglas made a speech in\nChicago. Douglas endeavored to make was\nas illegitimate as his previous one, viz: that Mr. Lincoln\u2019s criticism of the Dred Scott\ndecision, and, by his treatment of it, fully vindicated the\n action of the Illinois republicans in their refusal to support\nhim in accordance with the wishes of their eastern friends. Douglas, \u201cby which\nhe proposes to take an appeal from the decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States upon this high\nconstitutional question, to a republican caucus sitting in\nthe country. Douglas did not see \ufb01t to allude in\nthis speech to Mr. Douglas went farther than simply to indorse the Dred\nScott decision, and to declare his intention to sustain it. Lincoln for resisting the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the Dred Scott case does not, in itself, meet my\napprobation. Douglas\u2019 opinion. Douglas made in his\nChicago speech. Douglas had\nmet on the previous evening. Douglas\u2019 speech and treated them\nfully.\u201d\nThe next point touched upon was Judge Douglas\u2019 charge\nthat Mr. I have\nsaid, very many times, in Judge Douglas\u2019 hearing, that no\nman believed more than I in the principle of self-\ngovernment; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just\ngovernment, from beginning to end.\n\u201cHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I\nhope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in\nthe belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that\nI am in favor of Illinois going over and interfering with the\ncranberry laws of Indiana. What is fairly implied by the\nterm Judge Douglas has used, \u2018resistance to the decision. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his\nmaster, I would be interfering with property, and that\nterrible di\ufb00iculty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\ninterfering with property would arise. Judge Douglas said last night,\nthat before the decision he might advance his opinion, and\nit might be contrary to the decision when it was made; but\nafter it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed. We will try to put it where\nJudge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it\nuntil it is reversed.\n\u201cThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this\ndecision, is a degree of sacredness that has never been\nbefore thrown around any other decision.\nBut Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary\ncircumstances, and give their vote in Congress in\naccordance with it, yield to it and obey it in every possible\nsense. I will venture here to\nsay, that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved\nof General Jackson for that act. Douglas had put\nforth as his own invention was something which, when\nproperly de\ufb01ned, the republicans had always accepted and\nacted upon, and that it came, not from Judge Douglas, but\nfrom the Declaration of Independence, which states that\ngovernments derive their just powers \u201cfrom the consent of\nthe governed,\u201d he alluded to the defeat of the Lecompton\nConstitution in Congress. He said that the republicans took\nground against the Lecompton Constitution long before\nJudge Douglas did, and that he held in his hand a speech in\n which he urged the same reason against Douglas the year\nbefore that he (Douglas) was urging now.\n\u201cA voice\u2014 \u2018Judge Douglas.\n\u201cA voice\u2014 \u2018Douglas. Lincoln \u2014 Why, yes, Douglas did it. The\nrepublicans could not have done it without Judge Douglas.\u201d\nThe following point was so neatly made that it drew from\nthe house three hearty cheers:\n\u201cWe were often \u2014 more than once at least \u2014 in the\ncourse of Judge Douglas\u2019 speech last night, reminded that\nthis government was made for white men \u2014 that he\nbelieved it was made for white men. Douglas had not been present at Mr. Douglas spoke at Spring\ufb01eld, as did also Mr. Douglas had\nbeen looking upon him as certain, at no distant day, to be\nthe President of the United States.\u201d The main body of the speech was devoted to\nthe questions at issue between him and Judge Douglas, and\ndoes not contain matter of special interest beyond what he\nhad previously uttered upon the same points. Douglas was a party to the conspiracy\n for deceiving the people with the idea that the settlers of a\nterritory could exclude slavery from their limits if they\nshould choose to do so, and, at the same time, rendering it\nimpossible for them to do so through the standing veto of\nthe Dred Scott decision. Douglas had ignored it.", "Territorial_Legislature_1858": " We hold that Congress\npossesses sovereign power over the territories, and has the\nright to govern and control them whilst they remain in a\nterritorial condition, and that it is the duty of the general\ngovernment to protect the territories from the curse of\nslavery, and to preserve the public domain for the\noccupation of free men and free labor; and we declare that\nno power on earth can carry and maintain slavery in the\nstates against the will of their people and the provisions of\ntheir constitutions and laws; and we fully indorse the\nrecent decision of the Supreme Court of our own state,\nwhich declares that property in persons is repugnant to the\nConstitution and laws of Illinois, and that all persons within\nits jurisdiction are presumed to be free, and that slavery,\nwhere it exists, is a municipal regulation, without any\nextra-territorial operation.\n\u201cIt should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill,\nthe people of a state as well as territory, were to be left\n\u2018perfectly free,\u2019 \u2018subject only to the Constitution. They were legislating for territories, and\nnot for or about states. Certainly the people of a state are\nand ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United\nStates; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely\nterritorial law. Why are the people of a territory and the\npeople of a state therein lumped together, and their\nrelation to the Constitution therein treated as being\nprecisely the same.\n\u201cSo much then as to my disposition \u2014 my wish \u2014 to have\nall the state legislatures blotted out, and to have one\nconsolidated government, and a uniformity of domestic\nregulations in all the states by which I suppose it is meant,\nif we raise corn here, we must make sugar-cane grow here\ntoo, and we must make those which grow North grow in the\nSouth.\u201d\nAnd thus was opened the grand senatorial campaign of\n1858.", "Territorial_Legislature_1860": " Lincoln that he had \u201cleft a\nniche in the Nebraska bill to receive the Dred Scott\ndecision,\u201d which declared in e\ufb00ect, that a territorial\nlegislature could not abolish slavery. Lincoln responded on a\nsubsequent occasion as follows:\n\u201cI say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the\npurpose for Judge Douglas to say that he did not repeal the\nMissouri compromise; that he did not make slavery possible\nwhere it was impossible before; that he did not leave a\nniche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to\nrest in; that he did not vote down a clause giving the people\nthe right to exclude slavery if they wanted to; that he did\nnot refuse to give his individual opinion whether a\nterritorial legislature could exclude slavery; that he did not\nmake a report to the senate in which he said that the rights\nof the people in this regard were held in abeyance, and\ncould not be immediately exercised; that he did not make a\nhasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at\nSpring\ufb01eld; that he does not now indorse that decision;\nthat that decision does not take away from the territorial\nlegislature the power to exclude slavery; and that he did\nnot in the original Nebraska bill so couple the words \u2018state\u2019\nand \u2018territory\u2019 together that what the Supreme Court has\ndone in forcing open all the territories for slavery, it may\nyet do in forcing open all the state; \u2014 I say it would be\nvastly more to the point, for Judge Douglas to say he did\nnot do some of these things, did not forge some of the links\nof overwhelming testimony, than to go to vociferating about\nthe country that possibly he may be obliged to hint that\nsomebody is a liar. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in\ndisregard of how such acquisition may a\ufb00ect the nation on\nthe slavery question. Douglas replied that he held it a\nsound role, of universal application, to require a territory to\ncontain the requisite population for a member of Congress,\nbefore it is admitted as a state into the Union; but it having\n been decided by Congress that Kansas had population\nenough for a slave state, he held that she had enough for a\nfree state.", "Presidential_Election_1858": " Lincoln\u2019s\nhistory was his contest with Senator Douglas, in 1858, for\nthe seat in the United States Senate which was soon to be\nvacated by the expiration of the term for which the latter\nwas elected.

The fall\nof Sumter, the inaugural of President Lincoln and the\nfailure of the confederate commissioners to secure a treaty\n were used in di\ufb00erent ways to in\ufb02ame southern pride, and\nloosen the love of the loyal members from the old Union.

The passage is too important to be abbreviated:\n\u201cIt might seem, at \ufb01rst thought, to be of little di\ufb00erence\nwhether the present movement at the South be called\n\u201csecession,\u201d or \u201crebellion.\n\u201cWith rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been\ndrugging the public mind of their section for more than\nthirty years, and until at length they have brought many\ngood men to a willingness to take up arms against the\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have\nenacted the farcical pretence of taking their state out of the\nUnion, who could haye been brought to no such thing the\nday before. It remained to be demonstrated to the world\nthat those who could fairly carry an election could also\nsuppress a rebellion\u2014 \u201cthat ballots are the rightful and\n peaceful successors to bullets, and that when ballots have\nfairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no\nsuccessful appeal back to bullets \u2014 that there can be no\nsuccessful \nappeal, \nexcept \nto \nballots \nthemselves, \nat\nsucceeding elections.

Crittenden of Kentucky \u2014 that the war\nhad been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the\nsouthern states, then in revolt against the constitutional\ngovernment and in arms around the capital: that Congress,\n banishing all feeling of passion or resentment, would\nrecollect only its duty to the whole country: that the war\nwas not waged on the part of the government in the spirit\nof oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or\nsubjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering\nwith the rights or established institutions of the states; but\nto defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution,\nand to preserve the Union, with all the dignities, equality\nand rights of the several states unimpaired: and that as\nsoon as those objects were accomplished, the war ought to\ncease.

Whatever may be the professions of\nEngland now, no true American can forget that all the\nin\ufb02uence she dared to give in favor of the rebellion was\ngiven, beginning promptly at the start; and that her\nposition rendered the task of subduing the rebellion doubly\nsevere. The civil administration of the state was altogether\nunreliable; and on the thirty-\ufb01rst of August, General\nFremont issued a proclamation declaring martial law,\nde\ufb01ning the lines of the army of occupation, and\nthreatening with death by the bullet all who should be\nfound within those lines with arms in their hands. The proclaiming of freedom to the slaves of\nrebels struck the popular chord, particularly among\nthoroughly loyal men in the free states. Of course, it\nmaddened \nall \nthe \nsympathizers \nwith \nthe \nrebellion,\ninfuriated the rebels themselves, and perplexed those loyal\nmen who had upon their hands the task of so conducting\n a\ufb00airs as to hold to their allegiance the border slave states\nwhich had not seceded. He,\ntherefore, wished General Fremont, as of his own motion,\nso to modify his proclamation as to make it conformable to\nthe con\ufb01scation act just passed by the extra session of\nCongress, which only freed such slaves as were engaged in\nthe rebel service. \u201cJe\ufb00 Thompson,\nBrigadier General of the \ufb01rst military district of Missouri,\u201d\nacting under the state government, did \u201cmost solemnly\npromise\u201d that for every soldier of the state guard, \u201cor\nsoldier of our allies, the armies of the confederate States,\u201d\nwho should be put to death under the proclamation, he\nwould \u201chang, draw and quarter a minion of Abraham\nLincoln. This the President did, in a dispatch under\ndate of September eleventh, in the words: \u201cIt is therefore\nordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so\nmodi\ufb01ed, held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to\ntranscend, the provisions on the same subject contained in\nthe act of Congress entitled, \u2018An act to con\ufb01scate property\nused for insurrectionary purposes,\u2019 approved August 6,\n1861; and that such act be published at length with this\norder. In a letter dated November \ufb01rst, the\nPresident acceded to his request, and added: \u201cThe\nAmerican people will hear with sadness and deep emotion\nthat General Scott has withdrawn from the active control of\nthe army, while the President and the unanimous Cabinet\nexpress their own and the nation\u2019s sympathy in his personal\na\ufb04iction, and their profound sense of the important public\nservices rendered by him to his country, during his long\nand brilliant public career, among which will ever be\ngratefully distinguished his faithful devotion to the\nConstitution, the Union and the \ufb02ag, when assailed by\nparricidal rebellion.\u201d To do all possible honor to the noble\nveteran who had stood by the country when so many army\n o\ufb00icers had gone over to the rebellion under the appeal of\nsectional friendship \u2014 an appeal made to him with all the\npersuasions that ingenuity could devise \u2014 the President\nand his entire Cabinet waited upon him at his residence;\nand there, with his Secretaries around him, Mr. \nGenerals \nGrant \nand\nMcClernand, with a force of three thousand \ufb01ve hundred\nmen, attacked a rebel camp in Missouri under General\nPolk, captured twelve guns, burned their camp, and took\nbaggage, horses and many prisoners. The rebels were\nafterwards reinforced, and compelled the Union forces to\nreturn to their transports.

But if the\ndestruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\nstates be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than\nbefore, the Constitution having lost the vital element of\nperpetuity.\n\u201cIt follows from these views that no state, upon its own\nmere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union; that\nresolves and ordinances to that e\ufb00ect are legally void; and\nthat acts of violence within any state or states against the\nauthority of the United States are insurrectionary or\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\n\u201cI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and\nthe laws, the Union is unbroken, and, to the extent of my\nability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly\nenjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union shall be\nfaithfully executed in all the states.\n\u201cI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as\nthe \ndeclared \npurpose \nof \nthe \nUnion \nthat \nit \nwill\nconstitutionally defend and maintain itself.\n\u201cThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished\nin all parts of the Union.\n\u201cThat there are persons, in one section or another, who\nseek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any\npretext to do it, I will neither a\ufb00irm nor deny.\n\u201cTo those, however, who really love the Union, may I not\nspeak, before entering upon so grave a matter as the\ndestruction of our national fabric, with all its bene\ufb01ts, its\nmemories, and its hopes.

They tried\nto induce McClellan to aid in this business; and, at one time\nin October, he agreed to send four thousand men to co-\noperate with a naval force for this purpose; but he falsi\ufb01ed\nhis promise, on the ground that his engineers told him that\nso large a force could not be landed.\nThe con\ufb01dence in General McClellan on the part of the\ngovernment and the country generally was at this time\nunbounded; and he could not appear among his soldiers\nwithout such demonstrations of enthusiastic a\ufb00ection as\nfew commanders have ever received. On the \ufb01rst of\nNovember he succeeded General Scott in the command of\nall the armies of the Union, still retaining personal\ncommand of the Army of the Potomac; but he seemed to be\nunable to move. Lincoln was determined to break the spell which\nseemed to hold the General\u2019s mind; and, on the twenty-\nseventh of January, he issued an order that on the twenty-\nsecond day of February, 1862, there should be a general\n movement of the land and naval forces of the United States,\nagainst the insurgent armies \u2014 especially the army at and\nabout Fortress Monroe, the army of the Potomac, the army\nof \nWestern \nVirginia, \nthe \narmy \nnear \nMumfordsville,\nKentucky, the army and \ufb02otilla at Cairo, and a naval force\nin the gulf of Mexico. He further declared \u201cthat the heads\nof departments, and especially the Secretaries of War and\nof the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the General-in-\nChief with all other commanders and subordinates of land\nand naval forces, will severally be held to their strict and\nfull responsibilities for prompt execution of this order.\nTo this last order of the President, General McClellan\nreplied in a long letter to the Secretary of War. Lincoln addressed a note to the General on\nthis di\ufb00erence of opinion; which ought to have shown him\nthat his superior was a competent adviser and a keen critic:\n\u201cMy dear Sir: \u2014 You and I have distinct and di\ufb00erent\nplans for a movement of the army of the Potomac; yours to\nbe done by the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock, to\nUrbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on\nthe York River; mine to move directly to a point on the\nrailroad \nsouth-west \nof \nManassas.\u201d\nGeneral McClellan replied to this through the Secretary\nof War, after his fashion; but the President was not\n convinced, and \ufb01nally agreed to submit the two plans to a\ncouncil of twelve o\ufb00icers.\nOn the eighth of March, the President ordered General\nMcClellan to organize that part of his army which he\nproposed to engage in active operations, into four Army\nCorps, \nto \nbe \ncommanded \nrespectively \nby \nGeneral\nMcDowell, General Sumner, General Heintzelman and\nGeneral Keyes; and directed the order to be executed with\nsuch \ndispatch \nas \nnot \nto \ndelay \noperations \nalready\ndetermined on \u2014 alluding to the movement by the\nChesapeake and Rappahannock.\nOn the next day, as has already been stated, the enemy\nretired unsuspected and undisturbed from his defenses;\nand then General McClellan moved forward, not to pursue,\naccording to his own authority, but to give his troops some\nexercise, and a taste of the march and bivouac, before more\n active operations.\nOn the eleventh of March, General McClellan was\nrelieved from the command of other military departments,\nbecause he had personally taken the \ufb01eld. Major-General\nHalleck received the command of the department of the\nMississippi, and General Fremont that of the mountain\ndepartment. Stanton wrote to General McClellan, stating\nthat the President saw no objection to the plan, but\ndirecting that such a force should be left at Manassas\nJunction as would make it entirely certain that the enemy\nshould not repossess it, that Washington should be left\nsecure, and that, whatever place might be chosen as the\nnew base, the army should move at once in pursuit of the\nenemy, by some route. Lincoln ordered\nBlenker\u2019s division from the army of the Potomac to join\nGeneral Fremont, who had importuned him for a larger\nforce, and who was supported in his request by exacting\nfriends. In a note to General McClellan, he said,\u2014 \u201cI write\nthis to assure you that I did so with great pain,\nunderstanding that you would wish it otherwise.\u201d General Banks, who had been\nordered to cover Washington by occupying Manassas, was\nordered on the \ufb01rst of April to force General Jackson back\nfrom Winchester.\nTransportation had already been provided by the War\nDepartment for moving the troops to any new base that\nmight be determined on, and General McClellan was not\nobliged to wait. In\nall the orders given by the President concerning the\nmovements of this army, there was one condition that he\ninsisted upon, viz, that troops should be left su\ufb00icient to\nprotect Washington; and by General McClellan\u2019s order only\ntwenty thousand e\ufb00ective men were to be left with General\nWadsworth, the military governor of the District. The force\nwas much smaller than was necessary, according to\nGeneral McClellan\u2019s previous calculations; and General\nWadsworth was so much impressed with its inadequacy\nthat he called the attention of the war department to the\n subject. The letter was referred to Adjutant-general\nThomas and General E. Hitchcock, whose decision was\nembodied in the words: \u201cIn view of the opinion expressed\nby the council of the commanders of army corps, of the\nforce necessary for the capital, though not numerically\nstated, and of the force represented by General McClellan\nas left for that purpose, we are of opinion that the\nrequirement of the President that this city shall be left\nentirely secure, not only in the opinion of the General-in-\nChief, but that of the commanders of all the army corps\nalso, has not been fully complied with.\u201d In the meantime,\nGeneral McClellan had gone forward to Fortress Monroe,\nand all but two corps of the troops had left for the new\nbase. Two new\nmilitary departments were at once erected \u2014 the\nDepartment \nof \nthe \nRappahannock, \nunder \nGeneral\nMcDowell, and the Department of the Shenandoah, lying\nbetween the mountain department and the Blue Ridge,\nunder General Banks.\nGeneral McClellan pushed a portion of his troops toward\nYorktown at once \u2014 toward a line of intrenchments held by\n the enemy, stretching across the Peninsula. No one\ndoubts now that General McClellan\u2019s cautiousness betrayed\nhis judgment, and that a strong and well-directed attack\nwould have swept the rebels out or their works.\nStanton\u2019s \ndispatch, \nGeneral \nMcClellan \nwrote \nagain,\nbegging for Franklin\u2019s division, complaining that he had no\nsu\ufb00icient transportation, and stating that the order forming\nnew departments deprived him of the power of ordering up\nwagons and troops, absolutely necessary for his advance on\n Richmond. Lincoln, like the whole country, was convinced that\nthere was no such force behind those works as the fears of\nthe General had counted there; and it is now humiliating to\nlearn from the o\ufb00icial report of the rebel commander\nMagruder, that, \u201cwith \ufb01ve thousand men, exclusive of the\ngarrisons, we (they) stopped and held in check over one\nhundred thousand of the enemy. With a\nhundred thousand men at his back, General McClellan went\nto work with shovels to begin a regular siege.\n\u201cAfter you left, I ascertained that less than twenty\nthousand unorganized men, without a single \ufb01eld battery,\nwere all you designed to be left for the defence of\nWashington and Manassas Junction; and part of this even\nwas to go to General Hooker\u2019s old position.\nThe President yielded to McClellan, and sent General\nFranklin to him, with his division; and General McClellan\nthanked him for his kindness and consideration, adding, \u201cI\nnow understand the matter which I did not before. General McClellan was leaving\nnothing undone to enable him to attack without delay; after\nreceiving reinforcements, he was \u201ccon\ufb01dent of results;\u201d he\nwas soon to be \u201cat them;\u201d there was to be \u201cnot a moment\u2019s\nunnecessary delay;\u201d he was \u201cgetting up the heavy guns,\nmortars and ammunition quite rapidly;\u201d there were heavy\nrains, and horrid roads, but he was \u201cmaking progress all\nthe time. General McClellan\nthought the success brilliant, if we may judge by his\ndispatches. Here was fought the\nbattle of Williamsburgh, which McClellan designated in his\n\ufb01nal report as \u201cone of the most brilliant engagements of\nthe war. All did their duty; and\nwhen, between four and \ufb01ve o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nGeneral McClellan arrived upon the ground (the battle\nhaving commenced early in the morning,) he did his duty,\nand helped materially toward a favorable result of the\naction.\nGeneral McClellan did not like the organization of the\narmy into corps. The three corps-commanders, Sumner,\nHeintzelman and Keyes, were all on the ground; and were\nregarded by the commanding General as indiscreet in\ncommencing the attack, and incompetent in its conduct. Lincoln, Mr. Chase\nwere all on a visit to Fortress Monroe; and, on the ninth of\nMay, General McClellan took occasion to write to the\nSecretary of War, asking permission to re-organize the\narmy corps. Lincoln wrote privately, and wrote\n a very frank and honest letter, dated at Fortress Monroe, of\nwhich these were the essential paragraphs:\n\u201cI have just assisted the Secretary of War in forming the\npart of a dispatch to you, relating to army corps, which\ndispatch, of course, will have reached you long before this\nwill.\nThe commanders of these corps are of course the three\nhighest o\ufb00icers with you, but I am constantly told that you\nhave no consultation or communication with them, that you\nconsult and communicate with nobody but Fitz John Porter,\nand perhaps General Franklin.\n After the receipt of this private letter, General McClellan\nconcluded not to make the change which seemed so\nessential; but he created two new corps, or \u201cprovisional\ncorps,\u201d which he placed respectively under the command of\nFitz John Porter and General Franklin, the men whom Mr.\u201d\nIn a subsequent conversation with Major General Gar\ufb01eld,\nhe said: \u201cBy the way, Gar\ufb01eld, do you know that Chase,\nStanton, General Wool and I had a campaign of our own. Lincoln said: \u201cThe Admiral\ntook the hint; and, taking Chase and Wool along, with a\ncompany or two of marines, he went on a voyage of\ndiscovery, and Stanton and I remained at Fortress Monroe.\nGeneral McClellan was still busy with his dispatches.\u201d General McClellan\nseemed to have no idea that the capital was in danger, and\nreplied to this that he wished McDowell to join him by\n water.\nLincoln was obliged, in order to save the capital, to\nsuspend McDowell\u2019s movement toward McClellan; for the\nrebel General Jackson had begun a desperate push for\nHarper\u2019s Ferry. Against this action of the President,\nMcClellan protested; and, on the twenty-\ufb01fth, the former\nwrote him a note, giving a full statement of the situation:\n\u201cYour dispatch received.\u201d\nA few hours after this dispatch was sent, the President\nsent another, stating that the enemy was driving General\nBanks before him, and was threatening Leesburgh and\nGeary on the Manassas Gap Railroad; that the movement\n looked like a general and concerted one \u2014 such an one as\nhe would not make if he were acting on the purpose of a\nvery desperate defense of Richmond; and that, if McClellan\ndid not at once attack that capital, he would probably have\nto give up the job, and come to the defense of Washington.\nThis dispatch moved the General. General\nMcClellan described it as a perfect rout of the enemy, at\nwhich \nthe \nPresident \nwrote \na \ndispatch, \nstating \nhis\ngrati\ufb01cation, but expressing his surprise that the Richmond\nand Fredericksburg Railroad was not seized again. Lincoln informed General McClellan that\nBanks was safe at Williamsport. After the engagement, General McClellan crossed\nthe river, but found the roads so bad that artillery could not\nbe handled, and that pursuit was impossible; although the\nrebels had found it convenient to get back, and expected to\nbe pursued. Informed of this, General\nMcClellan ordered the force to fall back to its old position:\nand on the same day wrote to Washington that he only\nwaited for the river to fall, to cross over the rest of his\narmy, and make a general attack; and that the morale of his\narmy was such that be could venture much, not fearing the\nodds against him.\nMcClellan had met great losses by battle and disease;\nand the government did what it could for him, by placing\nunder his command the troops at Fortress Monroe, and by\nsending to him McCall\u2019s division of McDowell\u2019s corps. The particular friends of McClellan were busy at this\ntime with suspicions and reports that the President and\nSecretary of War were trying to sacri\ufb01ce him; and, to put\nan extinguisher on this, Mr.\u201d\nWith a long series of dispatches in which General\nMcClellan quarrels with the relations which General\nMcDowell\u2019s troops held to his command, it is not necessary\nto burden these pages. The President wished to hold on to\nMcDowell\u2019s troops, and still have them assist McClellan.\nMcClellan saw in this arrangement only ambition on the\npart of McDowell; and, in one of his dispatches, wrote the\ngovernment: \u201cIf I cannot fully control all his troops, I want\nnone of them, but would prefer to \ufb01ght the battle with what\nI have, and let others be responsible for the results,\u201d which\nwas equivalent to saying that he would rather be whipped\nwithout McDowell\u2019s troops, under the circumstances, than\nbe victorious with them.\u201d At this very moment as it appears by\nMcClellan\u2019s report, he had ordered supplies to a point on\nthe James River, to which he expected to retreat. \u201cIf I save this army\nnow,\u201d said he to the Secretary of War, \u201cI tell you plainly that\nI owe no thanks to you, or to any persons in Washington;\nyou have done your best to sacri\ufb01ce this army. The President wrote him: \u201cSave your army at all\nevents.\u201d\nGeneral McClellan called upon the President for a\nreinforcement of \ufb01fty thousand troops, to which Mr. It was absolutely impossible for the\ngovernment to send reinforcements at once, to enable\nMcClellan to assume the o\ufb00ensive. \u201cA declaration of radical views, especially\nupon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present armies,\u201d\nsaid the General: but he did not seem to produce a\nprofound impression upon the mind of the Executive.\nThe President determined to ascertain, by personal\ninspection, the condition of the army; and, on the eighth,\nvisited General McClellan at Harrison\u2019s Landing. Lincoln, and of the corps commanders, that the army\nshould repair to Washington, but General McClellan was\nagainst it. He wanted the whole of General\nBurnside\u2019s command in North Carolina to help him.\nGeneral McClellan replied that 38,250 men were absent by\n authority. Why did the General let them go.\nIt was determined at last to withdraw the army from the\nPeninsula, and the order found McClellan still protesting.\nHe received the order to remove his sick on the second of\nAugust; but it was not until the twenty-third that General\nFranklin\u2019s corps started from Fortress Monroe, and not\nuntil the twenty-sixth that McClellan himself arrived at\nAlexandria. That portion of the army of the Potomac\nwhich arrived before McClellan, pushed o\ufb00 at once to\nreinforce Pope; but not a man that came afterwards took\nany part in those battles by which that General was driven\nback upon Washington. Under the representation that the army\nof the Potomac would serve under no commander but\nMcClellan, General Pope was relieved, and the former\nplaced in command of all the troops. General McClellan did not\npursue, owing to the condition of his army, one whole corps\nof which (Fitz John Porter\u2019s) had not been in the action at\nall; and, as if the habit of calling for reinforcements had\nbecome chronic, renewed his application for more troops. Then\nGeneral McClellan began to make inquiries, and call for\nshoes and other supplies; but he did not begin to move. A\nfew days afterward, the rebel General Stuart made a raid\ninto Pennsylvania, with a large cavalry force, keeping\nGeneral McClellan busy, and calling forth from him the\ncon\ufb01dent statement that the daring raiders would be\nbagged; but they went completely around the army, and\nescaped in safety. A note written to the General by Mr.\n\u201cAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that\nyou can not subsist your army at Winchester, unless the\nrailroad from Harper\u2019s Ferry to that point be put in working\norder. In the light of these operations, the\ncampaign of McClellan looks like the work of a boy or the\nplay of a man.\n With General McClellan\u2019s motives, the writer has no\ndesire to deal. If there is one fact in McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign that stands out with peculiar prominence, it is\nthat both Mr. On one side, we see the presumptuous\nvolunteering of general political and military advice, the\nunreasonable call for reinforcements when assured again\nand again that he had every man that could be given him,\nexpostulations against government orders, quarreling with\ngovernment arrangements, absolute criminations of the\ngovernment, \nunaccountable \nhesitations \nand \nboyish\nine\ufb00iciency; while, on the other, there were almost\nunbroken respectfulness, patience and toleration, ardent\ndesire for the best results, constant urgency to action,\nconstant sacri\ufb01ce of personal feeling and opinion, and a\n patent wish to do everything practicable or possible to give\nthe commanding General everything he wanted.\nThat General McClellan loved power, is evident; and it is\njust as evident that it was not pleasant to him to share it\nwith any one; but, on the whole, there is no evidence that\nhe was not a good, well-meaning, and patriotic man. He\nwas not a great man, nor a great general.\nThis chapter should be concluded here, but space must\nbe taken for a very brief record of the immediately\nsucceeding fortunes of the army of the Potomac, and a\nhurried chronicle of the other military events of the year.\nOn the retirement of General McClellan, General Burnside\nwas placed in command of the army of the Potomac; and, at\nthe same time, the rebel army commenced falling back\nupon Richmond. A combination of all the rebel armies at\nCorinth surprised our troops at Pittsburg Landing, under\nGeneral Grant, on the morning of April sixth, with\noverwhelming numbers, and drove them back to the\nprotection of our gunboats; but on the following day,\nthrough the opportune arrival of General Buell, with his\nforces, the rebels were pushed back into retreat, with\nterrible losses, leaving our victorious army almost as badly\npunished as themselves.", "Mcclellan_Quarrels_1862": "\nA CIVILIAN, IGNORANT of the art of war, can only judge a\nmilitary man by what he accomplishes in the long run by\nhis policy and action; and it is di\ufb00icult for such a judge to\nperceive what General McClellan accomplished, With his\nmagni\ufb01cent army of a hundred and sixty thousand as good\nsoldiers as ever the sun shone upon \u2014 well drilled, well fed,\nwell clothed and well armed \u2014 but to scatter and wear out\nthat army, volunteer general advice to a government that\nwas presumed to be competent to the management of its\nown a\ufb00airs, and win the doubtful honor of becoming the\nfavorite of men who, from the \ufb01rst, opposed the war, and\nthrew all possible obstacles in the way of its successful\nprosecution.

The President wished to hold on to\nMcDowell\u2019s troops, and still have them assist McClellan.\nMcClellan saw in this arrangement only ambition on the\npart of McDowell; and, in one of his dispatches, wrote the\ngovernment: \u201cIf I cannot fully control all his troops, I want\nnone of them, but would prefer to \ufb01ght the battle with what\nI have, and let others be responsible for the results,\u201d which\nwas equivalent to saying that he would rather be whipped\nwithout McDowell\u2019s troops, under the circumstances, than\nbe victorious with them.\u201d At this very moment as it appears by\nMcClellan\u2019s report, he had ordered supplies to a point on\nthe James River, to which he expected to retreat.\u201d\nGeneral McClellan called upon the President for a\nreinforcement of \ufb01fty thousand troops, to which Mr. It was absolutely impossible for the\ngovernment to send reinforcements at once, to enable\nMcClellan to assume the o\ufb00ensive.\nThe President determined to ascertain, by personal\ninspection, the condition of the army; and, on the eighth,\nvisited General McClellan at Harrison\u2019s Landing. Lincoln, and of the corps commanders, that the army\nshould repair to Washington, but General McClellan was\nagainst it.\nGeneral McClellan replied that 38,250 men were absent by\n authority.\nIt was determined at last to withdraw the army from the\nPeninsula, and the order found McClellan still protesting.\nHe received the order to remove his sick on the second of\nAugust; but it was not until the twenty-third that General\nFranklin\u2019s corps started from Fortress Monroe, and not\nuntil the twenty-sixth that McClellan himself arrived at\nAlexandria. That portion of the army of the Potomac\nwhich arrived before McClellan, pushed o\ufb00 at once to\nreinforce Pope; but not a man that came afterwards took\nany part in those battles by which that General was driven\nback upon Washington. Under the representation that the army\nof the Potomac would serve under no commander but\nMcClellan, General Pope was relieved, and the former\nplaced in command of all the troops. General McClellan did not\npursue, owing to the condition of his army, one whole corps\nof which (Fitz John Porter\u2019s) had not been in the action at\nall; and, as if the habit of calling for reinforcements had\nbecome chronic, renewed his application for more troops. Then\nGeneral McClellan began to make inquiries, and call for\nshoes and other supplies; but he did not begin to move. A\nfew days afterward, the rebel General Stuart made a raid\ninto Pennsylvania, with a large cavalry force, keeping\nGeneral McClellan busy, and calling forth from him the\ncon\ufb01dent statement that the daring raiders would be\nbagged; but they went completely around the army, and\nescaped in safety.\n\u201cAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that\nyou can not subsist your army at Winchester, unless the\nrailroad from Harper\u2019s Ferry to that point be put in working\norder. In the light of these operations, the\ncampaign of McClellan looks like the work of a boy or the\nplay of a man.\n With General McClellan\u2019s motives, the writer has no\ndesire to deal. If there is one fact in McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign that stands out with peculiar prominence, it is\nthat both Mr.\nThat General McClellan loved power, is evident; and it is\njust as evident that it was not pleasant to him to share it\nwith any one; but, on the whole, there is no evidence that\nhe was not a good, well-meaning, and patriotic man.\nThis chapter should be concluded here, but space must\nbe taken for a very brief record of the immediately\nsucceeding fortunes of the army of the Potomac, and a\nhurried chronicle of the other military events of the year.\nOn the retirement of General McClellan, General Burnside\nwas placed in command of the army of the Potomac; and, at\nthe same time, the rebel army commenced falling back\nupon Richmond. At the very last of the year, there was a severe\n\ufb01ght at Murfreesboro which resulted favorably to our arms;\nand the new year of 1863 found a great advance made\ntoward the entire redemption of Kentucky, Tennessee and\nMissouri, from the presence of rebel armies and the\nprevalence of rebel in\ufb02uence.", "Mcclellan_1862": "\nA CIVILIAN, IGNORANT of the art of war, can only judge a\nmilitary man by what he accomplishes in the long run by\nhis policy and action; and it is di\ufb00icult for such a judge to\nperceive what General McClellan accomplished, With his\nmagni\ufb01cent army of a hundred and sixty thousand as good\nsoldiers as ever the sun shone upon \u2014 well drilled, well fed,\nwell clothed and well armed \u2014 but to scatter and wear out\nthat army, volunteer general advice to a government that\nwas presumed to be competent to the management of its\nown a\ufb00airs, and win the doubtful honor of becoming the\nfavorite of men who, from the \ufb01rst, opposed the war, and\nthrew all possible obstacles in the way of its successful\nprosecution. The whole history of McClellan\u2019s operations is\na history of magni\ufb01cent preparations and promises, of fatal\nhesitations and procrastinations, of clamoring for more\npreparations, \nand \njusti\ufb01cations \nof \nhesitations \nand\nprocrastinations, \nof \ngovernment \nindulgence \nand\nforbearance, of military intrigues within the camp, of\npopular impatience and alarms, and of the waste of great\nmeans and golden opportunities. Even the opportunity of\nbecoming \u201cthe hero of Antietam\u201d came to General\nMcClellan through his culpable remissness in permitting\nthe enemy to cross the Potomac; and this victory lost all its\nvalue by his failure to gather its fruits.\n When General McClellan assumed command, he found\nwaiting for him \ufb01fty thousand men, more or less, in and\naround Washington. They tried\nto induce McClellan to aid in this business; and, at one time\nin October, he agreed to send four thousand men to co-\noperate with a naval force for this purpose; but he falsi\ufb01ed\nhis promise, on the ground that his engineers told him that\nso large a force could not be landed.\nThe con\ufb01dence in General McClellan on the part of the\ngovernment and the country generally was at this time\nunbounded; and he could not appear among his soldiers\nwithout such demonstrations of enthusiastic a\ufb00ection as\nfew commanders have ever received. On the \ufb01rst of\nNovember he succeeded General Scott in the command of\nall the armies of the Union, still retaining personal\ncommand of the Army of the Potomac; but he seemed to be\nunable to move.\nTo this last order of the President, General McClellan\nreplied in a long letter to the Secretary of War.\u201d\nGeneral McClellan replied to this through the Secretary\nof War, after his fashion; but the President was not\n convinced, and \ufb01nally agreed to submit the two plans to a\ncouncil of twelve o\ufb00icers.\nOn the eighth of March, the President ordered General\nMcClellan to organize that part of his army which he\nproposed to engage in active operations, into four Army\nCorps, \nto \nbe \ncommanded \nrespectively \nby \nGeneral\nMcDowell, General Sumner, General Heintzelman and\nGeneral Keyes; and directed the order to be executed with\nsuch \ndispatch \nas \nnot \nto \ndelay \noperations \nalready\ndetermined on \u2014 alluding to the movement by the\nChesapeake and Rappahannock.\nOn the next day, as has already been stated, the enemy\nretired unsuspected and undisturbed from his defenses;\nand then General McClellan moved forward, not to pursue,\naccording to his own authority, but to give his troops some\nexercise, and a taste of the march and bivouac, before more\n active operations.\nOn the eleventh of March, General McClellan was\nrelieved from the command of other military departments,\nbecause he had personally taken the \ufb01eld. Stanton wrote to General McClellan, stating\nthat the President saw no objection to the plan, but\ndirecting that such a force should be left at Manassas\nJunction as would make it entirely certain that the enemy\nshould not repossess it, that Washington should be left\nsecure, and that, whatever place might be chosen as the\nnew base, the army should move at once in pursuit of the\nenemy, by some route. Lincoln ordered\nBlenker\u2019s division from the army of the Potomac to join\nGeneral Fremont, who had importuned him for a larger\nforce, and who was supported in his request by exacting\nfriends. In a note to General McClellan, he said,\u2014 \u201cI write\nthis to assure you that I did so with great pain,\nunderstanding that you would wish it otherwise.\nTransportation had already been provided by the War\nDepartment for moving the troops to any new base that\nmight be determined on, and General McClellan was not\nobliged to wait. In\nall the orders given by the President concerning the\nmovements of this army, there was one condition that he\ninsisted upon, viz, that troops should be left su\ufb00icient to\nprotect Washington; and by General McClellan\u2019s order only\ntwenty thousand e\ufb00ective men were to be left with General\nWadsworth, the military governor of the District. The force\nwas much smaller than was necessary, according to\nGeneral McClellan\u2019s previous calculations; and General\nWadsworth was so much impressed with its inadequacy\nthat he called the attention of the war department to the\n subject. Hitchcock, whose decision was\nembodied in the words: \u201cIn view of the opinion expressed\nby the council of the commanders of army corps, of the\nforce necessary for the capital, though not numerically\nstated, and of the force represented by General McClellan\nas left for that purpose, we are of opinion that the\nrequirement of the President that this city shall be left\nentirely secure, not only in the opinion of the General-in-\nChief, but that of the commanders of all the army corps\nalso, has not been fully complied with.\u201d In the meantime,\nGeneral McClellan had gone forward to Fortress Monroe,\nand all but two corps of the troops had left for the new\nbase.\nGeneral McClellan pushed a portion of his troops toward\nYorktown at once \u2014 toward a line of intrenchments held by\n the enemy, stretching across the Peninsula. No one\ndoubts now that General McClellan\u2019s cautiousness betrayed\nhis judgment, and that a strong and well-directed attack\nwould have swept the rebels out or their works.\nStanton\u2019s \ndispatch, \nGeneral \nMcClellan \nwrote \nagain,\nbegging for Franklin\u2019s division, complaining that he had no\nsu\ufb00icient transportation, and stating that the order forming\nnew departments deprived him of the power of ordering up\nwagons and troops, absolutely necessary for his advance on\n Richmond. With a\nhundred thousand men at his back, General McClellan went\nto work with shovels to begin a regular siege. LINCOLN.\nThe President yielded to McClellan, and sent General\nFranklin to him, with his division; and General McClellan\nthanked him for his kindness and consideration, adding, \u201cI\nnow understand the matter which I did not before. General McClellan was leaving\nnothing undone to enable him to attack without delay; after\nreceiving reinforcements, he was \u201ccon\ufb01dent of results;\u201d he\nwas soon to be \u201cat them;\u201d there was to be \u201cnot a moment\u2019s\nunnecessary delay;\u201d he was \u201cgetting up the heavy guns,\nmortars and ammunition quite rapidly;\u201d there were heavy\nrains, and horrid roads, but he was \u201cmaking progress all\nthe time. General McClellan\nthought the success brilliant, if we may judge by his\ndispatches. Here was fought the\nbattle of Williamsburgh, which McClellan designated in his\n\ufb01nal report as \u201cone of the most brilliant engagements of\nthe war. All did their duty; and\nwhen, between four and \ufb01ve o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nGeneral McClellan arrived upon the ground (the battle\nhaving commenced early in the morning,) he did his duty,\nand helped materially toward a favorable result of the\naction.\nGeneral McClellan did not like the organization of the\narmy into corps. Lincoln, Mr. Chase\nwere all on a visit to Fortress Monroe; and, on the ninth of\nMay, General McClellan took occasion to write to the\nSecretary of War, asking permission to re-organize the\narmy corps.\n After the receipt of this private letter, General McClellan\nconcluded not to make the change which seemed so\nessential; but he created two new corps, or \u201cprovisional\ncorps,\u201d which he placed respectively under the command of\nFitz John Porter and General Franklin, the men whom Mr.\nGeneral McClellan was still busy with his dispatches.\u201d General McClellan\nseemed to have no idea that the capital was in danger, and\nreplied to this that he wished McDowell to join him by\n water.\nLincoln was obliged, in order to save the capital, to\nsuspend McDowell\u2019s movement toward McClellan; for the\nrebel General Jackson had begun a desperate push for\nHarper\u2019s Ferry. Against this action of the President,\nMcClellan protested; and, on the twenty-\ufb01fth, the former\nwrote him a note, giving a full statement of the situation:\n\u201cYour dispatch received.\u201d\nA few hours after this dispatch was sent, the President\nsent another, stating that the enemy was driving General\nBanks before him, and was threatening Leesburgh and\nGeary on the Manassas Gap Railroad; that the movement\n looked like a general and concerted one \u2014 such an one as\nhe would not make if he were acting on the purpose of a\nvery desperate defense of Richmond; and that, if McClellan\ndid not at once attack that capital, he would probably have\nto give up the job, and come to the defense of Washington. General\nMcClellan described it as a perfect rout of the enemy, at\nwhich \nthe \nPresident \nwrote \na \ndispatch, \nstating \nhis\ngrati\ufb01cation, but expressing his surprise that the Richmond\nand Fredericksburg Railroad was not seized again. Lincoln informed General McClellan that\nBanks was safe at Williamsport. After the engagement, General McClellan crossed\nthe river, but found the roads so bad that artillery could not\nbe handled, and that pursuit was impossible; although the\nrebels had found it convenient to get back, and expected to\nbe pursued. Informed of this, General\nMcClellan ordered the force to fall back to its old position:\nand on the same day wrote to Washington that he only\nwaited for the river to fall, to cross over the rest of his\narmy, and make a general attack; and that the morale of his\narmy was such that be could venture much, not fearing the\nodds against him.\nMcClellan had met great losses by battle and disease;\nand the government did what it could for him, by placing\nunder his command the troops at Fortress Monroe, and by\nsending to him McCall\u2019s division of McDowell\u2019s corps.

He had himself prepared a proclamation,\nwhich embodied his views, and had submitted it to Mr.\nLincoln.\nOn the twenty-fourth of September, two days after the\nissue of the preliminary proclamation, Mr. Lincoln gave\nutterance to a proclamation suspending the writ of habeas\ncorpus.\nTHE EVENTS OF 1863, legislative, military, and personal as\nthey relate to Mr. In August, 1862,\nhe called to the Executive Mansion a representative\ncompany of negroes whom he familiarly addressed on the\nsubject, freely telling them of the disadvantages under\nwhich they labored, expressing his convictions that they\nsu\ufb00ered much by living in association with the whites, and\nuttering his conviction that the whites su\ufb00ered by living\nwith them, even when they were free.\nIn his message delivered to Congress on the opening of\nthe session of 1862-63, he called up the subject again; and\ncommunicated information of the measures he had taken,\nfor e\ufb00ecting his wishes, and securing to the blacks the\n bene\ufb01ts of the congressional provision.\u201d\nSudden emancipation was never in accordance with Mr. Either through the failure of McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign, or the e\ufb00ect of the emancipation proclamation,\nor the in\ufb02uence of both together, the administration had\nreceived a rebuke through the autumn elections of 1862. His e\ufb00orts for\nmeasures of compensated emancipation failed.\nOn the twenty-second of November, 1862, two months\nafter Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation suspending the\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the opponents of the\ngovernment became so quiet that an order was issued from\nthe War Department, discharging from further military\nrestraint all those persons who had been arrested for\ndiscouraging volunteer enlistments, opposing the draft, or\notherwise giving aid and comfort to the enemy, in all states\nwhere the draft had been e\ufb00ected, or the quota of\nvolunteers and militia had been furnished.\nLincoln, by proclamation on the \ufb01fteenth day of September,\nsuspended the writ throughout the United States. Lincoln and his administration had\nentirely recovered from whatever depressing in\ufb02uence the\nemancipation policy had occasioned, and from the e\ufb00ects of\nthe Peninsular campaign. In this letter he treated\nagain of the subject of emancipation; and handled the\nclamorer for peace, the enemies of the Emancipation\nProclamation, and the advocates of compromise, with most\nadmirable skill. I issued the\nProclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union.\nWhenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the\nUnion, if I shall urge you to continue \ufb01ghting, it will be an\napt time then for you to declare you win not \ufb01ght to free\nnegroes.

Lincoln.\n Then \ncame \ndiscussions \nand \naction \nconcerning\nemancipation, the parties dividing on the issue of gradual\nor immediate emancipation; and this was followed, or\naccompanied, by disagreement between the commander of\nthe federal forces and Governor Gamble, controlling the\nstate \ntroops, \nraised \noriginally \nas \nauxiliary \nto \nthe\ngovernment. Lincoln, in a note written at this time,\nsaid: \u201cIt is very painful to me that you, in Missouri, cannot\nor will not settle your factional quarrel among yourselves. \nGradual\nemancipationists were denounced as traitors by the radical\nemancipation party, which claimed to represent the only\nloyal elements of the state; and, of course, gradual\nemancipationists retorted the charge, and assumed the\nclaim.", "Emancipation_Proclamation_1863": "\nON THE 9TH of December, 1863, Mr. Eleven months had passed\nsince the \ufb01nal proclamation of emancipation was issued;\nand Mr. The rebel borders had been\npressed still further back; the rebel territory had been\ndivided by the opening of the Mississippi; Tennessee and\nArkansas had been substantially cleared of insurgent\ncontrol; and, in these states, in\ufb02uential citizens were\ndeclaring openly for emancipation. No servile\ninsurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, had marked\nthe measures of emancipation and the arming of the blacks. On the day previous to the delivery\nof the message, he had issued a proclamation of amnesty,\nto all those engaged in the rebellion who should take an\noath to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States, and the Union of the states under it, with the\nacts of Congress passed during the rebellion, and the\nproclamations of the President concerning slaves. This\nproclamation made certain exceptions of persons in the\ncivil and military service of the rebel government, and of\npersons who had left the civil and military service of the\nUnited States to aid in the rebellion. These were the principal\nprovisions of the proclamation; and to them the President\ncalled congressional attention. But, if it be\nproper to require, as a test of admission to the political\nbody, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United\nStates and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and\nproclamations in regard to slavery. Those laws and\n proclamations were enacted, and put forth, for the purpose\nof aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. I may add, at this point, that while I remain in my\npresent position, I shall not attempt to retract, or modify,\nthe Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that\nproclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.\u201d\nThis proclamation was issued as a rallying point for those\nloyal or penitent elements which were believed to exist in\nmany of the insurgent states, and which, in the confusion of\nplans for reconstruction, were lying dormant, and without\npractical advantage to the states themselves and to the\ngovernment. On the 24th of\nMarch, 1864, he issued a supplementary and explanatory\nproclamation, de\ufb01ning more carefully the cases in which\nrebels were to be pardoned, and the manner in which they\nwere to avail themselves of the bene\ufb01ts of the amnesty. A bill for the establishment of a Bureau of\nFreedmen\u2019s A\ufb00airs passed the House, but failed in the\nSenate; while a resolution to submit to a vote of the states\nan amendment of the Constitution, permanently prohibiting\nthe existence of slavery in the states and territories of the\nUnion, was passed by the Senate, but rejected by the\nHouse. The fugitive slave law \u2014 one of those compromise\nmeasures which were to silence the anti-slavery agitation\nforever, and be a \ufb01nal settlement of the slavery question \u2014\nwas repealed, with surprising ease and unanimity. As early as\nJuly 30th, 1863, he issued an order declaring that: \u201cThe\ngovernment of the United States will give the same\nprotection to all its soldiers; and, if the enemy shall sell or\nenslave anyone, because of his color, the o\ufb00ense shall be\n punished by retaliation upon the enemy\u2019s prisoners in our\npossession.\u201d Proceeding, he de\ufb01nitely ordered, \u201cthat for\nevery soldier of the United States killed in violation of the\nlaws of war, a rebel soldier should (shall) be executed; and\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy, or sold into slavery, a\nrebel soldier should (shall) be placed at hard labor on the\npublic works, and continued at such labor until the other\nshould (shall) be released, or receive such treatment as was\n(is, or may be) due to a prisoner of war.

He had himself prepared a proclamation,\nwhich embodied his views, and had submitted it to Mr.\nOn the twenty-fourth of September, two days after the\nissue of the preliminary proclamation, Mr. Lincoln gave\nutterance to a proclamation suspending the writ of habeas\ncorpus.\nAt the succeeding session of Congress, these complaints\nhad immediate expression; and the proclamation was\nfuriously attacked at once.\nTHE EVENTS OF 1863, legislative, military, and personal as\nthey relate to Mr. In August, 1862,\nhe called to the Executive Mansion a representative\ncompany of negroes whom he familiarly addressed on the\nsubject, freely telling them of the disadvantages under\nwhich they labored, expressing his convictions that they\nsu\ufb00ered much by living in association with the whites, and\nuttering his conviction that the whites su\ufb00ered by living\nwith them, even when they were free.\nIn his message delivered to Congress on the opening of\nthe session of 1862-63, he called up the subject again; and\ncommunicated information of the measures he had taken,\nfor e\ufb00ecting his wishes, and securing to the blacks the\n bene\ufb01ts of the congressional provision. Nothing but the necessities of war\nwould have induced him to decree it with relation to the\nslaves of any state.\nThe same antagonisms were exhibited concerning a\nmeasure for enrolling and drafting the militia of the\ndi\ufb00erent states, so that each state should be compelled to\ncontribute its equitable quota, the troops when raised to be\nunder the control of the President. Either through the failure of McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign, or the e\ufb00ect of the emancipation proclamation,\nor the in\ufb02uence of both together, the administration had\nreceived a rebuke through the autumn elections of 1862.\nOn the twenty-second of November, 1862, two months\nafter Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation suspending the\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the opponents of the\ngovernment became so quiet that an order was issued from\nthe War Department, discharging from further military\nrestraint all those persons who had been arrested for\ndiscouraging volunteer enlistments, opposing the draft, or\notherwise giving aid and comfort to the enemy, in all states\nwhere the draft had been e\ufb00ected, or the quota of\nvolunteers and militia had been furnished.\nLincoln, by proclamation on the \ufb01fteenth day of September,\nsuspended the writ throughout the United States. Lincoln and his administration had\nentirely recovered from whatever depressing in\ufb02uence the\nemancipation policy had occasioned, and from the e\ufb00ects of\nthe Peninsular campaign. In this letter he treated\nagain of the subject of emancipation; and handled the\nclamorer for peace, the enemies of the Emancipation\nProclamation, and the advocates of compromise, with most\nadmirable skill. I issued the\nProclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union.\nWhenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the\nUnion, if I shall urge you to continue \ufb01ghting, it will be an\napt time then for you to declare you win not \ufb01ght to free\nnegroes. The\n President issued a proclamation calling for one hundred\nthousand militia to assist in driving back the foe.\nOn the \ufb01fteenth of July, he issued a proclamation, setting\napart the sixth day of August to be observed as a day for\nnational thanksgiving, praise and prayer: inviting the\npeople to \u201crender the homage due to the Divine Majesty,\nfor the wonderful things he has done in the nation\u2019s behalf:\nand invoke the in\ufb02uences of his Holy Spirit to subdue the\n anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless\nand cruel rebellion; to change the hearts of the insurgents;\nto guide the counsels of the government with wisdom\nadequate to so great a national emergency; and to visit\nwith tender care and consolation, throughout the length\nand breadth of our land, all those who, through the\nvicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles and sieges, have\nbeen brought to su\ufb00er in mind, body, or estate; and, \ufb01nally,\nto lead the whole nation through paths of repentance and\nsubmission to the Divine Will, back to the perfect\nenjoyment of union and fraternal peace.\u201d On the third of\nOctober he issued another proclamation of thanksgiving,\nsetting apart the last Thursday of November as the day to\nbe observed.", "Proclamation_1863": "\nON THE 9TH of December, 1863, Mr. Eleven months had passed\nsince the \ufb01nal proclamation of emancipation was issued;\nand Mr. On the day previous to the delivery\nof the message, he had issued a proclamation of amnesty,\nto all those engaged in the rebellion who should take an\noath to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States, and the Union of the states under it, with the\nacts of Congress passed during the rebellion, and the\nproclamations of the President concerning slaves. This\nproclamation made certain exceptions of persons in the\ncivil and military service of the rebel government, and of\npersons who had left the civil and military service of the\nUnited States to aid in the rebellion. These were the principal\nprovisions of the proclamation; and to them the President\ncalled congressional attention. But, if it be\nproper to require, as a test of admission to the political\nbody, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United\nStates and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and\nproclamations in regard to slavery. Those laws and\n proclamations were enacted, and put forth, for the purpose\nof aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. I may add, at this point, that while I remain in my\npresent position, I shall not attempt to retract, or modify,\nthe Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that\nproclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.\u201d\nThis proclamation was issued as a rallying point for those\nloyal or penitent elements which were believed to exist in\nmany of the insurgent states, and which, in the confusion of\nplans for reconstruction, were lying dormant, and without\npractical advantage to the states themselves and to the\ngovernment. On the 24th of\nMarch, 1864, he issued a supplementary and explanatory\nproclamation, de\ufb01ning more carefully the cases in which\nrebels were to be pardoned, and the manner in which they\nwere to avail themselves of the bene\ufb01ts of the amnesty. A bill for the establishment of a Bureau of\nFreedmen\u2019s A\ufb00airs passed the House, but failed in the\nSenate; while a resolution to submit to a vote of the states\nan amendment of the Constitution, permanently prohibiting\nthe existence of slavery in the states and territories of the\nUnion, was passed by the Senate, but rejected by the\nHouse. The fugitive slave law \u2014 one of those compromise\nmeasures which were to silence the anti-slavery agitation\nforever, and be a \ufb01nal settlement of the slavery question \u2014\nwas repealed, with surprising ease and unanimity. Lincoln\ntook occasion to say: \u201cThe expression of the nation\u2019s\napprobation of what you have already done, and its reliance\non you for what remains to do, in the existing struggle, is\nnow presented with this commission, constituting you\n Lieutenant-general of the armies of the United States. Lincoln made a brief speech. As early as\nJuly 30th, 1863, he issued an order declaring that: \u201cThe\ngovernment of the United States will give the same\nprotection to all its soldiers; and, if the enemy shall sell or\nenslave anyone, because of his color, the o\ufb00ense shall be\n punished by retaliation upon the enemy\u2019s prisoners in our\npossession.\u201d Proceeding, he de\ufb01nitely ordered, \u201cthat for\nevery soldier of the United States killed in violation of the\nlaws of war, a rebel soldier should (shall) be executed; and\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy, or sold into slavery, a\nrebel soldier should (shall) be placed at hard labor on the\npublic works, and continued at such labor until the other\nshould (shall) be released, or receive such treatment as was\n(is, or may be) due to a prisoner of war.

When, still later, General Hunter\nattempted military emancipation, I again forbade it,\nbecause I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had\ncome. When, in March and May and July, 1862, I made\nearnest and successive appeals to the border states to favor\ncompensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable\nnecessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks\nwould come, unless averted by that measure.\nWe have thus the political and military reasons for\nproclaiming emancipation in Mr.\u201d\nOn \nMonday, \nthe \n22d \nof \nSeptember, \n1862, \nthe\nproclamation was issued.\n\u201cThat attention is hereby called to an act of Congress\nentitled \u2018An Act to make an additional Article of War,\u2019\napproved March 13th, 1862, and which act is in the words\nand \ufb01gures following:\n\u201c\u2018 Be \nit \nenacted \nby \nthe \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof\nRepresentatives of the United States of America in\nCongress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be\npromulgated as an additional article of war for the\n government of the army of the United States, and shall be\nobeyed and observed as such:\n\u201c\u2018Article \u2014 All o\ufb00icers or persons in the military or naval\nservice of the United States are prohibited from employing\nany of the forces under their respective commands for the\npurpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who\nmay have escaped from any persons to whom such service\nor labor is claimed to be due; and any o\ufb00icer who shall be\nfound guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall\nbe dismissed from the service.\u2019\n\u201cAlso, to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled\n\u2018An Act to suppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and\nRebellion, to seize and con\ufb01scate Property of Rebels, and\nfor other purposes,\u2019 approved July 16th, 1862, and which\nsections are in the words and \ufb01gures following:\n\u201c\u2018Sec.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons\nengaged in the military and naval service of the United\nStates to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective\nspheres of service, the act and sections above recited.
