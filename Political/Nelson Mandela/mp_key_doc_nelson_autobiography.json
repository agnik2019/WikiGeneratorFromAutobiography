We demanded that all political prisoners be in one category. But the prison authorities wielded the classification\nsystem as a weapon against political prisoners, threatening to lower our hard-won classifications in order to control our behavior.\u201d\nEvery six months, prisoners were called before the prison board to have their classifications evaluated. The board was meant to assess our\nbehavior in terms of prison regulations, but we found that it preferred to act as a political tribunal rather than a mere evaluator of behavior. Shortly afterward, we agreed among ourselves not to discuss politics with the prison board. I found this one of the most\ninhumane restrictions of the prison system. Visits were a maximum of thirty minutes long, and\npolitical prisoners were not permitted contact visits, in which the visitor and prisoner were in the same room.

The campaign to improve conditions in prison was part of the apartheid struggle.\n\nShortly after we started working at the quarry, we were joined in Section B by a number of other prominent political prisoners.
