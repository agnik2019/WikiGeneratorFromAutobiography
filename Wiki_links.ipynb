      "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[2] GAHN-dee; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi;[3] mahatma is an honorific meaning \"great-soul\" or \"venerable\" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for \"father\", \"papa\"). \n",

      "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, India.[5]  Several members of his family worked for the government of the state.  When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to study law in England.[6]  After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with  dark  skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. In 1897, Gandhi was attacked by a group of people in Durban Harbor, South Africa when he was going to work. He went to South Africa because he could not find work in India.[7] When traveling through South Africa, Gandhi was also kicked out of a first class train because of his skin color. Then Gandhi started protesting against segregation.[8] He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws.  He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the British Empire, but wanted independence.  He was a huge leader during that era and his thoughts helped catalyze the Indian independence movement.\n",

      "People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought the country should break into separate countries so different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country.\n",
