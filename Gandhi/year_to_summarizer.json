{"1857": "It was easy to be called, but it was difficult to practise at the bar. I have  already said that, when I went to England, I possessed a note of  introduction to Dadabhai. I  thought I had no right to trouble such a great man for an interview. In order to come in close touch with the students  he had founded an association. He should be able to read a man's character from  his face. And every Indian ought to know Indian history. Get hold of that at once and also  read two more books to understand human nature.' I was extremely grateful to this venerable friend. The next day I purchased  Lavator's book. And as I had a fair share of these last I felt somewhat  reassured. I could not read Kaye's and Malleson's volumes in England, but I did so in  South Africa, as I had made a point of reading them at the first  opportunity.", "1869": "The Gandhis belong to the Bania caste and seem to have been originally grocers. Uttamchand Gandhi, alias Ota Gandhi, my grandfather, must have been a man of principle. He had four sons by his first wife and two by his second wife. He was a pensioner of the Rajkot State when he died. The Agent was angry and asked Kaba Gandhi to apologize. This he refused to do and was therefore kept under detention for a few hours. My father never had any ambition to accumulate riches and left us very little property. He had no education, save that of experience. At best, he might be said to have read up to the fifth Gujarati standard. Of history and geography he was innocent. I can recall her once falling ill when she was observing the Chandrayana2 vow, but the illness was not allowed to interrupt the observance. Not content with that she fasted every alternate day during one Chaturmas. Everyone knows that at the height of the rainy season the sun often does not condescend to show his face. That does not matter,\" she would say cheerfully, \"God did not want me to eat today.\" There I was put into a primary school, and I can well recollect those days, including the names and other particulars of the teachers who taught me. I could have been only a mediocre student. From this school I went to the suburban school and thence to the high school, having already reached my twelfth year. He had set us five words to write as a spelling exercise. The teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my neighbour's slate, for I had thought that the teacher was there to supervise us against copying. Yet the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my teacher. I was by nature blind to the faults of elders. Therefore I would do the lessons, but often without my mind in them. Here is an example for you to copy,' I said to myself. There was a similar incident connected with another play. This play-Harishchandra -captured my heart. was the question I asked myself day and night. As I see the youngsters of the same age about me who are under my care, and think of my own marriage, I am inclined to pity myself and to congratulate them on having escaped my lot. I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage. In doing so there was no thought of our welfare, much less our wishes. It was purely a question of their own convenience and economy. They waste their substance, they waste their time. It would be better, thought my elders, to have all this bother over at one and the same time. It is likely that they wanted to have the last best time of their lives. So my brother and I were both taken to Porbandar from Rajkot. My father was a Diwan, but nevertheless a servant, and all the more so because he was in favour with the Thakore Saheb. And when he did so, he ordered for my father special stage coaches, reducing the journey by two days. I had yet to learn that all happiness and pleasure should be sacrificed in devoted service to my parents. Nishkulanand sings: 'Renunciation of objects, without the renunciation of desires, is short-lived, however hard you may try'. As I think of it, I can even today call before my mind's eye the places where he sat as he went through the different details of the ceremony. There was also my own eagerness to get married. I have never asked her about it, nor am I inclined to do so now. And then there was very little chance of my being faithless at that tender age. If I should be pledged to be faithful to my wife, she also should be pledged to be faithful to me', I said to myself. Refusal to speak to one another thus became the order of the day with us, married children. It was this last thing that saved me from many a pitfall. I have mentioned one circumstance that more or less saved me from the disasters of lustful love. Numerous examples have convinced me that God ultimately saves him whose motive is pure. Parents do not allow young couples to stay long together. That was when I was in the first or second standard. Dorabji Edulji Gimi was the headmaster then. My shyness was one of the reasons for this aloofness, which I now see was wrong. Today I know that physical training should have as much place in the curriculum as mental training. The reason for my dislike for gymnastics was my keen desire to serve as nurse to my father. I saw that a man of truth must also be a man of care. The exemption from exercise was of course obtained, as my father wrote himself to the headmaster saying that he wanted me at home after school. When later, especially in South Africa, I saw the beautiful handwriting of lawyers and young men born and educated in South Africa, I was ashamed of myself and repented of my neglect. I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Geometry was a new subject in which I was not particularly strong, and the English medium made it still more difficult for me. Often I would lose heart and think of going back to the third standard, feeling that the packing of two years' studies into a single year was too ambitious. But this would discredit not only me, but also the teacher; because, counting on my industry, he had recommended my promotion. A subject which only required a pure and simple use of one's reasoning powers could not be difficult. If you have any difficulty, why not come to me? A scientific knowledge of one language makes a knowledge of other languages comparatively easy.", "1887": "Amongst my few friends at the high school I had, at different times, two who might be called intimate. This companion was originally my elder brother's friend. But I dared not go against the opinion of my mother and my eldest brother. Nevertheless I pleaded with them saying, 'I know he has the weaknesses you attribute to him, but you do not know his virtues. He cannot lead me astray, as my association with him is meant to reform him. I beg you not to be anxious on my account.' A reformer cannot afford to have close intimacy with him whom he seeks to reform. He informed me that many of our teachers were secretly taking meat and wine. I asked my friend the reason and he explained it thus: 'We are a weak people because we do not eat meat. They were both hardier, physically stronger, and more daring. He was an adept in high and long jumping. He could put up with any amount of corporal punishment. I knew that she had more courage than I, and I felt ashamed of myself. We managed somehow for a few weeks on these stolen coppers. We got them and began this kind of smoking. But we were far from being satisfied with such things as these. It was unbearable that we should be unable to do anything without the elders' permission. We heard that Dhatura seeds were an effective poison. And since then, whenever I have heard of someone threatening to commit suicide, it has had little or on effect on me. Ever since I have been grown up, I have never desired to smoke and have always regarded the habit of smoking as barbarous, dirty and harmful. I wrote it on a slip of paper and handed it to him myself. He was then suffering from a fistula and was confined to bed. If I were a painter I could draw a picture of the whole scene today. I would only go out for an evening walk either when he permitted me or when he was feeling well. At the same time my father was getting worse every day. As the last and only resort he had recommended a surgical operation. But the family physician came in the way. But up to the last he refused to do anything of the kind, always insisting on going through the strain of leaving his bed. I should regard such cleanliness as quite consistent with Vaishnavism. But my father's insistence on leaving the bed only struck me with wonder then, and I had nothing but admiration for it. I was glad and went straight to the bed-room. I knew of course that he was very ill, and so I guessed what 'very ill' meant at that moment. The shame, to which I have referred in a foregoing chapter, was this shame of my carnal desire even at the critical hour of my father's death, which demanded wakeful service. Hence I could gain nothing from the Haveli. During part of his illness my father was in Porbandar. His faith it, it was said, had made him whole. Surely, thought I, a religion that compelled one to eat beef, drink liquor, and change one's own clothes did not deserve the name. There was a cousin of mine, still alive, for whose intellect I had great regard. These questions ought not to be raised at your age.' Chapters about diet and the like in Manusmriti seemed to me to run contrary to daily practice. Manusmriti at any rate did not then teach me ahimsa. I remember to have killed at that age bugs and such other insects, regarding it as a duty. The general poverty of the country naturally led Kathiawad students to prefer the nearer and the cheaper centre. This was my first journey from Rajkot to Ahmedabad and that too without a companion. There was a college in Bhavnagar as well as in Bombay, and as the former was cheaper, I decided to go there and join the Samaldas College. In conversation with my mother and elder brother, he inquired about my studies. And none of you can expect to succeed to your father's gadi without having had a proper education. Think of that barrister who has just come back from England. He could get the Diwanship for the asking. It was no easy business to pass examinations quickly. Could I not be sent to qualify for the medical profession? He had you in mind when he said that we Vaishnavas should have nothing to do with dissection of dead bodies. It is the wisest thing therefore to become a barrister.' Turning to my mother he said: 'Now, I must leave. Be sure to let me know if I can assist in any way.' How was he to find the wherewithal to send me? This is how she tried to put me off: 'Uncle,' she said, 'is now the eldest member of the family. It was a five days' bullock-cart journey. When I meet these big barristers, I see no difference between their life and that of Europeans. At the threshold of death, how dare I give you permission to go to England, to cross the seas? But would you not recommend me to Mr. Lely?' ' I wrote to Mr. Lely, who asked me to see him at his residence. I thought of my elder brother, in whom I had the utmost faith. If there were any such danger, would Joshiji let me go?' ' This done, my mother gave her permission. He put the money for my  travelling expenses in the keeping of a brother-in-law, and left word  with some friends to give me whatever help I might need. One is obliged  to eat and drink with Europeans!' The order had no effect on me, and I took my leave of the Sheth. Fortunately he remained firm and wrote to assure  me that I had his permission to go, the Sheth's order notwithstanding. But he referred to the order of the Sheth and said that he could  not afford to lose caste. But this dislike was nothing before  the desire to go to England, which was uppermost in me. Tryambakrai Mazmudar,  the Junagadh vakil. But as the days passed, I became fidgety. I felt shy  even in speaking to the steward. I had to frame every sentence in my  mind, before I could bring it out. Mazmudar kept pleading with me to associate  with the passengers and to talk with them freely. He told me that  lawyers should have a long tongue, and related to me his legal  experiences. But nothing could make me conquer my  shyness. He laughed at my  insistence on abjuring meat, and said in a friendly way when we were in  the Red Sea: 'It is all very well so far but you will have to revise  your decision in the Bay of Biscay. Don't you see that I am not asking you to take  liquor, though I do so? I  left in charge of an agent of Grindlay and Co. all my kit, including the  keys, seeing that many others had done the same and I must follow suit. Someone on board had  advised us to put up at the Victoria Hotel in London. The shame of being the only person in white  clothes was already too much for me. Dr. Mehta looked somewhat angrily at what I was  doing and stopped me. The incident was a  warning for the future. Do not ask questions as we  usually do in India on first acquaintance; do not talk loudly; never  address people as \"sir\" whilst speaking to them as we do in India; only  servants and subordinates address their masters that way.' We deferred  consideration of the matter until Monday. When I did not like one thing, I asked  for another, but had to pay for both just the same. At night the tears would  stream down my cheeks, and home memories of all sorts made sleep out of  the question. It was impossible to share my misery with anyone. Everything was strange \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the people, their ways, and even  their dwellings. I was a complete novice in the matter of English  etiquette and continually had to be on my guard. Even the dishes that I  could eat were tasteless and insipid. I gratefully accepted the suggestion and removed to the friend's rooms. It is pure  superstition to stick to such a promise. You took it where it was absolutely unnecessary, and will  not where it is quite essential. The more he argued, the more uncompromising I became. I always glanced over The Daily News, The Daily Telegraph, and The Pall Mall  Gazette . During these wanderings I once hit on a vegetarian restaurant  in Farringdon Street. The sight of it filled me with the same joy that a child feels on getting a thing  after its own heart. I saw among them Salt's  Plea for Vegetarianism. This I purchased for a shilling and went straight to the dining room. I read Salt's book from cover to cover and was very much impressed by it. From the  date of reading this book, I may claim to have become a vegetarian by  choice. My faith in vegetarianism grew on me from day to day. Dr. Allinson's writings on health and hygiene were  likewise very helpful. Himself a vegetarian, he  prescribed for his patients also a strictly vegetarian diet. Health was the principal  consideration of these experiments to begin with. He  therefore made one last effort to reform me. With considerable hesitation I told him  that I wanted to inquire if the soup was a vegetable soup. ' Feed in some other restaurant and  await me outside.' There was a vegetarian  restaurant close by, but it was closed. But I decided that I should put him at ease, that I should assure him that I would be  clumsy no more, but try to become polished and make up for my  vegetarianism by cultivating other accomplishments which fitted one for  polite society. The clothes after the Bombay cut that I was wearing were, I thought, unsuitable for  English society, and I got new ones at the Army and Navy stores. It was not correct to wear a ready-made tie and I  learnt the art of tying one for myself. While in India, the mirror had  been a luxury permitted on the days when the family barber gave me a  shave. As if all this were not enough to make me look the thing, I directed my attention  to other details that were supposed to go towards the making of an  English gentleman. French was not only the language of  neighbouring France, but it was the lingua franca of the  Continent over which I had a desire to travel. But Mr. Bell rang the bell of alarm in my ear and I awoke. If  my character made a gentleman of me, so much the better. She was  rather friendly to me, so I told her how I had discovered that I was  pursuing a false ideal. This infatuation must have lasted about three months. My weak English was a perpetual worry to me. It was an almost  impossible task for me. Chemistry which was my  subject in science had no attraction for want of experiments, whereas it  ought to have been a deeply interesting study. This time, however, I chose Heat and Light instead of  Chemistry. The thought of my struggling brother, who nobly  responded to my regular calls for monetary help, deeply pained me. That would be a saving of four to  five pounds each month. On the contrary the change harmonized my inward and outward life. My life was certainly  more truthful and my soul knew no bounds of joy.", "1888": "It would be out of place here to describe fully the  condition of Indians in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. They made representations  and petitions, but in vain. It  was slightly amended in 1886, and it was provided under the amended  law that all Indians should pay a poll tax of \u00c2\u00a33 as fee for entry  into the Transvaal. Those who passed as 'Arabs' were, as  a matter of favour, exempted from it. I often  went out at night for a walk with Mr. Coates, and we rarely got back  home much before ten o'clock. I nearly always went along the footpath past this patrol  without the slightest hitch or hindrance. Now the man on duty used to be changed from time to time. Before I could question him as to his  behaviour, Mr. Coates, who happened to be passing the spot on  horseback, hailed me and said: 'Gandhi, I have seen everything. I shall gladly be your witness in  court if you proceed against the man. He no doubt treats Negroes just  as he has treated me. So I do not intend to proceed  against him.' ' But I never again went through this street. I thus made an intimate study of the hard condition of the Indian  settlers, not only by reading and hearing about it, but by personal  experience. I saw that South Africa was no country for a self-respecting Indian, and my mind became more and more occupied with the question as to how this state of thing might be improved. It was likewise here that I learnt the secret  of success as a lawyer. There were numerous points of  fact and law in this intricate case. I read all the papers pertaining to the transactions. Although, as I have said before, I took a keen interest in religious  communion and in public work and always gave some of my time to  them, they were not then my primary interest. I recalled the late Mr. Pincutt's advice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c facts are three-fourths  of the law. In despair I approached  Mr. Leonard for help. I suggested to  him that, if an arbitrator commanding the confidence of both parties  could appointed, the case would be quickly finished. Dada Abdulla should allow him to pay in  moderate installments. The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that a  large part of my time during the twenty years of my practice as a  lawyer was occupied in bringing about private compromises of  hundreds of cases. He took me to the  Wellington Convention. It was his firm conviction that God could not but  listen to prayer fervently offered. To act against it would be difficult and painful  to me. Though the manager of the station hotel agreed to take me in after  much altercation, he absolutely refused to admit me to the  dining-room. At Wellington also I stayed with Mr. Baker. This Convention was an assemblage of devout Christians. But I saw no  reason for changing my belief \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my religion. Metaphorically  there might be some truth in it. His death  on the Cross was a great example to the world, but that there was  anything like a mysterious or miraculous virtue in it my heart could  not accept. I had seen  in other lives just the same reformation that I had heard of among  Christians. Philosophically there was nothing extraordinary in  Christian principles. I shared this mental churning with my Christian friends whenever  there was an opportunity, but their answers could not satisfy me. Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the  greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being  such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. These included  Panchikaran, Maniratnamala, Mumukshu Prakaran  of Yogavasishtha, Haribhadra Suri's Shaddarshana Samuchchaya  and others.", "1890": "As I searched myself deeper, the necessity for changes both internal and  external began to grow on me. As soon as, or even before, I made  alterations in my expenses and my way of living, I began to make changes  in my diet. I saw that the writers on vegetarianism had examined the  question very minutely, attacking it in its religious, scientific,  practical and medical aspects. According to the practical and economic argument they had demonstrated  that a vegetarian diet was the least expensive. There were two divisions in the restaurants I used to visit. There were many minor experiments going on along with the main one; as for example,  giving up starchy foods at one time, living on bread and fruit alone at  another, and once living on cheese, milk and eggs. I came across  three definitions of meat in England. But I was convinced that my mother's definition was  the definition binding on me. The real ordeal, however, was still to come, and that was in respect of the other  vow. Another is to accept the interpretation of the weaker party, where there  are two interpretations possible. My mother's interpretation of meat  was, according to the golden rule, the only true one for me, and not the  one my wider experience or my pride of better knowledge might have  taught me. But this brief and modest experience gave me some little  training in organizing and conducting institutions. I thought it wrong to be  absent, and felt it cowardice to register a silent vote. Mr. Hills regarded these methods as  cutting at the root of morals. I had  a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was  quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because  he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the  society. I went to the meeting with the document in my  pocket. We stayed there with a vegetarian family. My last effort to make a public speech in England was on the eve of my departure  for home. All dinners are meant for enjoyment, but the  West has developed the thing into an art. I therefore began with it and stuck there. My  memory entirely failed me and in attempting a humorous speech I made  myself ridiculous. It was only in South Africa that I got over this shyness, though I never completely  overcame it. It was impossible for me to speak impromptu. There is no chairman of  a meeting who is not pestered with notes for permission to speak. There were comparatively few Indian students in England forty years ago. My cowardice was on a par with my reserve. She was flying like a bird whilst I was wondering when I  should get back home. I once went to Brighton, another  watering-place like Ventnor. The old lady went on spreading her net wider every day. She would then have not thought of an  engagement between us. If I  declare the truth, I might yet be saved more misery.' You have taken  care of me even as a mother of her son. I knew that  Indian students in England dissembled the fact of their marriage and  I followed suit. But I am glad God has now given me the courage to speak out  the truth. In order that  things should not go beyond the present stage, I must tell you the  truth. ' Almost by return post came her  reply somewhat as follows: 'I have your frank letter. We were both very glad and had a hearty laugh  over it. The untruth you say you have been guilty of is pardonable. But it is well that you have acquainted us with the real state of  things. If a  believer, he will say God saved him. A knowledge  of religion, as distinguished from experience, seems but chaff in  such moments of trial. It was in England that I first discovered the  futility of mere religious knowledge. It has many houses with women of ill fame,  women not actually prostitutes, but at the same time, not very  scrupulous about their morals. We returned from the Conference in the evening. Just when I was about to go beyond the limit,  leaving the cards and the game to themselves, God through the good  companion uttered the blessed warning: 'Whence this devil in you, my  boy? Only richer experience can  help me to a fuller understanding. Supplication, worship, prayer are no  superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of eating,  drinking, sitting or walking. It is in itself independent of any sensuous  effort. She introduced me to Narayan  Hemchandra. Such a queer-looking and queerly dressed person was bound to be singled out  in fashionable society. ' I shall be happy to teach you anything I can, and will try my best. I shall also bring with me a Translation  Exercise Book.' I always content myself with  bringing out the spirit. I know Marathi, Hindi,  Bengali, and now I have begun to know English. I am told that language has  an extensive literature. While going to  America also I shall travel on deck.' Once he somehow hunted out mung1 cooked it  and brought it to my place. This led on to a  regular system of exchange between us. The dock labourers' strike had  come to an early termination owing to the efforts of John Burns and  Cardinal Manning. Tell him I am  an author and that I want to congratulate him personally on his  humanitarian work, and also say that I shall have to take you as  interpreter as I do not know English.' In two or three days came Cardinal Manning's  card in reply giving us an appointment. Great men never look at a  person's exterior. I hope your stay in London will agree with you  and that you will get in touch with people here. Once Narayan Hemchandra came to my place in a shirt and dhoti. The good landlady opened the door, came running to me in a fright \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was a new landlady who did not know Narayan Hemchandra \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and  said: 'A sort of a madcap wants to see you.' Well, they ran after me, but I did not mind them and they were quiet.' I had read a lot about the fashions and frivolity of Paris. But the youngsters he has appointed to instruct us also  feel as though they had come as our masters.' But he was not the man to be easily convinced. ' 'What else but grief can you hope to come to after having cast in  your lot with me?' Have I not told you times without  number that ultimately a deceiver only deceives himself?' Well, then,' said he, 'continue to be  deceived. May God show  you the right path and protect you.' Whilst the others stayed there, I returned home. He gave us clearly to understand that he was our head in all  matters, military and non-military, giving us at the same time a  taste of his authority. He said: 'We must have  all orders through you. I also set out  the grievances and requests that had been brought to my notice,  namely, that grievous dissatisfaction had been caused by the  appointment of section leaders without reference to the feeling of  the members of the Corps; that they be recalled, and the Corps be  invited to elect section leaders, subject to the Commander's  approval. I pointed out that, although I occupied no  official rank in the South African Indian Ambulance Corps at the  time of the Boer War, there was never a hitch between Colonel Gallwey  and the Corps, and the Colonel never took a step without  reference to me with a view to ascertain the wishes of the Corps. Suffice it to say that my  experience was of a piece with the experiences we daily have in  India. Those whom the Commanding Officer could persuade went  to Netley. Only I remained away, lying on my back and making the best of a bad  job. My  dietetic experiments were going on even then. I completely eschewed milk, cereals,  pulses and other things. He liked it, but I saw that he was agreeable to  my giving it up if my health demanded it. So I had to decide for  myself according to the dictates of the inner voice. I finally decided to adhere to  the experiment in so far as the motive behind was chiefly religious,  and to yield to the doctor's advice where the motive was mixed. Religious considerations had been predominant in the giving up of  milk. In the evening Kallenbach and I called on Gokhale at the National  Liberal Club. I gently but firmly replied: 'I am willing to yield on all points  except one about which I beg you not to press me. 'I am afraid I cannot decide otherwise,' said I. 'I know that my  decision will pain you, but I beg your forgiveness.' The doctor expressed dissent, but was helpless. I took it for a day or two, but it increased my pain. The doctor of  course went on with his external treatment. I explained to him how I had pledged myself not to  take milk. In  fact I want you to do without any fat for some days.' The vegetables were not to be cooked but  merely grated fine, if I could not masticate them. Lady Cecilia Roberts occasionally called on me. Her  friend had not read the label at all. I must skip over many other sweet reminiscences of my contact with  Lady Cecilia. You cannot possibly  go to Netley in this condition. I accepted his advice and began to make preparations for returning to India. It was with considerable difficulty that I managed to undo the  plaster and regain the liberty of having a proper wash and bath. My diet consisted mostly of nuts and fruits. I was eager to reach home and get free from this atmosphere. It was such a joy to get back  to the homeland after an exile of ten years. I had approached India in the ardent hope of  merging myself in him, and thereby feeling free. So far as I can recollect, I have already said that I never resorted  to untruth in my profession, and that a large part of my legal  practice was in the interest of public work, for which I charged  nothing beyond out-of-pocket expenses, and these too I sometimes met  myself. They seem to think that, if I described however slightly, some  of the occasions when I refused to swerve from the truth, the legal  profession might profit by it. As a student I had heard that the lawyer's profession was a liar's  profession. But this did not influence me, as I had no intention of  earning either position or money by lying. I remember only one occasion  when, after having won a case, I suspected that my client had  deceived me. There was one case which proved a severe trial. Ultimately the book-keeping portion of it was  entrusted by the court to the arbitration of some qualified  accountants. I said: 'I feel that both our client and we ought to run the risk. 'But why should we make the admission at all?' I humbly answered: 'If you will not argue, then I am prepared to do  so, if our client so desires. I shall have nothing to do with the  case if the error is not admitted.' It was intolerable to be accused of sharp practice when  there was not the slightest warrant for it. 'With a judge prejudiced from the start like this, there is little  chance of success in this difficult case,' I said to myself. The Court must presume that you know your case best. On one occasion, whilst I was conducting a case before  a magistrate in Johannesburg, I discovered that my client had  deceived me. So  without any argument I asked the magistrate to dismiss the case. He knew that I  never accepted false cases, and when I brought the thing home to  him, he admitted his mistake, and I have an impression that he was  not angry with me for having asked the magistrate to decide against  him. During my professional work it was also my habit never to conceal my  ignorance from my clients or my colleagues. They were always willing to pay  the fee whenever consultation with senior counsel was necessary. I won his confidence to such an extent that he sought and  followed my advice also in private domestic matters. He was a large importer of goods from Bombay and Calcutta,  and not infrequently he resorted to smuggling. Some  might even have connived at the smuggling. But to use the telling simile of the Gujarati poet Akho, theft like  quicksilver won't be suppressed, and Parsi Rustomji's proved no  exception. 'But is not my confession before you enough?' How will the confession  made before me avail you?' He is a friend too,' said Parsi  Rustomji. Of course you will advise him  whenever necessary.' I am of opinion that the shame lies not  so much in going to jail as in committing the offence. The deed of  shame has already been done. Imprisonment you should regard as a  penance. I also promised to place all the books at his disposal and told him  how penitent Parsi Rustomji was feeling.", "1891": "I have deferred saying anything up to now about the purpose for which I  went to England, viz., A Parsi student, who was also a vegetarian, and I applied,  in the interests of vegetarianism, for the vegetarian courses which  were served to the benchers. The institution had  gradually lost all its meaning, but conservative England retained it  nevertheless. The curriculum of study was easy, barristers being humorously known as  'dinner barristers'. Question papers were  easy and examiners were generous. There was thus little fear of being  plucked, and examinations were held not once but four times in the  year. It was a fraud, I thought, not to read these books. But notwithstanding my study there was no end to my helplessness and  fear. But a separate chapter is needed to describe this helplessness of mine. 31 (including the train  fare) on this journey. But I shall leave the third class passengers at that, and come to my  experience in Benares. But the amount of dakshina  we receive depends upon the will and the ability of the pilgrim.' Where one expected an atmosphere of meditation and communion it was  conspicuous by its absence. But for this  the authorities of the temple could scarcely claim any credit. Instead of this I found a bazar  where cunning shopkeepers were selling sweets and toys of the latest  fashion. I was not therefore in a particularly good mood. He swore at me and said,  'This insult will take you straight to hell.' But the Maharaj was  hardly the man to let the pie go. If I  refuse your pie, it will be bad for you.' The woes of Mahatmas  are known to Mahatmas alone. He proclaimed long ago:  'Whatever a man sows, that shall he reap.' The unpleasant memories of past failure were yet with  me, and I still hated as poison the use of flattery for getting  briefs. I therefore decided to start work first at Rajkot. You will simply try your best, and I am of course  there to assist you.' Not that I knew much of Indian law, but  Kevalram Dave had instructed me very thoroughly. I had heard friends  say, before I went out to South Africa, that Sir Pherozeshah Mehta  had the law of evidence at his finger-tips and that was the secret  of his success. I won the case and gained some confidence. The Judicial Assistant's court was  peripatetic. He was constantly touring, and vakils and their clients  had to follow him wherever he moved his camp. The  inconvenience was no concern of the judge. It was  practically deserted, and I put up in a deserted dharmashala at  some distance from the town. The sahib told his shirastedar: 'Make a note of what Mr. Gandhi says, and let me know  if it is very inconvenient for the vakils or the clients.' As soon as I get it I will  go,' I replied. To consult his wishes was out of the  question. I told him that we were all vegetarians and that I could  not possibly give either of the two things to my son. As you know, I am called in by many Hindu families, and  they do not object to anything I prescribe. 'What you say is quite right,' said I. 'As a doctor you could not do  otherwise. To my  mind it is only on such occasions that a man's faith is truly  tested. Religion, as I understand it, does not permit me to  use meat or eggs for me or mine even on occasions like this, and I  must therefore take the risk that you say is likely. I knew Kuhne's treatment and had tried it too. I  was in Manilal's bed lying by his side. After a short time I returned, my  heart beating within my breast. Father and son fell asleep in the same  bed. He went on thus for forty days on diluted milk and fruit juices. Let everyone decide according to his own faith. For my part I was sure that God had saved my honour, and that belief  remains unaltered to this day. So in consultation with Shri  Revashankar Jagjivan I decided to hire some well-ventilated bungalow  in a suburb of Bombay. I wandered about in Bandra and Santa Cruz. I observed that I was not the  only one to enjoy this pleasure. It seemed to be the fashion and  therefore nothing to be ashamed of. I  wanted them to be free from this spell. The date for the deputation to wait on Mr. Chamberlain had  been fixed.", "1893": "I said in the last chapter that the sea was rough in Bombay harbour, not an  unusual thing in the Arabian Sea in June and July. The outer  storm was to me a symbol of the inner. There was the trouble with the caste that was to confront me. Thus the  acquaintance begun in England continued in India and ripened into a  permanent friendship between the two families. I did not know that she was no more in the  flesh to receive me back into her bosom. He wanted to spare me the blow in a foreign land. My grief was even greater than over my father's  death. But I remember  that I did not give myself up to any wild expression of grief. Dr. Mehta  introduced me to several friends, one of them being his brother Shri  Revashankar Jagjivan, with whom there grew up a lifelong friendship. He was also known as  Shatavadhani (one having the faculty of remembering or attending to a hundred things  simultaneously), and Dr. Mehta recommended me to see some of his  memory feats. I envied his gift without,  however, coming under its spell. Raychandbhai's commercial transactions covered hundreds of  thousands. No knotty  business problem was too difficult for him. Amongst the things on his  business table there were invariably to be found some religious book  and his diary. Much of his published writings is a  reproduction from this diary. I never saw him lose his state of equipoise. Though I was then  groping and could not be said to have any serious interest in  religious discussion, still I found his talk of absorbing interest. I have tried to  meet the heads of various faiths, and I must say that no one else  has ever made on me the impression that Raychandbhai did. The throne has remained vacant and my search still  continues. I believe in the Hindu theory of Guru and his importance in spiritual  realization. An imperfect  teacher may be tolerable in mundane matters, but not in spiritual  matters. My elder brother had built high hopes on me. The desire for wealth and  name and fame was great in him. It is my  conviction that all these good things are due to my non-resistance. Even my stay in  England had not cured me of jealousy. I saw later that all this was  pure folly on my part. My brother had  children, and my own child which I had left at home when I went to  England was now a boy of nearly four. The necessity for food 'reform' was obvious. My brother had thought it fit to  keep some sort of English atmosphere ready for me on my return, and  to that end, crockery and such other things, which used to be kept  in the house only for special occasions, were now in general use. I introduced oatmeal porridge, and  cocoa was to replace tea and coffee. I  completed the Europeanization by adding the European dress. But how was the wherewithal to  be found? the plough is our sandhya and the  spade our daily ritual. I found the barrister's profession a bad job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much  show and little knowledge. The Civil Procedure Code I  could in no way get on with. Sir  Pherozeshah's ability,' he would say, 'lies in his profound  knowledge of law. Badruddin Tyabji's wonderful  power of argument inspires the judges with awe. You should count yourself lucky if you can paddle your own canoe in  three years' time. Expenses in Bombay have gone up frightfully. To him, of course, the case was child's play. He approached me as the worthy son of a worthy father. His case  appeared to be weak, but I consented to draft a memorial for him,  the cost of printing to be borne by him. I drafted it and read it  out to friends. We both came to the conclusion that it was no use  spending more time in Bombay. I should settle in Rajkot where my  brother, himself a petty pleader, could give me some work in the  shape of drafting applications and memorials. And then as there was  already a household at Rajkot, the breaking up of the one at Bombay  meant a considerable saving. My little  establishment was thus closed after a stay of six months in Bombay. It took  me quite forty-five minutes, and of course I invariably returned  home on foot. Supposing he  gave the same case to some other barrister he would certainly get  his commission from him.' 'Surely you have not come here to abuse that acquaintance, have  you?' But please hear me out,' said I. That made him more angry. If you make no amends,  I shall have to proceed against you.' Quick came the answer through his sowar: 'You were rude to me. Even after he asked you to  leave the office, you did not do so. He was grieved, but was at a loss as to how  to console me. This shock  changed the course of my life. But his impatience  and overbearing anger were out of all proportion to my mistake. It was usual for him to insult  his visitors. Meanwhile I began to learn something of the petty politics of the country. Probandar was then under administration, and I had some work there in the  shape of securing more powers for the prince. This officer, though an Indian, was, I  found, one better than the sahib in  arrogance. He was able, but the ryots appeared to me to be none the  better off for his ability. It struck  me that their cause was not even carefully gone into. At  the most I could have appealed to the Political Agent or to the  Governor who would have dismissed the appeal saying, 'We decline to  interfere.' If you sent your brother  there, he would be useful to us and also to himself. He would be  able to instruct our counsel better than ourselves. You will, of course, be our guest and hence  will have no expense whatever.' When starting for South Africa I did not feel the wrench of separation  which I had experienced when leaving for England. But the attraction of  South Africa rendered the separation bearable. ' Here I was to get my passage through the agent of Dada Abdulla and  Co. But no berth was available on the boat, and if I did not  sail then, I should be stranded in Bombay. ' Your meals can be arranged for in  the saloon.' Those were the days of my first class traveling, and  how could a barrister travel as a deck passenger? With the agent's  consent I set about securing it myself. I went on board the boat and  met the chief officer. He said to me quite frankly, 'We do not  usually have such a rush. The Captain and I had become great friends by this time. The tide was high in the  harbour and our boat had more than its proper load. The first whistle to start had already gone. The Captain was witnessing our plight from the bridge. The halt  here was a long one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eight or ten days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we then changed to another  boat. And little did the Captain know  what an ignoramus I was in such matters. Heaven only knows what the poor woman  must have thought of me. The port of Natal is Durban also known as Port Natal. My dress marked me out from other  Indians. There was no meaning in sending me there immediately. He was proud of Islam and loved to discourse on Islamic philosophy. On the second or third day of my arrival, he took me to see the Durban court. Those wearing the Musalman costume might, he  said, keep their turbans on, but the other Indians on entering a  court had to take theirs off as a rule. Another was  that of Hindu, and yet another of Parsi, clerks. The Parsi clerks would call themselves Persians. These three  classes had some social relations with one another. The other three classes had none but business relations  with this class. But Abdulla Sheth disapproved of the idea. He said, 'If you do  anything of the kind, it will have a very bad effect. It was considered degrading to serve as a waiter in a hotel. The belief persists even today among many. Some supported me while others severely criticized my temerity. I was perplexed, and wondered where to go, as I  feared that no hotel would accept me. I see,' said he, 'that you are an utter stranger here, without any  friends. I am now  more or less acquainted with the conditions here, and I understand  your difficulty. I was shown into a room, where I now sat waiting for the dinner and  musing, as I was quite alone. I thanked him again, went to the dining-room and had a hearty dinner. The case is a prolonged and complicated one, so I shall  take your assistance only to the extent of getting necessary  information. And of course you will make communication with my  client easy for me, as I shall now ask for all the information I  want from him through you. I thought I had better do so after  having seen you. I think she will take  you and thus add to her income at the same time. I  shall be glad if you will join us there. I had little time for reflection just yet. I returned home, had my dinner, went to my room and  lay there absorbed in deep thought. What shall I gain from his  religious co-workers? And how  was I to understand Christianity in its proper perspective without  thoroughly knowing my own religion? May the Lord Jesus who has saved us save him  too. In pure faith I consented to read all those  books, and as I went on reading them we discussed them. I do not know its mysterious significance. When, with the passage of time, it wears away and breaks of its own  accord, I shall have no desire to get a new one. It is His word that those who believe in Him shall have  everlasting life. And as we  believe in the atonement of Jesus, our own sins do not bind us. It is impossible to live in this world sinless. The argument utterly failed to convince me. I humbly replied:  'If this be the Christianity acknowledged by all Christians, I  cannot accept it. Some of the books that came into my hands  were full of devotion. There was no public movement  that could be conducted without him. I made his acquaintance the  very first week and told him of my intention to get in touch with  every Indian in Pretoria. I strongly contested the  position in my speech and awakened the merchants to a sense of their  duty, which was two-fold. I saw that I made a considerable impression on the meeting. I undertook,  besides, to teach a class, if one was started, or personally to  instruct individuals desiring to learn the language. I had no misgivings  regarding my capacity to teach. Tyeb Sheth had also given me similar papers. So I went back to Durban and began to make preparations for my  return home. But Abdulla Sheth was not the man to let me sail  without a send-off. As you know all our trade in the Orange Free State  has been swept away. He is a great fighter, and there being no love  lost between him and the Wharf Engineer, he feared that the  Engineer might deprive him of his votes and defeat him at the  election. The other guests were listening to this conversation with attention. All the others chimed in : 'Indeed, indeed. And as you know, I am not acquainted  with all these friends. Thus we may have to send telegrams, we may have to print some  literature, some touring may have to be done, the local attorneys  may have to be consulted, and as I am ignorant of your laws, I may  need some law-books for reference. And it is clear that one man is not enough for this work. The farewell party was thus turned into a working committee. The rest were written by others  to someone's dictation. Five copies were thus got ready  simultaneously. My argument centred round a  principle and on expedience. Ten thousand signatures were obtained in the course of a fortnight. The villages were scattered at long distances. The work  could be done promptly only if a number of workers put their whole  heart into it. They brought in the largest  number of signatures. Dada Abdulla's house  became at once a caravanserai and a public office. A number of  educated fiends who helped me and many others had their food there. A thousand copies had been  printed for circulation and distribution. I also had the idea that I could not  add to the credit of the community, unless I lived in a  style usual for barristers. 'No, I could not thus charge you for public work,' said I. 'The work  would not involve the exercise on my part of much skill as  barrister. My work would be mainly to make you all work. For one thing I am not a white barrister. Nor can I be sure how I shall  fare as a lawyer. So even in giving me retainers you may be running  some risk. But the Law Society of Natal set out  to persuade the Supreme Court to act in contravention of this  principle and to belie its symbol. I applied for admission as an advocate of the Supreme Court. Mr. Escombe, who, as we have seen, was legal adviser to  Messrs. Dada Abdulla & Co, was the Attorney General. The Law Society now sprang a surprise on me by serving me with a  notice opposing my application for admission. Natal owed its growth to European enterprise, and  therefore it was necessary that the European element should  predominate in the bar. The Law Society had engaged a distinguished lawyer to support their  opposition. Then  he said:  'I have nothing to say against you. This talk enraged me, but I restrained my feelings. ' If I had  attached Dada Abdulla's certificate,' said I to myself, 'it would  have been rejected, and they would have asked for Europeans'  certificates. How could my birth, whether humble or  objectionable, be used against me?' Sheth Abdulla's affidavit was prepared and duly submitted to the  counsel for the Law Society. I stood up and took the oath before the Registar. I pacified the friends somewhat with these and similar arguments,  but I do not think I convinced them completely, in this instance, of  the applicability of the principle of looking at a thing from a  different standpoint in different circumstances. But all my life  through, the very insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the  beauty of compromise. The opposition of the Law Society gave me another advertisement in  South Africa. I  shall do what I can, but you must try your best to placate the  Europeans, if you wish to live in their midst.' It was an eye-opener for us all, and I saw that  we should start with our work de novo. As a matter of fact there was nothing wrong about Mr. Chamberlain's  reply. The argument seemed to be quite  plausible. You know that I have been a resident of the Transvaal.' I now had a fair idea of the difficulties ahead. On reaching  Pretoria I drafted the memorial. The Pretoria Indians had already come to know that the  officers wanted to exclude me. The officers had of course sent telegrams to Durban, and when they found  that I had entered with a permit, they were disappointed. In South Africa the  Europeans were settled emigrants. I was first summoned to see  the chief of the department, an officer from Ceylon. Indian leaders often had to visit the Asiatic officers. Have we not been appointed to protect  you? The Sahib ordered Tyeb Sheth to fetch me before him. 'But don't you know that you have no right to come here? The permit  you hold was given you by mistake. With this he bade me good-bye, giving me no opportunity  for a reply. We had a letter from the Chief of the Asiatic  Department to the effect that, as I had seen Mr. Chamberlain in  Durban, it had been found necessary to omit  my name from the deputation which was to wait on him. Mr. Chamberlain is not going to argue the matter with us. Too true,' said I. 'But even the community will have to pocket  insults like these. Come what may, why should we swallow a fresh insult? I pacified my friends  and advised them to have, in my place, Mr. George Godfrey, an Indian  barrister. Let us forget the  past and think of the task before us.' Through the good offices of a house agent known to  him, I succeeded in securing suitable rooms for my office in the  legal quarters of the city, and I started on my professional work. As though we were old friends he discussed my future  welfare. ' We in America regard it as a religious obligation  to get insured. Can I not tempt you to take out a small policy?' Man, you have sold almost all the ornaments of your  wife,' I said to myself. ' If something were to happen to you, the  burden of supporting her and the children would fall on your poor  brother, who has so nobly filled the place of father. I did not know how long I should  have to stay in South Africa. There  used to be readings from theosophical books, and sometimes I had  occasion to address their meetings. I explained that my  Samskrit study was not much to speak of, that I had not read the  Hindu scriptures in the original, and that even my acquaintance with  the translations was of the slightest. I had one or two  translations, by means of which I tried to understand the original  Samskrit. For this purpose I employed the time of my morning ablutions. The first I used to do standing  in western fashion. What effect this reading of the Gita had on my friends only they can  say, but to me the Gita became an infallible guide of  conduct. How to  cultivate and preserve that equability was the question. Was not the body itself possession enough? I understood more clearly in the light of  the Gita teaching the implication of the word 'trustee'. My regard  for jurisprudence increased, I discovered in it religion. I should not,  he said, aspire to be wiser than our father. by personal example and discussion with searchers for  knowledge. There was in Johannesburg a vegetarian restaurant conducted by a  German who believed in Kuhne's hydropathic treatment. She was fond of art,  extravagant and ignorant of accounts. This client was most large-hearted and trusting. He said:  'Give away the money, if you like. There  were many other purposes to which I could have applied this amount. But how could trusting Badri be allowed  to suffer? A client friend to whom I spoke about this transaction sweetly chided  me for my folly. You are not going to get back this amount. I kept myself fit with occasional laxatives  and a well-regulated diet. But I could hardly call myself healthy,  and always wondered when I should get free from the incubus of these  laxative medicines. About this time I read of the formation of a 'No Breakfast  Association' in Manchester. I scarcely ever got up before six or  seven. Nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand can  be brought round by means of a well-regulated diet, water and earth  treatment and similar household remedies. Let no one discount these observations because they are being  written in a sickbed.", "1894": "Practice as a lawyer was and remained for me a subordinate occupation. It was not to identify itself with any particular party. It savoured of cowardice to hesitate to  adopt the name. Dada Abdulla's spacious room was packed to the full on that day. Abdulla  Sheth headed the list with \u00c2\u00a32 per month. Two other friends also  put down the same. I thought I should not stint my subscription, and  put down a pound per month. But I  thought that I would not be beyond my means, if I was to pay my way  at all. Thus the work  of collection was considerably facilitated. One could rely on people's promises in most matters except in  respect of money. We expected our host to contribute \u00c2\u00a36, but he refused to give  anything more than \u00c2\u00a33. If we had accepted that amount from him,  others would have followed suit, and our collections would have been  spoiled. Without  properly kept accounts it is impossible to maintain truth in its  pristine purity. Another feature of the Congress was service of colonial-born  educated Indians. The  members met regularly and spoke or read papers on different  subjects. The heart's earnest and pure desire is always fulfilled. The master, getting angry with him, had lost self-control,  and had beaten Balasundaram severely, breaking two of his teeth. I simply  wanted Balasundaram to be released from him. Like the slave the indentured labourer was the property of his  master. I called on the latter and  said to him: 'I do not want to proceed against you and get you  punished. I think you realize that you have severely beaten the man. He very kindly agreed to take on  Balasundaram. The echoes of Balasundaram's case were heard in far off Madras. There was nothing extraordinary in the case itself, but the fact  that there was someone in Natal to espouse their cause and publicly  work for them gave the indentured labourer a joyful surprise and  inspired him with hope. I have said that Balasundaram entered my office, head-gear in hand. A salute even with both  hands was not sufficient. Balasundaram thought that he should follow  the practice even with me. It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves  honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings. At the outset I must explain briefly the genesis of the tax. About the year 1860 the Europeans in Natal, finding that there was  considerable scope for sugar-cane cultivation, felt themselves in  need of labour. When they first welcomed the Indian  labourers, they had not reckoned with their business skill. Through  legislation this antagonism found its expression in the  disfranchising bill and the bill to impose a tax on the indentured  Indians. A deputation composed of Sir Henry Binns and Mr. Mason was sent to  India to get the proposal approved by the Government there. The  Viceroy at that time was Lord Elgin. It was no part of his duty thus to accommodate the Natal  Europeans. It may be possible that the Indian Government had  disapproved of the \u00c2\u00a325 tax from the beginning and reduced it to \u00c2\u00a33,  irrespective of the opposition from the Congress. The breach of faith with the late Mr. Gokhale became  the occasion of the final campaign, in which the indentured Indians  took their full share, some of them losing their lives as a result  of the firing that was resorted to, and over ten thousand suffering  imprisonment. In Durban Mr. Spencer Walton, the  head of the South Africa General Mission, found me out. Mrs. Walton was a very  gentle and talented woman. I liked Mr.  and Mrs. Walton's humility, perseverance and devotion to work, and  we met very frequently. Some friend sent me Narmadashanker's  book Dharma Vichar. But I could not get on very  far, and decided to follow them with the help of some expert when I  returned to India. About the same time I came in contact with another Christian family. The  church did not make a favourable impression on me. The congregation did not strike me as  being particularly religious. Here, at times, I  would involuntarily doze. In fact it may be said that I was warned to visit  it no more. I was then re-reading Arnold's Light of Asia. The innocent boy  was carried away and joined in my praise of the fruit. Every day  he hesitates to eat meat and asks for fruit, reminding me of your  argument. Your discussion should  henceforth be only with us elders. Mr. Jehangir Petit undertook to convene  the meeting under the auspices of the Imperial Citizenship  Association. The Executive Committee of the Association met first  for framing the resolutions to be moved at the meeting. He said 'immediate' indicated a shorter period than the 31st July. Amongst the ladies from Bombay  who formed the deputation, I remember the names of Lady Tata and the  late Dilshad Begam. I had  not expected anything like it when the agitation was launched. In those days I used to travel alone, and had therefore wonderful  experiences. Fortunately I had not then received the stamp of Mahatmaship,  though the shout of that name was quite common where people knew me. I said to them gently: 'It is no trouble to show them my ticket. I was going to Calcutta from Karachi via  Lahore where I had to change trains. It was impossible to find a  place in the train. The young man  went from carriage to carriage entreating passengers but no one  heeded him. I  stood two hours, holding the chain of the upper bunk. They did not tire of worrying  me, neither did I tire of gently replying to them. The meeting was attended by several Englishmen. There were many who aided in the agitation which was started in  1894, but I cannot help saying that potential Satyagraha hastened  the end.", "1896": "To set up a household was no new experience for me. A good servant is essential in every household. In the meanwhile, the cook needed a few days' leave, or for some  other cause was away. To the companion I said, 'From this moment I cease to have anything  to do with you. The incident came as a timely warning in my life. My intentions were pure, and  so I was saved in spite of my mistakes, and this early experience  thoroughly forewarned me for the future. The cook had been almost a messenger sent from Heaven. In 1896 I asked permission to go  home for six months, for I saw that I was in for a long stay there. There could  be no peace until it was abolished. But who was to take charge of the Congress work and Education  Society in my absence? I could think of two men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Adamji Miyakhan and  Parsi Rustomji. There were many workers now available from the  commercial class. At the request of the English friend, who read Urdu with me, I found  out a good Urdu Munshi from among he deck passengers, and we made  excellent progress in our studies. There was no help available, but  the Tamil Self-Teacher  was a well-written book, and I did not feel in need of much outside  help. Most of my reading since 1893 has been done in  jail. But I never  learnt to speak Tamil, and the little I could do by way of reading  is now rusting away for want of practice. The fight in  South Africa was for such, and it was fought by illiterate soldiers;  it was for the poor and the poor took their full share in it. Ignorance of their language, however, was never a handicap to me in  stealing the hearts of these simple and good countrymen. Let me finish the narrative of my voyage. On my way to Bombay the train stopped at Allahabad for forty-five  minutes. The rest of the day was spent in having a look round admiring the  magnificent confluence of the three rivers, the 'Triveni' and planning the work before me. The writing and publication of the pamphlet took about a  month. It had a green cover and came to be known afterwards as the  Green Pamphlet. It was a miniature, but exaggerated,  edition of the picture I had drawn of the treatment accorded to the  Indians in Natal, and it was not in my words. We shall see later on  the effect this had in Natal. That was my first  experiment of having little children as volunteers. The  upper classes raised numerous objections to this last improvement,  and in most cases it was not carried out. The committee had to  inspect untouchables' quarters also. The men and women there were surprised to see us. 'Well, then, you won't mind if we inspect your houses?' There was no fear of an outbreak in those  quarters. It was the place where  refuse and leaves used as dinner-plates used to be thrown over the  wall. It pained me to see so much uncleanliness about a place of worship. Hardly ever have I known anybody to cherish such loyalty as I did to the  British Constitution. The National Anthem  used to be sung at every meeting that I attended in Natal. In those days I believed that British rule was  on the whole beneficial to the ruled. It should be done seriously or not at all. There had hardly been time for me to think  out my speech. However, I went to  Bombay trusting entirely to God. The meeting was held in the hall of the Sir  Cowasji Jehangir Institute. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah  Mehta addressed meetings the hall was always packed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c chiefly by the students intent on hearing him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving not an inch of room. I was trembling as I began to read my  speech. Both expressed their resolve to accompany  me to South Africa. Deshpande had no temptations of marriage,  but he too could not come. On my way back to South Africa I  met one of the Tyabjis at Zanzibar. I knew of his brother Mr.  Barjorji Padshah by his reputation as a 'crank'. I had never met  him, but friends said that he was eccentric. Look,  now, there is not a little to do for our language. But far from giving up my work  in South Africa, I became firmer in my resolve. And for me  the text of the Gita was clear and emphatic:Sir Pherozeshah had made my way easy. He has been taking no part of late in any public  movement. It revealed to me the  secret of his unique popularity. I found him on the Fergusson College grounds. Sir Pherozeshah had  seemed to me like the Himalaya, the Lokamanya like the ocean. In the sphere of  politics the place that Gokhale occupied in my heart during his  lifetime and occupies even now was and is absolutely unique. The very fact that I was busy seeing people at  that hour appealed greatly to this indefatigable savant, and my  insistence on a non-party man for the president of the meeting had  his ready approval, which was expressed in the spontaneous  exclamation, 'That's it,' 'that's it.' After he had heard me out he said: 'Anyone will tell you that I do  not take part in politics. You  need not have the time of the meeting from me. The  Balasundaram incident made a profound impression on the meeting. My  speech was printed and was, for me, fairly long. But the audience  listened to every word with attention. G.  Parameshvaran Pillay placed the columns of The Madras Standard  entirely at my disposal, and I freely availed myself of the offer. He invited me to the Bengal Club, where he was staying. He expressed his sorrow regarding this prejudice of the local  Englishmen and apologized to me for not having been able to take me  to the drawing-room. When I met him, he was surrounded by a number of friends. He said:  'I am afraid people will not take interest in your work. Both are liberal-minded and take a fair share in  public work.' I saw that my task was becoming more and more difficult. However serious a grievance may be in the eyes of the man who  suffers from it, he will be but one of the numerous people invading  the editor's office, each with a grievance of his own. The Statesman and The Englishman  realized the importance of the question. He even allowed me the liberty of making whatever changes  I liked in the leading article he had written on the situation, the  proof of which he sent me in advance. My experience has shown me that we win justice quickest by rendering  justice to the other party. So I addressed a letter to the press, in which I explained why I had  to leave Calcutta so abruptly, and set off for Bombay. Another steamship Naderi also sailed for Durban at the same time. Fortunately my wants were few, and  as I had cultivated the habit of self-help, I needed very little personal  attendance. He seemed to keep nothing private from me. 40 for himself and devotes  the balance to public purposes. At times they were  painful too, containing, as they did, strictures on public men. His private relations and friendships were all for  public good. India's poverty and subjection were matters of constant  and intense concern to him. Today that one thing is enough to engage all my time and energy.' He compared incidentally Ranade, Telang and Mandlik. He  eulogized Telang's charming style and Mandlik's greatness as a  reformer. Citing an instance of Mandlik's solicitude for his  clients, he told us an anecdote as to how once, having missed his  usual train, he engaged a special train so as to be able to attend the court in the interest of his client. Slightly pained he said, 'So you also have failed to understand me! I  envy your liberty to go about in tramcars, but I am sorry I cannot  do likewise. I  believed then, and I believe even now, that, no matter what amount of  work one has, one should always find some time for exercise, just as one  does for one's meals. I told Gokhale that I was  thinking of meeting him. He said: 'What is good of your seeing him? He is a very good man, but I am afraid he will not satisfy you. And about  this time I met Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji. On the way I saw a stream of sheep going to be sacrificed to  Kali. Who would regard killing of animals as religion?' But could you not find any other place in which to worship God?' ' There I spoke to a friend about this cruel form of  worship. The noise and the  drum-beating there deaden all sensation of pain.' I loved  the sequestered site of the Math. Gokhale liked this speech of mine, and he was very glad to hear Dr.  Ray praising it. I  did not like the innumerable little candles burning in the temple,  and the rats running about the sanctum brought to my mind thoughts  of Swami Dayanand's experience at Morvi. The freedom and energy of  the Burmese women charmed just as the indolence of the men pained  me. To begin  with he ridiculed the idea, but when I explained to him what I hoped  to see, he cheerfully approved. He was in his  silk turban, jacket and dhoti. But this was the time when I was full of faith in  my experiments in earth treatment. I had even succeeded in  persuading some of my clients who had faith in my quackery to try  the earth and water treatment. And he  knew my habit of home treatment and had faith enough to trust  himself to me. This sort of dressing went on daily for about a month until the  wound was completely healed. I cannot claim complete success for any  experiment. Even medical men can make no such claim for their  experiments. Only those risks were of a different kind. If poverty is a bar, poor men can never marry. As I  have said in a previous chapter, I had never to argue a thing twice  with Polak. The Registrar of European marriages in the Transvaal could  not register between black or coloured people. So we three went to the Registrar of marriages. To postpone the date of a solemnly  arranged wedding on such a flimsy pretext was more than one could  put up with. So I appeared before him with the couple. He laughed and gave me a note to the Registrar and the marriage was  duly registered. Up to now the Europeans living with us had been more or less known  to me before. At this  stage of my life, my ideas about brahmacharya had not fully  matured, and so I was interesting myself in getting all my bachelor  friends married. West returned with Mrs. West, a beautiful young lady  from Leicester. With Mr. West had come his  mother-in-law too. She put us all to  shame by her industry and her buoyant, cheerful nature. In the same way as I persuaded these European friends to marry, I  encouraged the Indian friends to send for their families from home. I introduced as much simplicity as was possible in a barrister's  house. I can  recall few youngsters in those days fighting shy of work or pleading  fatigue. I even endeavoured to give  it to them myself, but every now and then there was some hitch or  other. But it was been their, as also my, regret that I failed  to ensure them enough literary training. I am quite  clear that I have not been negligent in doing whatever was needful  for building up their character. They deprive them of the spiritual  and social heritage of the nation, and render them to that extent  unfit for the service of the country. Though my sons have suffered for want of full literary education,  the knowledge of the mother tongue that they naturally acquired has  been all to their and the country's good, inasmuch as they do not  appear the foreigners they would otherwise have appeared. He replied immediately  accepting the offer. There was no resistance that one could see. The Medical Officer in charge welcomed  us. They were  surprised at my attitude and specially called and thanked me. They  introduced me to General Mackenzie. All these  gentlemen were volunteers, and as such had received military  training and experience. The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battle. These,  being unattended to, were festering. Besides this work I had to compound and dispense prescriptions for  the white soldiers. Twice or thrice we had to  march forty miles a day.", "1897": "This was my first voyage with my wife and children. A Hindu husband regards himself as lord and master  of his wife, who must ever dance attendance upon him. I believed, at the time of which I am writing, that in order to look  civilized, our dress and manners had, as far as possible, to  approximate to the European standard. The Parsis  used then to be regarded as the most civilized people amongst  Indians, and so, when the complete European style seemed to be  unsuited, we adopted the Parsi style. Of course no one could be  without shoes and stockings. I always  had my answers ready to all these objections. In the same spirit and with even  more reluctance they adopted the use of knives and forks. All became one in face of the common danger. The captain also  joined the passengers in their prayers. His will be done' was the only cry on  every lip. There were of course the usual namaz2  and the prayers, yet they had none of the solemnity of that dread hour. We have seen that the two ships cast anchor in the port of Durban on or  about the 18th of December. No passengers are allowed to land at any  of the South African ports before being subjected to a thorough  medical examination. But this quarantine  order had more than health reasons behind it. The white residents of Durban had been agitating for our  repatriation, and the agitation was one of the reasons for the  order. The whites were holding monster  meetings every day. They were addressing all kinds of threats and at  times offering even inducements to Dada Abdulla and Co. They were  ready to indemnify the Company if both the ships should be sent  back. He was capable and fearless and  guided the Indian community. Thus Durban had become the scene of an unequal duel. For now threats began to be addressed to us also: 'If you  do not go back, you will surely be pushed into the sea. On Christmas Day the captain invited the saloon  passengers to dinner. And with the  exception of a couple of relatives, I did not know the name and  address of even one of the hundreds of passengers on board. Neither  had I said, whilst in India, a word about the whites in Natal that I  had not already said in Natal itself. I had in my speech described Western  civilization as being, unlike the Eastern, predominantly based on  force. I know that  they sincerely believe that what they are doing today is right and  proper. The questioner smiled, possibly distrustfully. We were asked to  submit, if we would escape with our lives. But Mr. Escombe had sent word to the captain that, as the  whites were highly enraged against me and my life was in danger, my  family and I should be advised to land at dusk, when the port  superintendent Mr. Tatum would escort us home. But in any case I am convinced that you ought not to  enter the city stealthily.' Mr Rustomji's house was about two  miles from the dock. But the youngsters  would not let me get into it. I had bruises all over, but no  abrasions except in one place. Dr. Dadibarjor, the ship's doctor,  who was on the spot, rendered the best possible help. Two constables were sent to protect me,  though no such precaution was then needed. I  had also shown him that I had had no hand in bringing the passengers  of the Courland and Naderi to South Africa. The incident added also  to my professional practice. As soon  as it was proved that the Indian could put up a manly fight, he came  to be regarded as a danger. They were translated into Indian languages and fully explained, so  as to bring home to the community their subtle implications. Public work now began to absorb most of my time. Mansukhlal Naazar, who, as I have said, was already in  Durban, came to stay with me, and as he gave his time to public  work, he lightened my burden to some extent. Sheth Adamji Miyakhan had, in my absence, discharged his duty with great credit. And now after considerable experience  with the many public institutions which I have managed, it has  become my firm conviction that it is not good to run public  institutions on permanent funds. A permanent fund carries in itself  the seed of the moral fall of the institution. Institutions maintained on  permanent funds are often found to ignore public opinion, and are  frequently responsible for acts contrary to it. The reader will find the  opinion expressed above amply borne out in the coming narrative. For  these there were schools established by Christian missions, but I  was not prepared to send my children there, as I did not like the  education imparted in those schools. In the  meantime I was making my own attempt to teach them. I advertised for an English teacher who  should teach the children under my direction. Some regular  instruction was to be given them by this teacher, and for the rest  they should be satisfied with what little I could give them  irregularly. This went on for some time, but not to my satisfaction. Later, the eldest son, long after he had come of age,  broke away from me, and went to India to join a high school in Ahmedabad. The other three of my sons have never been at  a public school, though they did get some regular schooling in an  improvised school which I started for the children of Satyagrahi  parents in South Africa. My inability to  give them enough attention and other unavoidable causes prevented me  from providing them with the literary education I had desired, and  all my sons have had complaints to make against me in this matter. Nor do I regret not having  sent them to public schools. I could not afford, I lacked the will, to keep him  always with me. I longed for some humanitarian work of  a permanent nature. I felt strongly  inclined to serve as a nurse in this hospital. I of course used to have a few cases  in the magistrate's court, but most of them were of a  non-controversial character, and Mr. Khan, who had followed me to  South Africa and was then living with me, undertook to take them if  I was absent. The question of the rearing of children had been ever before me. So I  studied the things necessary for safe labour. The couple who realize these things will never have sexual union for  the fulfillment of their lust, but only when they desire issue. I must skip many other experiences of the period between 1897 and 1899  and come straight to the Boer War. I have minutely dealt with the  inner struggle regarding this in my history of the Satyagraha in  South Africa, and I must not repeat the argument here. I invite the  curious to turn to those pages. Suffice it to say that my loyalty to  the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that  war. But Dr. Booth supported it whole-heartedly. There  were many Christian Indians in our corps. Our corps was 1,100 strong, with  nearly 40 leaders, About three hundred were free Indians, and the  rest indentured. The Indian community became better organized. They  were friendly with us and thankful for being there to serve them. We had proposed to come in after the tommies had  finished. The  principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put  their houses in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken  only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. The  community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking  sanitary measures. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897  and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so  in 1899 than in 1897. Thus service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new  implications of Truth at every stage. Truth is like a vast tree,  which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. So I requested my co-workers to relieve me.", "1898": "I am afraid I must continue the digression until the next chapter. But I know that the booklet has profoundly influenced the lives of  many, both in the East and in the West, who have never seen Indian Opinion. For they have been corresponding with me on the subject. Restraint of the sexual and other  passions becomes easy for a man who lives on such food. My  co-workers and I have seen by experience that there is much truth in  the Indian proverb that as a man eats, so shall he become. I tried in vain to rebuild a shattered constitution  without milk. Some  suggested mung water, some mowhra  oil, some almond-milk. But  rather than examine this reasoning, I shall content myself with  merely declaring my firm conviction that, for the seeker who would  live in fear of God and who would see Him face to face, restraint in  diet both as to quantity and quality is as essential as restraint in  thought and speech. In a matter, however, where my theory has failed me, I should not  only give the information, but issue a grave warning against  adopting it. If you will not  remedy this state of things, who will?' I assure you I shall leave no stone  unturned.' Many knew that I was going  to the Police Commissioner practically daily. Both  were cashiered, and the Asiatic department became comparatively  clean, and the Indian community was somewhat reassured. The event enhanced my prestige and brought me more business. But it was now  possible for the honest man to preserve his honesty. I must say that, though these officers were so bad, I had nothing  against them personally. I caught  her by the hand, dragged the helpless woman to the gate, which was  just opposite the ladder, and proceeded to open it with the  intention of pushing her out. I have no parents or  relatives here to harbour me. Being your wife, you think I must put  up with your cuffs and kicks? Let us not be found making scenes like this!' I put on a brave face, but was really ashamed and shut the gate. She has been a faithful nurse throughout my illnesses, serving  without any thought of reward. The incident in question occurred in 1898, when I had no conception  of brahmacharya. This chapter has brought me to a stage where it becomes necessary for me  to explain to the reader how this story is written from week to  week. When I began writing it, I had no definite plan before me. When I began the last chapter I gave it the heading I  have given to this, but as I was writing it, I realized that before  I narrated my experiences with Europeans, I must write something by  way of a preface. I know that I do not set  down in this story all that I remember. If some busybody were to cross-examine me on the chapters already written,  he could probably shed much more light on them, and if it were a  hostile critic's cross-examination, he might even flatter himself  for having shown up 'the hollowness of many of my pretensions.' I must follow  the sage maxim that nothing once begun should be abandoned unless it  is proved to be morally wrong. Not that all who lived with me  liked it. I had some bitter experiences, but these included both Indians  and Europeans. In spite of  them, and in spite of the inconvenience and worry that I have often  caused to friends, I have not altered my conduct and friends have  kindly borne with me. Whenever my contacts with strangers have been  painful to friends, I have not hesitated to blame them. This was the first time that I had English friends to live with me  as intimately as members of my family. I do remember having  had some difficulty in keeping them as members of the family, but I  can certainly say that they had no difficulty in making themselves  perfectly at home under my roof.", "1900": "The Zulu 'rebellion' was full of new experiences and gave me much food  for thought. This  was no war but a man-hunt, not only in my opinion, but also in that  of many Englishmen with whom I had occasion to talk. It  was a sparsely populated part of the country. I had not realized then how indispensable it  was for self-realization, but I clearly saw that one aspiring to  serve humanity with his whole soul could not do without it. With brahmacharya they would be perfectly consistent. Imagination also found free play and opened out limitless vistas of  service. Some of them set themselves bravely to  observe it, and some, I know, succeeded also. I must confess that I had not then fully realized the  magnitude and immensity of the task I undertook. The difficulties  are even today staring me in the face. What formerly  appeared to me to be extravagant praise of brahmacharya  in our religious books seems now, with increasing clearness every  day, to be absolutely proper and founded on experience. The perfection of it  precludes even an impure thought. I have no doubt that there is a key to  lock out undesirable thoughts, but every one has to find it out for  himself. Without an unreserved surrender to His grace, complete mastery over  thought is impossible. The very first change  I made in my mode of life was to stop sharing the same bed with my  wife or seeking privacy with her. It  was clear that a new word must be coined by the Indians to designate  their struggle. As a  result Maganlal Gandhi coined the word Sadagraha (Sat: truth, Agraha:  firmness) and won the prize. But in order to make it clearer  I changed the word to Satyagraha which has since become current in  Gujarati as a designation for the struggle. Therefore, anyone who wishes to consider  these experiments in their strict chronological order will now do  well to keep the history of Satyagraha in South Africa before him. However, as I had adequately realized my  shortcomings, I made great efforts to get rid of them, and thanks to  this endeavour I have all these years pulled on with my body and put  in with it my share of work. It  dawned upon me that fasting could be made as powerful a weapon of  indulgence as of restraint. Talk of this nature sounded quite pleasant in those  days, and did not strike me as at all improper.", "1901": "Mauritius was one of the ports of call, and as  the boat made a long halt there, I went ashore and acquainted myself  fairly well with the local conditions. I thanked him and left them at the next  stop. The President was taken to his camp  with great \u00c3\u00a9clat by the Reception Committee. Lokamanya was put up in the same  block as I. I have a recollection that he came a day later. But I propose to examine in some  detail the appointments in this camp. They seemed to understand, but service  is no mushroom growth. And the  delegates were of a piece with the volunteers. To the Tamil delegates  even the sight of others, whilst they were dining, meant pollution. It was a kitchen, dining room, washroom, all in one  \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a close safe with no outlet. To me this looked like a travesty of Varnadharma.1 If, I said to myself, there was such untouchability between the  delegates of the Congress, one could well imagine the extent to  which it existed amongst their constituents. No one was ready to undertake the cleaning,  and I found no one to share the honour with me of doing it. I saw that, if the Congress session were to be prolonged, conditions would be  quite favourable for the outbreak of an epidemic. He scanned me and said with a smile: 'I can give  you only clerical work. Most of these  letters have nothing in them, but you will please look them through. Acknowledge those that are worth it, and refer to me those that need  a considered reply.' Ghosal did not know me when he gave me the work. But I reassured him: 'Please  don't worry. But young men of today do not realize it. Of course I have  known the Congress since its birth. In fact I may claim a certain  share with Mr. Hume in bringing the Congress into being.' More than one did the work of one, and many  an important thing was no one's business at all. Sir Pherozeshah had of course agreed to admit my resolution, but I  was wondering who would put it before the Subjects Committee, and  when. But I will not allow yours to be passed  over.' ' No, no there is still the resolution on South Africa. Mr. Gandhi  has been waiting long,' cried out Gokhale. ' I had decided not to read my speech but to speak ex tempore. But the faculty for speaking that I had acquired in South Africa  seemed to have left me for the moment. I  had heard others speak for half an hour or three quarters of an  hour, and yet no bell was rung for them. But my childlike intellect thought then  that the poem contained an answer to Sir Pherozeshah.1 There was no  question about the passing of the resolution. Everyone  raised his hand and all resolutions passed unanimously. He  waited for a day or two and then took me personally. Lord Curzon held his darbar about this time. We alone know the insults  we have to put up with, in order that we may possess our wealth and  titles,' he replied. I discovered that these were insignia not of their royalty, but of  their slavery.", "1904": "Though my co-workers and I were relieved of the charge of the patients,  there remained many things arising out of the black plague still to be dealt with. In spite of the many sins of  omission and commission against the Indians that I had laid at the  door of the Municipality, I could not help commending its solicitude  for the white citizens, and I rendered it as much help as I could in  its laudable efforts. I have an impression that, if I had withheld  my co-operation, the task would have been more difficult for the  Municipality, and that it would not have hesitated to use armed  force and do its worst. The Municipal authorities were pleased at  the Indians' behaviour, and much of the future work regarding plague  measures was simplified. I used all the influence I could   with the Indians to make them submit to the\u00c2\u00a0 Municipality's  requirements, and I do not remember anyone having resisted my advice. The location was put under a strong guard, passage in and out being  made impossible without permission. I could not possibly charge any fees for my labours in such a  crisis. I told him that I should have to deposit these moneys with  him. The banks were by no means anxious to accept large amounts of  copper and silver. Within twenty-four hours of their stay they  forgot all their misery and began to live merrily. The reason for this drastic step was the discovery  of some dead rats in the market. One evening a young man dining  at a table a little way off sent me his card expressing a desire to  see me. The same evening we got to know  each other. Indian Opinion was getting more and more expensive every day. The very first report  from Mr. West was alarming. Considerable overhauling will have to be done. On receipt of Mr. West's letter I left for Natal. On  the contrary, the limited reading may be said to have enabled me  thoroughly to digest what I did read. Of these books, the one that  brought about an instantaneous and practical transformation in my  life was Unto This Last. The teaching of Unto This Last I understood to be:  1. Unto This Last made it as clear as daylight for me that the second and the third  were contained in the first. I talked over the whole thing with Mr. West, described to him the  effect Unto This Last had produced on my mind, and proposed that  Indian Opinion should be removed to a farm, on which everyone should labour,  drawing the same living wage, and attending to the press work in  spare time. I do not think I took more than two days to fix up these matters  with the men. Mr. West and I went to inspect the  estate. Adjoining it  was a piece of 80 acres which had many more fruit trees and a  dilapidated cottage. Of these I can single out here only Manganlal Gandhi's name. The idea of having an engine to  work the press had not appealed to me. Everyone, young and old, had to help in folding the  sheets. Let  us do whatever else is humanly possible. It requires relays of four men each, and our own  men are all tired.' I said pointing to them, 'But can't we make use of these  carpenters? And our men are really too  tired,' said West. You rest yourselves and we will work the  wheel. the engine worked almost as soon as he touched it. They would  have been more expensive and would have meant more time, and  everyone was eager to settle down as soon as possible. He had not accepted the new  scheme and was directing the paper from Durban where there was a  branch office for Indian Opinion. His joy knew no bounds when he learnt that the loan of  his book had been so fruitful. ' It will be after a few more chapters that I shall describe how I and  my ideals were saved in a way no one had imagined or expected.", "1906": "We now reach the stage in this story when I began seriously to think of  taking the brahmacharya vow. I had read some where that Mrs. Gladstone insisted on  preparing tea for Mr. Gladstone even in the House of Commons, and  that this had become a rule in the life of this illustrious couple,  whose actions were governed by regularity. Supposing she had been his sister, or his  devoted servant, and ministered to him with the same attention, what  would you have said? Just examine the view-point  suggested by me.' But it required a special effort to cultivate equal devotion  between master and servant. What then, I asked myself, should be my relation  with my wife? So long as I was the slave of lust, my  faithfulness was worth nothing. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. I failed because the motive that  actuated the effort was none the highest. Whilst in England I had read something  about contraceptives. I  decided to retire to bed only after the day's work had left me  completely exhausted. The  offer was accepted, as we shall see in another chapter. I had to break up  my household at Johannesburg to be able to serve during the  'Rebellion'. During the difficult marches that had then to be  performed, the idea flashed upon me that, if I wanted to devote  myself to the service of the community in this manner I must  relinquish the desire for children and wealth and live the life of a vanaprastha - of one retired from household cares. The importance of vows grew upon me  more clearly than ever before. The fact, therefore, that I could rest  content with an effort only means that I have not yet clearly  realized the necessity of definite action. ' But that doubt also betrays a lack of clear  perception that a particular thing must be renounced. That is why Nishkulanand has sung:  'Renunciaton without aversion is not lasting.' Now the vow was a sure shield  against temptation. As soon as I was free from ambulance work, I went to  Phoenix, whence I had to return to Johannesburg. I had cut down my heavy household expenses at  Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take, as it were, the  brahmacharya vow. But if it was a matter of ever-increasing joy, let no one believe that it was an  easy thing for me. Even when I am past fifty-six years, I realize  how hard a thing it is. Every day I realize more and more that it is  like walking on the sword's edge, and I see every moment the  necessity for eternal vigilance. The effect on  brahmacharya of different kinds of food can be determined only after numerous  experiments. As an external aid to brahmacharya,  fasting is as necessary as selection and restriction in diet. Fasting, therefore, has  a limited use, for a fasting man may continue to be swayed by  passion. But it may be said that extinction of the sexual passion is  as a rule impossible without fasting, which may be said to be  indispensable for the observance of brahmacharya. Their effort is, therefore, identical with the effort to experience  the bracing cold of winter in the scorching summer months. Both use their ears, but whereas the one hears nothing but praises  of God, the other feasts his ears upon ribaldry. Let no one think that it is impossible because it  is difficult. Collars had to be changed daily and shirts, if  not daily, at least every alternate day. I shall never forget the first collar that I washed myself. But I could not make my friends appreciate the beauty of self-help. My collars were no less stiff or shiny  than others. One such occasion  was the banquet given in his honour by the Johannesburg Indians.", "1908": "Sir Michael O'Dwyer held me responsible for all that had happened in the  Punjab, and some irate young Punjabis held me responsible for the  martial law. But I felt that my position was so correct and above question that  no intelligent person could misunderstand it. He pressed me urgently to come and join him. The railway station was from end to end one  seething mass of humanity. The reasons for that decision  were published at that time, and need not be recapitulated here. Suffice it to say that looking back upon these events from this  distance of time, I still feel that our decision to boycott the  Committee was absolutely correct and proper. Moreover, the evidence published was only a fraction of  what was in the Committee's possession. But it would be another matter and quite  graceful, and reflect great credit on them, if the Musalmans of  their own free will stopped cow slaughter out of regard for the  religious sentiments of the Hindus, and from a sense of duty towards  them as neighbours and children of the same soil. And at one time it  almost looked as if they would really put an end to it. His object was to wreak vengeance on  the British Empire in case justice was denied in the matter of the  Khilafat. There was hardly a man present in that assembly but  had some article of British manufacture on his person. As the Maulana was delivering his speech, it seemed to  me that it was vain for him to talk about effective resistance to a  Government with which he was co-operating in more than one thing, if  resort to arms was impossible or undesirable. The only true  resistance to the Government, it therefore seemed to me, was to  cease to co-operate with it. We are not bound  to retain Government titles and honours, or to continue in  Government service. Indeed when I supported the co-operation resolution at  the Congress which met at Amritsar a month later, I did so in the  hope that the betrayal would never come. Most of the prisoners were released before the  Congress opened. But I felt at that time that the reforms, though  defective, could still be accepted. But experienced stalwarts like the late Lokamanya and  Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das shook their heads. You  could hardly cross from one end to the other. It  was accessible at all odd hours to chance visitors who had the  licence to take as much of his time as they liked. I saw that my participation in the deliberations  on the resolution on the reforms was inevitable. But my suggestion found no favour with these two seniors. The practice in the open session of the Congress so far has been  to take votes by a show of hands with the result that all  distinction between visitors and delegates is lost, while, as for  taking a count of votes in such vast assemblies, we have no means at  all. But Lala  Harkishanlal came to the rescue and undertook to make the necessary  arrangements. ' And as  for taking the count, well, I shall see to that. But you must not  absent yourself from the Congress.' I capitulated; I framed my  resolution, and in heart trembling undertook to move it. Malaviyaji's eye was already scanning every quarter  for a ray of hope. The Lokamanya, to  whom it was next shown, said, 'If C.R. Das approves, I will have no  objection.' I could already see that the late Lokamanya,  the Deshabandhu, Pandit Motilalji and other leaders were pleased  with my work in connection with the Punjab inquiry. They used to  invite me to their informal gatherings where, as I found, resolutions  for the Subjects Committee were conceived. Pandit  Malaviyaji enjoyed the reputation of being the prince among beggars  for the public cause. The generous citizens of Bombay  subscribed most liberally, and the memorial trust has at present a  handsome credit balance in the bank. The  three communities, instead of being bound in a bond of amity and  love, are to all appearance, at war with one another, and the  nation is at a loss as to how to utilize the memorial fund. Kelkar and I.B. Sen  respectively as their proxies. I  regard this constitution with a certain measure of pride. Even in 1915, when I returned to India from South  Africa, I had not actually seen a spinning wheel. We  needed a weaving expert to teach us to weave before we could work  the looms. The object that we set before ourselves was to be able to clothe  ourselves entirely in cloth manufactured by our own hands. The adoption of this practice brought us a  world of experience. We were not in a position  immediately to manufacture all the cloth for our needs. Even today the  out-turn of higher counts by Indian mills is very limited, whilst  highest counts they cannot spin at all. By thus adopting cloth woven from mill-yarn as our wear, and  propagating it among our friends, we made ourselves voluntary agents  of the Indian spinning mills. We saw that the aim of the mills was  more and more to weave the yarn spun by them; their co-operation  with the handloom weaver was not willing, but unavoidable and  temporary. We became impatient to be able to spin our own yarn. It  was clear that, until we could do this ourselves, dependence on the  mills would remain. We could get neither spinning  wheel nor a spinner to teach us how to spin. But  we had no idea that these could be used as spinning wheels. But  even he returned without wresting the secret of the art. So the time passed on, and my impatience grew with the time. Her education, in the accepted  sense of the term, was not much. I came to know her more intimately at the Godhra  Conference. As last, after no end of wandering in Gujarat, Gangabehn found the  spinning wheel in Vijapur in the Baroda State. They expressed to  Gangabehn their readiness to resume spinning, if someone promised to provide  them with a regular supply of slivers, and to buy the yarn spun by  them. The providing of  slivers was found to be a difficult task. On my mentioning the  thing to the late Umar Sobani, he solved the difficulty by  immediately undertaking to send a sufficient supply of slivers from  his mill. I felt ill at ease, continuously  receiving slivers from him. Moreover, it seemed to me to be  fundamentally wrong to use mill-slivers. She found  out weavers to weave the yarn that was spun in Vijapur, and soon  Vijapur khadi gained a name for itself. Maganlal Gandhi, by  bringing to bear all his splendid mechanical talent on the wheel,  made many improvements in it, and wheels and their accessories began  to be manufactured at the Ashram. The first piece of khadi  manufactured in the Ashram cost 17 annas per yard. So I had to dispense with  their service. I am prepared to  admit that its effect was more psychological than physical. A carder twanging his bow used  to pass daily by Sjt. The yarn thus prepared I disposed of to some  Vaishnava friends for making from it the garlands for the pavitra ekadashi. Shivji started a spinning class in Bombay. But she proved equal to the  demand made upon her.", "1911": "It was seen in the last chapter how we provided for the physical  training on Tolstoy Farm, and incidentally for the vocational. Though this was hardly done in a way to satisfy me, it may be  claimed to have been more or less successful. Literary training, however, was a more difficult matter. My knowledge of  the Urdu script was all that I had acquired on a single voyage, and  my knowledge of the language was confined to the familiar Persian  and Arabic words that I had learnt from contact with Musalman  friends. In poverty of  literary equipment my colleagues went one better than I. But my love  for the languages of my country, my confidence in my capacity as a  teacher, as also the ignorance of my pupils, and  more than that, their generosity, stood me in good stead. It was comparatively easier to teach the Musalman  boys Urdu. I had simply to stimulate in them  an interest in reading and to improve their handwriting. These youngsters were for the most part unlettered and unschooled. I remember very little that my teachers  taught me from books, but I have even now a clear recollection of  the things they taught me independently of books. Reading was a task for them, but listening to me was  a pleasure, when I did not bore them by failure to make my subject  interesting. And from the questions that my talks prompted them to  put, I had a measure of their power of understanding. On  one occasion he broke out most violently. But he was adamant and even tried to overreach me. This was an  entirely novel experience for them all. This incident set me thinking and taught me a better method of  correcting students. I do not know whether that method would have  availed on the occasion in question. But  the incident made me understand better the duty of a teacher towards  his pupils. One day he spoke out: 'Your way of mixing your own boys with the bad  ones does not appeal to me. That they have to put up with a good deal of  inconvenience here, you and I know very well. However that  may be, I cannot help keeping them here, and if that means some  risk, we must run it.' If there was the  slightest trace of superiority in them, it was destroyed and they  learnt to mix with all kinds of children. This and similar experiments have shown me that, if good children  are taught together with bad ones and thrown into their company,  they will lose nothing, provided the experiment is conducted under  the watchful care of their parents and guardians.", "1912": "I have described in the last chapter how Kasturbai's illness was  instrumental in bringing about some changes in my diet. While the necessity for avoiding milk in the  interests of self-restraint was growing upon me, I happened to come  across some literature from Calcutta, describing the tortures to  which cows and buffaloes were subjected by their keepers. When I came to know him I was startled at his love of luxury and extravagance. Our acquaintance soon ripened into very close friendship, so much so  that we thought alike, and he was convinced that he must carry out  in his life the changes I was making in mine. 1,200 monthly on  himself, over and above house rent. Now he reduced himself to such  simplicity that his expenses came to Rs. It was during this time that we had the discussion about milk. The fruit diet turned out to be very convenient also. A mind consciously  unclean cannot be cleansed by fasting. To  obviate this tendency dietetic restrictions and fasting would appear  to be necessary. Those who make light of dietetic restrictions and fasting are as  much in error as those who stake their all on them. Just about the time when I gave up milk and cereals, and started on the  experiment of a fruit diet, I began fasting as a means of  self-restraint. I had been  used to fasting now and again, but for purely health reasons. I always helped  and encouraged them in keeping all their religious observances. During this month, therefore, I persuaded the Musalman youngsters to  observe the ramzan fast. Nor had the  Hindu and other youngsters to keep the Musalmans company when they  had their last meal before sunrise next morning, and of course all  except the Musalmans allowed themselves water. But I know that it does not necessarily  follow that fasting and similar disciplines would have the same  effect for all. Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it is undertaken  with a view to self-restraint. Nor did I underrate the building up of the body. Mr.  Kallenbach was fond of gardening and had gained some experience of  this work in one of the Governmental model gardens. Of course some of them, and sometimes all them, malingered  and shirked. I dare say they did not like the strictness, but I  do not recollect their having resisted it. Whenever I was strict, I  would, by argument, convince them that it was not right to play with  one's work.", "1914": "In Johannesburg I had at one time as many as four Indian clerks, who  were perhaps more like my sons than clerks. But even these were not  enough for my work. It was impossible to do without typewriting,  which, among us, if at all, only I knew. Arrears were fast mounting up, so much so  that it seemed impossible for me, however much I might try, to cope  with professional and public work. I  approached a typewriting agent whom I knew, and asked him to get me  a stenographer. 'Don't you mind serving under an Indian?' Before very long she became more a daughter or a sister to me than a  mere stenotypist. Some of her  idiosyncrasies were at times too much for Mr. Kallenbach and me. Colour prejudice was foreign to her temperament. She seemed to mind  neither age nor experience. Her impetuosity often landed me in difficulties, but her open  and guileless temperament removed them as soon as they were created. When I urged her to take more, she would give me a scolding and say,  'I am not here to draw a salary from you. She knew neither night nor day in toiling for the cause. He was pleased with many of  them, and would often give his opinion of them. He gave the first  place to Miss Schlesin amongst all the Indian and European  co-workers. ' One of the contacts, however, should  be mentioned at once. The journal was launched in 1904, and Sjt. Mansukhlal Nazar became the first editor. He had been doing a fair amount of journalism whilst in India,  but he would never venture to write on intricate South African  problems so long as I was there. He had the greatest confidence in  my discernment, and therefore threw on me the responsibility of  attending to the editorial columns. I saw, however, that the Tamil and Hindi  sections were a make-believe. I had no notion that I should have to invest any money in this  journal, but I soon discovered that it could not go on without my  financial help. I remember a time when I  had to remit \u00c2\u00a375 each month. I was  inundated with letters containing the outpourings of my  correspondents' hearts. They were friendly, critical or bitter,  according to the temper of the writer. It was as  though the community thought audibly through this correspondence  with me. It made me thoroughly understand the responsibility of a  journalist, and the hold I secured in this way over the community  made the future campaign workable, dignified and irresistible. It  remains to be seen how far the sacrifice of Andrews and the magic  wand of Sastri succeed in rehabilitating us. These were too  ignorant of the rules of municipal sanitation and hygiene to do  without the help or supervision of the Municipality. The criminal negligence of the Municipality and the ignorance of the  Indian settlers thus conspired to render the location thoroughly  insanitary. Some of them were open- hearted, liberal men  and had high character. Abdulla Sheth refused to address me as Gandhi. The number  of tenants increased, and with them the squalor and the disorder. Madanjit, who was then canvassing subscribers for Indian Opinion and realizing subscriptions, happened to be in the location at this  moment. But twenty-three patients were more than three of  us could cope with. He too,  so far as I can remember, was unmarried. There was no need  at all to consult Kalyandas. Where you are, we will also be,' was their  short and sweet reply. It was a terrible night  \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that night of vigil and nursing. He frankly confessed that the  Town Council had no immediate means to cope with such an emergency,  but promised that they would render all the help in their power. The  Municipality lent the services of a nurse, who came with brandy and  other hospital equipment. The nurse was a kindly lady and would fain have attended to the  patients, but we rarely allowed her to touch them, lest she should  catch the contagion. We had instructions to give the patients frequent doses of brandy. Meanwhile the Municipality was busy taking other measures. I have said in an earlier chapter that I used to have my meals at a  vegetarian restaurant. Lunch also I  would finish before the other guests arrived. I am ready to help in nursing the patients. If there are no more  cases, we shall be free in a day or two. If you could go, I should feel quite  relieved on that score.' He  had had an ordinary school education, but had learnt a good deal in the  school of experience and by dint of self-help. I have always known  him to be a pure, sober, god-fearing, humane Englishman. A medical friend advised a surgical  operation, to which she agreed after some hesitation. In a few days, however, I received a letter to the effect that  Kasturbai was worse, too weak to sit up in bed, and had once become  unconscious. I would never allow my  wife to be given meat or beef, even if the denial meant her death,  unless of course she desired to take it.' She was really too weak to be consulted in this  matter. She gave a resolute reply:  'I will not take beef tea. I told her that she was not bound to follow me. He exclaimed in a rage:  'What a callous man you are! \u00c2\u00a0 She cannot stand the least  little hustling. But if you must persist, you are free to do so. If you will not  give her beef tea, I will not take the risk of keeping her under my  roof even for a single day.' I did not like his carrying on this disputation in the presence of  my wife, but I suffered him to do so out of courtesy. I knew the  verses from the Manusmriti, I did not need them for my conviction. My first experience of jail life was in 1908. Inhibitions imposed from without rarely succeed, but when they are  self-imposed, they have a decidedly salutary effect. So, immediately  after release from jail, I imposed on myself the two rules. I had read and realized  that the weak-bodied should avoid pulses. Now it happened that Kasturbai, who had a brief respite after her  operation, had again begun getting haemorrhage, and the malady  seemed to be obstinate. Hydropathic treatment by itself did not  answer. I was  pained and equally delighted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c delighted in that I got an opportunity  to shower my love on her. If I was  ailing and the doctor advised me to give up these or any other  articles, I should unhesitatingly do so. Knowing you, I should not have provoked you. You will listen to none,'  she said, and sought relief in tears. After this Kasturbai began to pick up quickly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether as a result of  the saltless and pulseless diet or of the other consequent changes  in her food; whether as a result of my strict vigilance in exacting  observance of the other rules of life, or as an effect of the mental  exhilaration produced by the incident, and if so to what extent, I  cannot say. If I was to  be their real teacher and guardian, I must touch their hearts. I  must share their joys and sorrows, I must help them to solve the  problems that faced them, and I must take along the right channel  the surging aspirations of their youth. In those days I had to move between Johannesburg and Phoenix. Once  when I was in Johannesburg I received tidings of the moral fall of  two of the inmates of the Ashram. News of an apparent failure or  reverse in the Satyagraha struggle would not have shocked me, but  this news came upon me like a thunderbolt. So I imposed upon myself a fast  for seven days and a vow to have only one meal a day for a period of  four months and a half. Mr. Kallenbach tried to dissuade me, but in  vain. Thus considerably eased, I reached Phoenix, I  made further investigation and acquainted myself with some more  details I needed to know. Where there is no true  love between the teacher and the pupil, where the pupil's  delinquency has not touched the very being of the teacher and where  the pupil has no respect for the teacher, fasting is out of place  and may even be harmful. During Satyagraha I had begun traveling third class. But there was a good deal  of difference between third class accommodation on the boat on this  route and that provided on Indian coastal boats or railway trains. We had daily discussions over one of these. Every day we had to learn something new in this way, for both of us  were trying to tread the path of Truth. In the march towards Truth,  anger, selfishness, hatred, etc., Sorabji Adajania, my comrade in jail and a Satyagrahi, was  then reading for the bar in London. With him, and through  him, I had conferences with Dr. Jivraj Mehta and others who were  persuing their studies in England. This argument failed to appeal to me then. I  knew the difference of status between an Indian and an Englishman,  but I did not believe that we had been quite reduced to slavery. Colonel Baker was placed in charge of this  work. London in these days was a sight worth seeing. This was  my first acquaintance with her. The saying that life lives on life  has a deep meaning in it. The very  fact of his living \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eating, drinking and moving about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c necessarily  involves some himsa, destruction of life, be it ever so minute. He must always hold himself open to correction, and  whenever he discovers himself to be wrong he must confess it at all  costs and atone for it.", "1915": "Before I reached home, the party which had started from Phoenix had already  arrived. The Gujaratis would not let me  go without a reception, which was organized by the late Uttamlal  Trivedi. He made a short and sweet little speech  in English. In fact I was glad to note that  everyone seemed reconciled to my protest. The moment I reached Bombay Gokhale sent me word that the Governor was  desirous of seeing me, and that it might be proper for me to respond  before I left for Poona. I would like you to come and see me  whenever you propose to take any steps concerning Government.' They are tenacious of their  principles, and quite independent. They are hesitating to take any  risk lest their high regard for you should be jeopardized. Whatever may be the result of your talks with the  members, you must look to me for the expenses of the Ashram, which I  will regard as my own.' But as I was to travel third from Bombay, I  regarded the scarf and the cloak as too much of an encumbrance, so I  shed them, and invested in an eight-to-ten-annas Kashmiri cap. One  dressed in that fashion was sure to pass muster as a poor man. The inspector on finding that I  had a temperature asked me to report myself to the Medical Officer  at Rajkot and noted down my name. His comrade eulogizing him, said:  'Our friend is but a tailor. He leads us all, putting our education to shame.' He  would talk to me every day of Viramgam, and the hardships of the  passengers, which had become absolutely unbearable for him. The Doctor felt ashamed and  was angry with the inspector. He did not know me, and even if he  had known me, he should not have done otherwise. Inspection of third class passengers for sanitary reasons is  essential on such occasions. My experience is that the  officials, instead of looking upon third class passengers as  fellowmen, regard them as so many sheep. The latter expressed his sympathy but shifted  the blame on Delhi. ' And do you think a powerful  Government will yield to threats?' Usually they include  violence as the last remedy. The reception was a beautiful  combination of simplicity, art and love. Some of them strongly approved of the proposal. When I invited the Poet to express his  opinion, he said that he did not mind it provided the teachers were  favourable. A batch was formed to  cut vegetables, another to clean the grain, and so on. It was a delight to me to see them working spade  in hand. Not only was the  Phoenix party's kitchen self-conducted, but the food cooked in it  was of the simplest. I had intended to stay at Shantiniketan for some time, but fate  willed otherwise. And if so, have you  any idea when it will come?' Third class  tickets are not booked so early,' we were told. Someone  kindly directed me to where he was, and I represented to him our  difficulty. The train arrived, and getting into it was another trial. There was  a free exchange of abuse and pushes between passengers already in  the train and those trying to get in. He said, 'You must try to get in where  you can or take the next train.' At Asansol station he came to  charge us excess fares. I said to him:  'It was your duty to find us room. I was not therefore prepared to  fight the guard, so I paid the excess fare he demanded, i.e., up to  Poona. But I can only  touch on them causally in these chapters. All this may be traced to the  indifference towards them of us 'educated' people. Maganlal and I got some water from the  station water-pipe and had our bath. As I was proceeding to arrange  for my wife's bath, Sjt. Kaul of the Servants of India Society  recognizing us came up. This, I know, does not become a votary of truth. This question of membership  proved a very delicate matter for me to handle. I had one  in Gokhale and had felt secure in his keeping. That, I thought, would please Gokhale's spirit. This naturally was more than they could bear. Was it right for me  to be admitted by a majority vote? Therein I thought lay my loyalty to the Society and Gokhale. It  saved them from an awkward position and bound us in closer bonds of  friendship. The withdrawal of my application made me truly a member  of the Society. Experience now tells me that it was well that I did not formally  become a member, and that the opposition of those who had been  against me was justified. Physical relationship divorced from spiritual  is body without soul. The ladies of the house kept awake all night  skinning various nuts. Every possible care was taken in dressing  fresh fruit in the Indian style. Much as I could  appreciate this affectionate hospitality, I could not bear the  thought of a whole household being occupied in entertaining two or  three guests. But as yet I saw no escape from such embarrassing  attentions. But since Dr. Mehta's home was as good as my  own, I could control somewhat the lavishness of the menu. The journey from Calcutta to Hardvar was particularly trying. Sometimes the compartments had no lights. These very Hindus, let it be noted, do not so  much as hesitate or inquire when during illness the doctor  administers them wine or prescribes beef tea or a Musalman or  Christian compounder gives them water. He had to depend on paid scavengers for looking after these. This left me  not a minute which I could call my own. I felt as though I was  between the devil and the deep sea. Whereas travelling, though often trying, has  been uplifting and has hardly ever roused me to anger. There  were those pious souls in the midst of the hypocrisy that surrounded  them. They would be free of guilt before their Maker. If the pilgrimage to Hardvar  and to the Kumbha fair was not sinful, I must impose some act of  self-denial on myself in atonement for the iniquity prevailing there  and purify myself. I was convinced  that, if I did not impose these restrictions on myself, I should put  my future hosts to considerable inconvenience and should engage them  in serving me rather than engage myself in service. I finally decided  that there should be no exception on any account whatsoever. I have been under these vows for now thirteen years. The Mahatma overwhelmed me with affection. When the time came for going away it was a wrench to leave  the place. One of them was  particularly attracted towards me. These are the two external symbols of  Hinduism and every Hindu ought to wear them.' As a result several members of the Gandhi clan adopted the sacred  thread. But I know that I did not go in for a fresh one. I therefore made a clean breast of the whole matter to the Swami and  said:  'I will not wear the sacred thread, for I see no necessity for it,  when countless Hindus can go without it and yet remain Hindus. But  I am sure your suggestion about the shikha is worth considering. I  once used to have it, and I discarded it from a false sense of  shame. The Swami did not appreciate my position with regard to the sacred  thread. The very reasons that seemed to me to point to not wearing  it appeared to him to favour its wearing. So long as there are  different religions, every one of them may need some outward  distinctive symbol. I was charmed with the natural  scenery about Hrishikesh and the Lakshman Jhula, and bowed my head  in reverence to our ancestors for their sense of the beautiful in  Nature, and for their foresight in investing beautiful  manifestations of nature with a religious significance. I was told that originally there had been a fine  rope-bridge. But a philanthropic Marwadi got it into his head to  destroy the rope-bridge and erect an iron one at a heavy cost and  then entrusted the keys to the Government! I am at a loss to say  anything about the rope-bridge as I have never seen it, but the iron  bridge is entirely out of place in such surroundings and mars their  beauty. But the Hardvar experiences proved for me to be of inestimable  value. They helped me in no small way to decide where I was to live  and what I was to do. The pilgrimage to the Kumbha fair was my second visit to Hardvar. Others strongly urged me to  choose Rajkot. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in. 'Where is the untouchable who will satisfy your condition?' I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad. So far as accommodation was concerned, Sjt. There were at this time about thirteen Tamilians in our party. I told everyone to put up  with the abuse and continue drawing water at any cost. The friend who had asked  that question about an untouchable being able to follow the rules of  the Ashram had never expected that any such would be forthcoming. We would rather go and stay in the  untouchables' quarters and live on whatever we could get by manual labour. On  all such occasions God has sent help at the last moment. 'I shall come tomorrow at this time,' he said. ' He placed in my  hands currency notes of the value of Rs. No visit, no enquiries,  simply rendering help and going away! Dudabhai was  a man with slight education but of good understanding. I pleaded with him to swallow minor  insults. Besides, such procedure is outside the limit of this autobiography. I knew Maulana Mazharul Haq in London when he was studying for the  bar, and when I met him at the Bombay Congress in 1915 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the year in  which he was President of the Muslim League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he had renewed the  acquaintance, and extended me an invitation to stay with him  whenever I happened to go to Patna. I had sent a telegram informing  him of my arrival, and he met me at the station with a crowd of  students, though the train reached there at midnight. Professor Kripalani spoke to me about the desperate condition of  Bihar, particularly of the Tirhut division and gave me an idea of  the difficulty of my task. I have,  however, wired to them both, Bapu Brajkishore Prasad and Babu  Rajendra Prasad. But he put me at ease, and so I went  over to stay with him. He and his people showered all their  affection on me. When he won any such case, he consoled himself that he was doing  something good for these poor people. Lawyers labour under the  belief that, if they do not charge fees, they will have no  wherewithal to run their households, and will not be able to render  effective help to the poor people. The figures of the fees they  charged and the standard of a barrister's fees in Bengal and Bihar  staggered me. Nothing less than four figures in any case. Taking such cases to the  courts does little good. The real relief for them is to be  free from fear. 'I shall have little use for your legal knowledge,' I said to them. 'I want clerical assistance and help in interpretation. Even turning yourselves into clerks and  giving up your profession for an indefinite period is no small  thing. I find it difficult to understand the local dialect of Hindi,  and I shall not be able to read papers written in Kaithi or Urdu. Then he asked the vakils the capacity of  their sacrifice. Some of us will be with you for so  much time as you may require. The idea of accommodating oneself to  imprisonment is a novel thing for us. For this purpose it was necessary that I should meet  thousands of the ryots. But I deemed it essential, before starting  on my inquiry, to know the planters' side of the case and see the  Commissioner of the Division. I sought and was granted appointments  with both. The Secretary of the Planters' Association told me  plainly that I was an outsider and that I had no business to come  between the planters and their tenants, but if I had any  representation to make, I might submit it in writing. I kept awake that whole night writing letters and giving necessary  instructions to Babu Brajkishore Prasad. They occupied themselves with regulating the crowds, for the latter  followed me wherever I went. I might have legally  resisted the notices served on me. Instead I accepted them all, and  my conduct towards the officials was correct. It should be remembered that no one knew me in Champaran. In consultation with my co-workers I had decided that nothing should  be done in the name of the Congress. No emissaries had therefore been sent there, openly or secretly, on  behalf of the Congress to prepare the ground for our arrival. I have entered the  country with motives of rendering humanitarian and national service. I knew that the Government attitude countenancing my presence had  displeased the Champaran planters, and I know that even the  officials, though they could say nothing openly, could hardly have  liked it. Pandit Malaviyaji had sent  me an assurance that, whenever I wanted him, I had only to send him  word, but I did not trouble him. For more  details the reader must turn to Sjt. And the people of Motihari had  not yet shed their fear to the extent of renting a house to us. Indeed it\u00c2\u00a0 was found  in the end that we did not need any large amount. Brajkishorebabu and Rajendrababu were a matchless pair. Vindhyababu and Janakdharibabu also came and helped us now and then. It was difficult  to find local teachers who would work for a bare allowance or  without remuneration. My idea was never to entrust children to  commonplace teachers. So I issued a public appeal for voluntary teachers. The experience inspired them with  confidence and interest in their work. She brought  her exceptional gifts to bear on it. The elder people badly needed education in cleanliness. The friends carried out these instructions with  wonderful fidelity. These volunteers had to look after medical relief and  sanitation. No patient was permitted to take home any medicine. But Dr. Dev was not a man easily to lose  heart. This cottage was not an exception, but a type to be found in many  Indian villages. Someone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly some of the neighbouring  planters' men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c set fire to it one night. Sir Edward Gait accepted the condition as just and proper and  announced the inquiry. The tinkathia  system which had been in existence for about a century was thus  abolished, and with it the planters' raj came to an end. Fate  decided otherwise and drove me to take up work elsewhere. So I seized  the first opportunity to go to Ahmedabad. But things did not move as swiftly as I had wished, and I was unable  to return to Champaran, with the result that the schools closed down  one by one. I had seen, in the course of my travels,  that cow protection and Hindi propaganda had become the exclusive  concern of the Marwadis. The educational work in one way or another is going on in many  places. We were not then equal either  to getting the Kochrab people to observe these rules nor to serving  the village otherwise. The plague, I felt, was sufficient notice to quit Kochrab. In about eight days the sale was executed. Our difficulties, before we had permanent living accommodation, were  great. The rains were impending, and provisions had to be got from  the city four miles away. The ground, which had been a waste, was  infested with snakes, and it was no small risk to live with little  children under such conditions. We have had, however, no  loss of life occasioned by snakebite. But if mortal man will dare to describe them, he  has no better medium than his own inarticulate speech. Spinning had not so far been  possible for us.", "1917": "Just as it abounds in mango groves, so  used it to be full of indigo plantations until the year 1917. Brijkishore Babu failed then to  make an impression on me. Having heard from him  something of Champaran, I replied as was my wont: 'I can give no  opinion without seeing the condition with my own eyes. He wanted me  personally to visit Champaran and witness the miseries of the ryots  there. I told him that I would include Champaran in the tour which I  had contemplated and give it a day or two. ' Poor Rajkumar was  more or less as a menial to them. There was strict untouchability in Bihar. All this was far from  surprising or irritating to me, for I was inured to such things. I saw now that  Rajkumar Shukla could not guide me, and that I must take the reins  in my own hands.", "1919": "For the first two weeks the mill-hands exhibited great courage and  self-restraint and daily held monster meetings. Just as physical  weakness in men manifests itself in irascibility, their attitude  towards the blacklegs became more and more menacing as the strike  seemed to weaken, and I began to fear an outbreak of rowdyism on  their part. The  mill-hands had taken the pledge at my suggestion. One morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201cit was at a mill-hands' meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while I was still  groping and unable to see my way clearly, the light came to me. Unbidden and all by themselves the words came to my lips: 'Unless  the strikers rally,' I declared to the meeting, 'and continue the  strike till a settlement is reached, or till they leave the mills  altogether, I will not touch any food.' It would be monstrous if you were to fast. It would be enough  if you could remain true to your pledge. As you know we are without  funds, and we do not want to continue our strike by living on public  charity. As for my fast, it will  be broken only after the strike is settled.' In the meantime Vallabhbhai was trying to find some employment for  the strikers under the Municipality, but there was not much hope of  success there. The duty to undertake it seemed to me to be clear. There is not the slightest  necessity for you to withdraw from your position,' I said to them. It was a  pleasure to be pitched against him. Anandshankar Dhruva  intervened and was in the end appointed arbitrator, and the strike  was called off after I had fasted only for three days. I must not close this chapter without noting here an incident, as  amusing as it was pathetic. And our  philanthropists, instead of providing work for them and insisting on  their working for bread, give them alms. The contention of the cultivators, on the other hand, was  that it was less than four annas. Vallabhbhai Patel, Shankarlal Banker, Shrimati  Anasuyabehn, Sjts. Indulal Yajnik, Mahadev Desai and others. Those  who want to make a fuller and deeper study of this important fight  would do well to read the full and authentic history of the Kheda Satyagraha by Sjt. In spite of my remonstrance, the  Bombay merchants sent us more money than necessary, so that we had  some balance left at the end of the campaign. Once  they had shed the fear of the officials, how could they be stopped  from returning their insults? The attachment officers sold people's cattle and seized  whatever movables they could lay hands on. On the other hand some  were prepared to fight to the bitter end. While these things were  going on, one of Sjt. He thus saved his honour and set a good  example to others. I did not regard this as civil disobedience, but  even if it was, I suggested that this attachment of standing crops,  though it might be in accordance with law, was morally wrong, and was  nothing short of looting, and that therefore it was the people's  duty to remove the onion in spite of the order of attachment. This  was a good opportunity for the people to learn a lesson in courting  fines or imprisonment, which was the necessary consequence of such  disobedience. Mohanlal Pandya it was a thing after his  heart. He did not like the campaign to end without someone  undergoing suffering in the shape of imprisonment for something done  consistently with the principles of Satyagraha. But no appeal was filed as the policy was to avoid the law courts. However, the end was far from making me feel happy, inasmuch as it  lacked the grace with which the termination of every Satyagraha  campaign ought to be accompanied. I was sad that they had not the strength to exercise  the right. They  found their proper sphere of work, their capacity for sacrifice  increased. Public life in Gujarat became instinct with a new energy  and a new vigour. Through  the Kheda campaign Satyagraha took firm root in the soil of Gujarat. Although, therefore, I found nothing to enthuse over in the  termination of the Satyagraha, the Kheda peasants were jubilant,  because they knew that what they had achieved was commensurate with  their effort, and they had found the true and infallible  method for a redress of their grievances. Nevertheless the Kheda peasants had not fully understood the inner  meaning of Satyagraha, and they saw it to their cost, as we shall  see in the chapters to follow. The Kheda campaign was launched while the deadly war in Europe was still  going on. I had also been urged  to attend the conference. I had not then come in close touch  with Hakim Saheb, but Principal Rudra and Dinabandhu Andrews had  told me a good deal in his praise. I had realized early enough in South Africa that there was no  genuine friendship between the Hindus and the Musalmans. I never  missed a single opportunity to remove obstacles in the way of unity. Every moment of my life I realize  that God is putting me on my trial. Having such strong convictions on the question when I returned from  South Africa, I prized the contact with the Brothers. I applied for  permission to visit the Brothers, but to no purpose. Being requested to speak, I addressed them on the duty of  the Muslims to secure the Brother's release. I felt, therefore, bound to render  what help I could in securing a due fulfillment of the prime  Minister's pledge. He invited me to discuss the question with him. That was,  they said, the first instance within living memory of anyone having  spoken in Hindustani at such a meeting. The one sentence that I uttered at the conference had for me  considerable significance. It was impossible for me to forget either  the conference or the resolution I supported. There was one  undertaking that I had to fulfill while yet in Delhi. I wanted some pure man to carry it and hand it  personally at the Viceregal Lodge. I had no objection as the letter was by no  means private. The letter thus  delivered at the hands of a pure-minded man had, as I thought, the  desired result. The other part of my obligation consisted in raising recruits. And whom could I invite to  be the first recruits except my own co-workers? If carts were not  forthcoming, it was idle to expect people to feed us. What good has  Government done for India to deserve our co-operation?' These and  similar questions used to be put to us. The Commissioners in every division were holding conferences on the  Delhi model. One of  the arguments I had used was distasteful to the Commissioner: 'Among  the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look  upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. I venture to submit that no Government can  afford to disregard the leaders, who represent the large masses of  the people as these do, even though they may hold views  fundamentally different. On that account, even as performance of duty  automatically confers a corresponding right, people are entitled to  believe that the imminent reforms alluded to in your speech will  embody the main general principles of the Congress-League Scheme,  and I am sure that it is this faith which has enabled many members  of the Conference to tender to the Government their full-hearted  co-operation. It will be national suicide not to recognize  this elementary truth. My intimate intercourse  with the ryots convinces me that India has already donated to the  Imperial Exchequer beyond her capacity. Ours is a consecration based on hope of better future. You have appealed  to us to sink domestic differences. In Kheda a population that was cursing the Government now  feels that it, and not the Government, is the power when it is  prepared to suffer for the truth it represents. Ask me to suspend my activities in that direction and you  ask me to suspend my life. I scarcely took any medicine in those days. The Hindu Anathashram where  we had our headquarters was only half a mile from the station; but  it was as good as ten for me. And my obstinacy added to their helplessness. I must  have had thrity or forty motions in twenty-four hours. I fasted, not  taking even fruit juices in the beginning. I had thought all along that I had an iron frame, but I found  that my body had now become a lump of clay. I  believed that an injection must be some kind of serum. Later I  discovered that the injection that the doctor suggested was a  vegetable substance, but the discovery was too late to be of use. The motions still continued, leaving me completely exhausted. Sheth Ambalal with his good wife came down to Nadiad, conferred with  my co-workers and removed me with the greatest care to his Mirzapur  bungalow in Ahmedabad. It was impossible for anyone to receive more  loving and selfless service than I had the privilege of having  during this illness. The news that I had no longer to worry  myself about recruiting came as a very great relief. Two or three suggested meat broth as a way out of the milk  vow, and cited authorities from Ayurveda in support of their advice. But for all of them I had but  one answer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no. This is a  nervous breakdown due to extreme weakness.' All interest in living had ceased, as I have never liked to live for  the sake of living. They certainly cannot come  under the category of meat. There are sterilized eggs on the markket.' But the  improvement was enough to give me interest in public activities. He said: 'I cannot rebuild your body unless you take milk. Moreover, I had always held that milk is not the natural diet  of man. I had therefore abjured its use altogether. 'But surely you cannot have any objection to goat's milk then,' she  interposed. It seems to me that I understand the ideal of truth better than that  of a Ahimsa, and my experience tells me that, if I let go my hold of  truth, I shall never be able to solve the riddle of Ahimsa. But in spite of this clear knowledge I cannot  see my way straight before me. Lord, give me faith' is, therefore, my prayer  day and night. I mentioned my apprehensions to Vallabhbhai, who  used to come to see me almost daily. ' Something must be done,' said  I to him. ' If I  was not laid up like this, I should give battle against it all  alone, and expect others to follow suit. Hardly a  score of persons had been invited to it. Shankarlal  Banker and Shrimati Anasuyabehn. I  followed the practice on this occasion. That was precisely the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. I could not at that time  sufficiently raise my voice at meetings. My entire frame would shake, and  heavy throbbing would start on an attempt to speak standing for any  length of time. It was with him that we  had put up in Madras. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou  should cultivate this man,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he said to me one day. I felt myself at a loss to discover how to offer  civil disobedience against the Rowlatt Bill if it was finally passed  into law. I felt the task to be beyond my  capacity, and I confessed as much to him. Let all the people of India, therefore,  suspend their business on that day and observe the day as one of  fasting and prayer. The Musalmans may not fast for more than one  day; so the duration of the fast should be twenty-four hours. The date of the hartal was first fixed on  the 30th March 1919, but was subsequently changed to 6th April. The whole of India from one end  to the other, towns as well as villages, observed a complete hartal  on that day. Swami Shraddhanandji was invited to deliver a speech in the Jumma  Masjid, which he did. All this was more than the authorities could  bear. The police checked the hartal procession as it was proceeding towards the railway station, and  opened fire, causing a number of casualties, and the reign of  repression commenced in Delhi. Shraddhanandji urgently summoned me  to Delhi. In the end I suggested that those who wanted to take the pledges  should again assemble on the following morning for the purpose. I thoroughly explained its meaning to those  present before I administered it to them. The paucity of the  attendance neither pained nor surprised me, for I have noticed this  characteristic difference in the popular attitude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c partiality for  exciting work, dislike for quiet constructive effort. I was made  to enter a third class carriage, the police party accompanying. Early at 4 o'clock the next morning I  was awoken and put in a goods train that was going towards Bombay. At noon I was again made to get down at Sawai Madhopur. I was put in a first class compartment with him. Whereupon the officer, seeing  no other course, told me that he would have to enforce law against  me. ' It would however be better,' he added, 'if you get  down near the Marine Lines where I shall get the train stopped for  you. At Colaba there is likely to be a big crowd.' The carriage of a  friend just happened to be passing by. It took me and left me at  Revashankar Jhaveri's place. An outbreak is apprehended every minute near Pydhuni, the  Magistrate and the police have already arrived there,' he added. Near Pydhuni I saw that a huge crowd had gathered. At Pydhuni we sighted a body of mounted police. I hardly imagine they could see what they were doing. If we did  not start with drastic measures, the situation would pass out of our  hands. I tell you that the people are sure to go out of your  control. 'It is there that I join issue with you,' I replied. ' 'Yes, I wanted to do so by the next available train. I am not yet in  possession of all the facts. 'I assure you I should readily take it upon myself wherever I  discovered it. But I should be deeply pained and surprised, if I  found that there were disturbances in Ahmedabad. But even  about the Punjab I am certain of this much that, had not the Punjab  Government prevented my entry into the Punjab, I should have been  considerably helpful in keeping the peace there. By preventing me  they gave the people unnecessary provocation.' The  mill-hands had gone mad over her rumoured arrest, struck work and  committed acts of violence, and a sergeant had been done to death. I learnt that an attempt had been made to  pull up the rails near the Nadiad railway station, that a Government  officer had been murdered in Viramgam, and that Ahmedabad was under  martial law. They had indulged in  acts of violence and were being made to pay for them with interest. Just as I suggested to the people to confess their guilt, I  suggested to the Government to condone the crimes. If those  amongst whom I worked, and whom I expected to be prepared for  non-violence and self-suffering, could not be non-violent,  Satyagraha was certainly impossible. Let us now see what that Himalayan miscalculation was. With these thoughts filling my mind I reached Bombay, raised a corps  of Satyagrahi volunteers through the Satyagraha Sabha there, and  with their help commenced the work of educating the people with  regard to the meaning and inner significance of Satyagraha. In Amritsar innocent men and  women were made to crawl like worms on their bellies. I was thus confronted by a serious dilemma. As things  stood, to break the order against my entry into the Punjab could, it  seemed to me, hardly be classed as civil disobedience, for I did not  see around me the kind of peaceful atmosphere that I wanted, and the  unbridled repression in the Punjab had further served to aggravate  and deepen the feelings of resentment. I therefore readily  accepted the suggestion made by these friends. This  monthly was converted into a weekly. I had already  learnt from my experience of Indian Opinion that such journals  needed a press of their own.", "1920": "From its very inception the khadi movement, Swadeshi movement as it was  then called, evoked much criticism from the mill-owners. The Bengalis should have known that their  agitation was bound to send up the price of Swadeshi cloth by  stimulating the demand for it.' This is the latest variety turned out by our mill. You  can thus see that we do not stand in need of more agents. Besides,  you ought to know that India's production of cloth falls far short  of its requirements. The question of Swadeshi, therefore, largely  resolves itself into one of production. he exclaimed, a bit puzzled, 'but maybe, you  are thinking of promoting the establishment of new mills, in which  case you certainly deserve to be congratulated.' Our mills will not be in want of custom for a long  time to come. My work should be, and therefore is, to organize the  production of handspun cloth, and to find means for the disposal of  the khadi thus produced. On the contrary to the extent that it  can add to the cloth production of the country, be it ever so small,  it will represent so much solid gain. In the beginning the late Hakim Saheb  was sceptical as to the practicability of non-violent non-co-  operation. But after his scepticism was overcome he threw himself  into it heart and soul, and his help proved invaluable to the  movement. Preparations were made for it on a large scale. At Calcutta there was a mammoth gathering  of delegates and visitors. I  invariably made use of this word in my speeches. Thus, while I was still busy devising suitable Hindi, Gujarati and  Urdu phraseology for non-co-operation, I was called upon to frame  the non-co-operation resolution for that eventful Congress. But I have an impression that the draft was  printed before the insertion could be made. The Subjects Committee  was to have met the same evening. The absence of Swaraj was the biggest wrong that  the country was labouring under; it should be against that that non-co-operation should be directed', he argued. I still remember the  sweet discussion that I had with him on the resolution. He suggested  some changes in its phraseology which I adopted. He undertook to win  the Deshabandhu for the movement. It was only at  the Nagpur Congress that he and Lalaji accepted it whole heartedly. But even if it had been otherwise, and he had  opposed the movement, I should still have esteemed his opposition as  a privilege and an education for myself. The resolutions adopted at the Calcutta special session of the Congress  were to be confirmed at its annual session at Nagpur. Similarly some amendments were made at the instance of the  Deshabandhu, after which the non-co-operation resolution was passed  unanimously. In my draft the  number of delegates had been fixed, I think, at 1,500; the Subjects  Committee substituted in its place the figure 6,000. Resolutions about Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability  and khadi too were passed in this Congress, and since then the Hindu  members of the Congress have taken upon themselves the  responsibility of ridding Hinduism of the curse of untouchability,  and the Congress has established a living bond of relationship with  the 'skeletons' of India through khadi.", "1921": "The time has now come to bring these chapters to a close. Moreover, since  1921 I have worked in such close association with the Congress  leaders that I can hardly describe any episode in my life since then  without referring to my relations with them. The history  of the Congress, since the great changes in it that I have described  above, is still in the making. I do not know whether I have  been able to do justice to them. I can only say that I have spared  no pains to give a faithful narrative. The little fleeting glimpses, therefore, that I have  been able to have of Truth can hardly convey an idea of the  indescribable lustre of Truth, a million times more intense than  that of the sun we daily see with our eyes. Identification with everything that lives is impossible without  self-purification; without self-purification the observance of the  law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream; God can never be realized  by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification therefore must  mean purification in all the walks of life. So long as a man does not of his own free will put himself  last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him.", "1924": "I soon came in contact with the Christian Indians living in Durban. Whilst I was thus widening the circle of my acquaintance, the firm  received a letter from their lawyer saying that preparations should  be made for the case, and that Abdulla Sheth should go to Pretoria  himself or send a representative. Book-keeping  I had learnt neither at school nor during my stay in England. Only one who knew accounts could understand and explain  it. The clerk went on talking about this debited and that credited,  and I felt more and more confused. Wherever you want me to,'  said I. 'Then I shall write to our lawyer. The other party has great  influence in Pretoria. Not a soul shall know  anything that is confidential between us. But we are all relatives and know one another very well  indeed. I thanked him and asked him not to be anxious. The train reached Maritzburg, the capital of Natal, at about 9 p.m.  Beddings used to be provided at this station. Out he went and  came in again with one or two officials. They all kept quiet, when  another official came to me and said, 'Come along, you must go to  the van compartment.' ' I refused to go to the other compartment  and the train steamed away. The railway authorities had taken charge of it. A passenger came in at about midnight and  possibly wanted to talk to me. The following morning I sent a long telegram to the General Manager  of the Railway and also informed Abdulla Sheth, who immediately met  the General Manager. I  now purchased at Maritzburg the bedding ticket I had refused to book  at Durban. There was no railway, in  those days, between Charlestown and Johannesburg, but only a stage-coach, which halted at Standerton for the night  en route. There were seats  on either side of the coachbox. So he took a piece of dirty  sack-cloth from the driver, spread it on the footboard and,  addressing me, said, 'Sami, you sit on this, I want to sit near the driver.' As I was struggling through these sentences, the man came down upon  me and began heavily to box my ears. I clung to the brass rails of the coachbox  and was determined to keep my hold even at the risk of breaking my  wrist bones. No fear,' cried the man, but he seemed somewhat  crestfallen and stopped beating me. I also asked for an assurance that he would accommodate me with  the other passengers inside the coach when we started the next  morning. To which the agent replied to this effect: 'From Standerton  we have a bigger coach with different men in charge. I had, of  course, no intention of proceeding against the man who had assaulted  me, and so the chapter of the assault closed there. Only we can live in a land like this, because, for making  money, we do not mind pocketing insults, and here we are.' With this  he narrated to me the story of the hardships of Indians in South  Africa. Of Sheth Abdul Gani we shall know more as we proceed. Sheth Abdul Gani drew my attention to the extra time and money this  would mean, but agreed to my proposal to travel first, and  accordingly we sent a note to the Station Master. There was of course a purpose behind asking  for the reply in person. I shall be much obliged if you will give me a ticket. He smiled and, moved to pity, said: 'I am not a Transvaaler."}
